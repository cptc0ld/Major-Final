Nevertheless, none compare to the massive appreciation seen within the cryptocurrency sector.

Warning: If you are primarily an equity investor, you may soon be compelled to enter the world of cryptocurrencies as the relative outperformance of the top cryptocurrencies in 2017, when compared to equity markets, was astronomical.

The top-performing stock market last year (excluding Venezuela with a 3,884 percent gain due to rampant inflation) was Zimbabwe with a 117.7 percent advance, while the top cryptocurrency Ripple, left Zimbabwe in the dust with an eye-popping 28,963 percent return. Ripple ended 2016 at $0.0065 and by Dec. 31, 2017 had risen to $2.25.

By the end of 2017 Ripple has overtaken Ethereum as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, at $77.1 bln and $72.9 bln, respectively. Although still far behind Bitcoin’s approximately $248.3 bln market capitalization, they are rising fast. The market capitalization of Ripple is up approximately 31,637 percent from a year ago and Ethereum has increased around 1,300 percent. A distant third is Bitcoin, up 447 percent over the past 12 months.

Top stock market performance 2017

As you can see in the following table, Top Stock Market Performance 2017, relatively high returns came from less developed and emerging stock markets such as Argentina with a 77.7 percent return, Mongolia which rose by 68.9 percent, and Kazakhstan, climbing by 59.3 percent. Of course, for most investors, there are barriers to accessing these stock markets. That may be one of the reason’s global investors have taken a liking to cryptocurrencies as they are global, can be accessed and traded 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Major developed equity markets

In major developed stock markets, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index led the way with a 36 percent return, followed by India’s BSE Sensex 30, up 27.9 percent. The Hang Seng ended December at 29,919.15, close to the high for the year, and the second highest monthly closing price ever, second only to the record high peak from November 2007 of 31,958.41.

Since 2009 low the Hang Seng has been progressing higher in an ascending parallel trend channel. The index is now heading towards the top channel line, which will put it in the area to test resistance around the 2007 highs. That’s only 6 percent or so higher. It’s interesting to note that the Hang Seng has only had one down month during 2017, a testament to its strength.

India’s BSE Sensex 30 Index ended the year almost 10 percentage points lower than the Hang Seng, but a strong finish nonetheless. The Sensex had a solid close at a record high of 34,057, very close to the year’s high of 34,127.22. December triggered a monthly bullish trend continuation signal and follows a breakout of a two-year base in May. This is very healthy price behavior and supportive of a continuation of the bullish trend. As long as the Sensex continues to progress with a series of high monthly highs and higher monthly lows, further upside is likely.

The third best performing major stock market index last year was the S&P 500 (SPX), up 19.4 percent to end at 2,674. For the past 13 months the SPX has advanced as much as 29.3 percent, as of the year’s 2,694.97 high, in a sequential series of higher monthly highs and higher monthly lows, all in the face of growing choir of bears, waiting and ready to bounce. This monthly pattern continues to define a strong uptrend.

In addition to ending the year technically strong, in the upper third of December’s high-to-low price range, the close was at a new monthly closing high. When measuring the current advance from the February 2016 swing low, the SPX was up as much as 48 percent as of the recent high.

Can it keep going? Well, the prior rally (swing low to swing high) on a monthly basis, starting from October 2011, saw the SPX increase as much as 99 percent before moving into a prolonged consolidation base period. So far the advance is approximately half of that. By itself, this would indicate more upside potential.

Bottom stock market performance

Of course, not all stock markets were bullish last year, but the worst performers were relatively smaller exchanges. The bottom performing market for 2017 was the Sarajevo Stock Exchange. It ended the year down 18.5 percent to close at 562. Coming in second was the Qatar Exchange Index, with a loss of 18.3 percent, followed by the Karachi Stock Exchange Index, which dropped by 15.3 percent. Qatar, of course, has been negatively impacted by an economic blockade since June spearheaded by Saudi Arabia with support from other Arabian Gulf countries.

Cryptocurrencies: 2017 performance

This next chart shows the performance of the five of the larger cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC/USD). The cryptocurrencies shown in this chart and the accompanying table further down, is not comprehensive and is chosen as a sample of the more popular and widely traded cryptocurrencies.

It is interesting to see that the cryptocurrencies shown all started to accelerate higher around early-November, except for Ripple (XRP/USD). Ripple was late to the party but doesn’t seem to be losing any time making up for the slow start. You can see how it has been rising rapidly recently while the other major cryptos start to pullback. For the month of December Ripple has advanced more than 700 percent. The Ripple token is used to facilitate global payments by banks and other financial institutions.

Following the strong performance of Ripple is Dash (DASH/USD). Dash was up at least 9,400 percent for 2017 through Dec. 31. Dash broke out of a 32-month base into new high territory in February and has barely looked back. Over the past 10 months, since the breakout, Dash as advanced as much as 10,584 percent, as of its recent high of $1,595.76 reached in December. So far, since reaching that high, Dash has moved into a pullback, falling as much as 51 percent before bouncing.

Ethereum (ETH/USD) was the third-best performer for the year, up at about 9,000 percent to $757 at Dec 31. It started 2017 very strong, rising over 5,000 percent in the first five months before moving into a four-month or so consolidation phase. A classic symmetrical triangle consolidation pattern formed subsequent to the top. Ethereum broke out of that pattern with conviction in November, rising a little over 100 percent before confronting resistance at $863.0 last decade of December and sliding into a retracement. To date, the retracement has seen as much as a 40 percent loss in value from the high.

In fourth place comes Litecoin (LTC/USD), with a 5,582 percent advance of the year so far. Litecoin has been pulling back over the past couple of weeks, since hitting resistance at a record high of $420.0. That high completed a 735.8 percent increase in only six weeks, starting at the low of a three-week pullback at the beginning of November. The move was accompanied by increasing volume until the top, which is where weekly volume reached a record high.

Let’s now jump to Bitcoin, which comes in sixth place for the year out of the cryptocurrencies selected. Of course, Bitcoin has been the one getting much of the attention in the sector since the summer. It is up 1,390 percent year-to-date and was up as much as 1,935 percent at the record high of $19,666 hit mid-December. Interestingly, the second highest volume week of the past two years was seen in the next week following that record high. That was a down week.

Bitcoin had been advancing in a nicely formed parallel trend channel since the first quarter of the year until later in November. At that point, Bitcoin broke out through the top trend line of the channel and began to accelerate higher. This can be seen in the increase in the angle of ascent of price in the following chart.

Going back one to fifth place is Monero (XMR/USD). Monero is up 2,481 percent. It ended 2016 at $5.90 and jumped to at least $348.02 over the subsequent 12 months. This coin has been a steady progression higher throughout the year and recently hit a record high of $477 before pulling back. It remains in a clear uptrend.

IOTA (IOT/USD) takes seventh place with an advance of 1,356 percent since June, when it was launched. The high for 2017 was two weeks ago at $5.80. At the point, IOTA was up over 1,700 percent in just seven weeks. It subsequently declined as much as 80 percent off the high.

Finally, there is Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD), released in August. Since then BCH has risen to $2,553 from $320. It continues to progress in an uptrend with higher swing highs and higher swing lows. It was up as much as 1,150 percent at the recent $4,000.10 high from Dec. 20.",,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-could-be-adding-03-to-japanese-gdp-2017-12-1012383972,"CoinMarketCap

The rise in the value of bitcoin could be adding 0.3% to Japanese GDP growth, according to Nomura.

Bitcoin trades are disproportionately transacted in yen, and about 1 million Japanese people hold about 3.7 million bitcoins.

The ""wealth effect"" will boost consumer spending.

""The scale of this increase in assets can hardly be ignored,"" the two analysts say.

More evidence that the cryptocurrency world is having a greater effect on the real world economy.

The rise in the value of bitcoin could be adding 0.3% to Japanese GDP growth, according to Nomura analysts Yoshiyuki Suimon and Kazuki Miyamoto.

In a recent note to clients, they argued that the ""wealth effect"" on Japanese bitcoin holders is likely to spur consumer spending that will have a measurable effect on GDP.

The note is interesting because analysts and economists have largely assumed that bitcoin is both too small in market capitalisation, and too unconnected to other financial institutions, to affect the real-world economy. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies on December 31, 2017, was $560 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, but only three of the top 500 online retailers accept bitcoin as payment.

However, traditional financial institutions have recently begun introducing their clients to the cryptocurrency world. Cboe, CME Group and Goldman Sachs have all made moves to clear bitcoin futures and other derivatives. Goldman is also opening a crypto trading desk. And users on crypto exchanges like Bitfinex and Tokyo-based bitFlyer are making leveraged bets on bitcoin.

As bitcoin's value has flirted with $20,000, many people who bought it prior to the beginning of 2017 are now feeling much, much richer. ""The scale of this increase in assets can hardly be ignored,"" the two analysts say.

In economics, the ""wealth effect"" is the measurable increase in economic activity that occurs when asset prices rise, making consumers feel richer, and boosting their spending. This phenomenon was pronounced in the run-up to the 2008 credit crisis, when soaring property prices made homeowners feel wealthier than they ever thought they would be. With their houses gaining in value, those consumers splashed out with their spare cash — juicing the economy as a whole.

Bitcoin is popular in Japan — 40% of all trades are in yen, more than the US dollar share. About 1 million Japanese people hold about 3.7 million bitcoin, Nomura estimates. Suimon and Miyamoto calculate that the wealth effect of those holdings could trigger ¥96 billion ($851 million) of extra consumption.

NomuraThe market cap of bitcoin traded in yen had increased to roughly ¥5.1 trillion ($4.52 billion) by Christmas Day, Nomura said. That would give Japanese holders a rise in asset value of ¥3.2 trillion ($3 billion) over the year:

""Generally speaking, rises in asset values often result in a rise in consumer spending too, known as the wealth effect. In this report, we estimate the wealth effect from unrealized gains on Bitcoin trading by Japanese investors since the start of FY17, and estimate a potential boost to consumer spending of ¥23.2-96.0bn

... Moreover, the fact that the rise in Bitcoin prices was concentrated in 2017 Q4 could result in the wealth effect materializing in 2018 Q1, and if that is the case, we estimate a potential boost to real GDP growth on an annualized q-q basis of up to about 0.3ppt (¥96.0bn / ¥130trn × 4).""

Nomura

The basis of their calculation comes from a range of historical studies of the wealth effect of asset rises on Japanese economy. What the pair don't say — but their data implies — is that if the rising price of bitcoin can add to GDP growth it can also take it away again, should the cryptocurrency market crash.

January 1, 2018 This article is more than 2 years old.

Bitcoin’s value grew by more than 1,000% in 2017, but that wasn’t enough to even place it among the 10 best-performing cryptoassets of the year.

In a breakout year for cryptocurrency trading, the biggest winners were Ripple, which is touted as a new kind of payment system for banks, along with less familiar names like NEM, Ardor, and Dash. Here are the top 10 cryptoassets of 2017—plus bitcoin, which came in 14th place:

Cryptoassets include standalone cryptocurrencies as well as tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain. Our ranking is based on a comparison of the yearlong gains made by the 10 most valuable cryptoassets as of Jan. 1, 2018, as measured by data provider CoinMarketcap.

Ripple’s big gains—it rose an astonishing 36,000%—came largely at the tail end of the year. Here’s how its 2017 looked compared to bitcoin:

Bitcoin fares slightly better when compared against rival cryptocurrencies, meaning tokens with their own blockchains. This excludes tokens issued through so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), which were a craze last year. Bitcoin makes it to eighth place in this ranking, although it’s still trounced by ethereum and litecoin:

The ICO craze attracted over $3.7 billion in funds this year, according to data provider Coin Schedule. Many of these projects only launched months ago. Yet big names like Golem and OmiseGo lagged behind lesser known ones like Ardor in the performance charts.

Bitcoin’s performance may seem lackluster compared to its newer, shinier, brethren, but it’s worth putting its gains in context. After all, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 27% last year.

It’s difficult to imagine cryptoassets delivering another year of crazy gains in 2018.

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency traded between people or used to purchase goods outside of banks or government regulation — that's part of what makes it risky. Figuring out exactly who is putting money into this kind of asset is difficult because part of the attraction of investing in the crypto realm is the assurance of anonymity.

But survey after survey backs up what the anecdotal evidence suggests — women are underrepresented.

Google Analytics results put the divide at 96.57 per cent men to 3.43 per cent women.

That's a huge red flag to Duncan Stewart, research director of Deloitte Canada's technology division.

""It isn't merely that the value has risen as far and as fast as it has; it's the fact that it's 97 per cent men — that is, in and of itself, a potential danger sign,"" he says.

""There are studies out there that suggest men are predisposed towards bubbles in a way that women are not.""

Stewart made his case in a recent online post about the subject. Stewart said he ""cannot think of any security, currency or asset class in history that shows that extreme a gender divide and has been sustainable.""

Men make up the overwhelming majority of the bitcoin community, according to various anecdotal sources like this Google analytics pie chart.

One reason is the well-documented lower risk tolerance of female investors. In other words, if women aren't getting involved, it's likely too risky, this line of thinking suggests.

The most comprehensive study on gender and the stock market shows that women who invest — whether their own money or on behalf of an organization — take a more cautious approach but tend to outperform their male peers in the long run.

'Role models are needed'

Stewart says he saw this in action during the dot-com boom and bust in the early 2000s.

Back then, he was an award-winning technology fund manager on Bay Street. Female fund managers represented about 20 per cent of institutional investors at the time, but they shied away from the tech stocks the men were heavily invested in.

He recalls his female colleagues being mocked for not jumping in with as much fervour as the men — until the men began losing lots of money.

""Maybe they 'got' it better than the men did all along,"" Stewart said.

Iliana Oris Valiente, co-founder of the blockchain initiative Rubix, says when she entered the world of cryptocurrencies, 'I was regularly the only female in the room, period.' (Accenture)

Iliana Oris Valiente is a rarity in the cryptocurrency world. She has emerged as a female leader in this space and was recently chosen to lead consulting firm Accenture's global blockchain innovation division (blockchain is the technology behind cryptocurrencies).

A chartered accountant by training, she began her career in the world of auditing but got hooked on bitcoin as soon as she heard of it in 2012.

Oris Valiente says when she entered the world of cryptocurrencies it was a noticeably male-dominated industry.

""In 2014, when this started to become a core component of my day job, I was regularly the only female in the room, period,"" she said.

She says things are changing, albeit slowly. ""We're starting to see really strong females in leadership roles,"" she said.

For instance, of the largest initial coin offerings (or ICOs, which are fundraising mechanisms for blockchain-related projects) currently underway, about 13 per cent are headed by women.

""They're acting as very powerful role models, and these role models are needed to encourage other women to potentially look at this field,"" said Oris Valiente.

Glaring gender divide

Oris Valiente doesn't buy into the theory that an outsized amount of male interest in a particular asset in and of itself creates a bubble.

""If we have primarily men involved in building the businesses and being the early-stage investors, they're likely to share the new tidbits and the new deals with their own established networks.""

But without a major catalyst, she doesn't see the gender divide in this field narrowing anytime soon.

So Oris Valiente is spreading the word herself, reaching out to hundreds of women through speaking engagements, trying to convince them that this is a field where they're needed.

""I'm sharing my personal journey into this ecosystem, explaining the basics of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, outlining what the different opportunities are ... as this ecosystem continues to grow.""

She's convinced this technology is here to stay.

Signs of a bubble

The debate continues over whether the surge in interest and investment in cryptocurrencies is really a bubble.

Stewart points out that savvy people can make money during a bubble. ""As long as you are one of those incredibly clever people who buys when it's low and sells on the way up.""

But if cryptocurrencies are here to stay, Stewart says the gender divide will sort itself out over time. ""Either it is a bubble, or it does turn out to be a real important currency that people use for the purchase of legal goods and services and as a store of value,"" he said.

""If that happens, women will show up to the party. Late, in this case, but they will show up.""",,https://www.coindesk.com/video-shapeshift-ceo-erik-voorhees-makes-sense-crypto-assets,"This is an entry in CoinDesk’s Most Influential in Blockchain 2017 series.

For daily updates, subscribe to our newsletter by clicking here.

A class action lawsuit against Tel Aviv-listed solar energy company Apollo Power Ltd. was filed Thursday in Tel Aviv District Court. The plaintiff, investor Eli Buchris, alleges in his complaint that the company filed a misleading report to the TASE in an attempt to influence investors.

Apollo Power Chairman Itschak Sherm. Daniel de Albi

The lawsuit names Apollo Power Chairman Itschak Sherm, CEO Oded Rozenberg and company directors Eran Maimon, Lior Vider, Ziv Erez, and Vered Raz-Avayo as defendants.

On December 18, Apollo Power announced a successful experiment in harnessing its surplus solar energy to power crypto-mining machines. In the report, the company indicated that the experiment constituted a technological breakthrough, adding that it had filed for a patent in the U.S. for a modular solar system containing a built-in crypto mining component. By that day’s market close, Apollo Power’s stock was up 38%, adding around $4 million (NIS 14 million) to its market capitalization.

A few hours before that day’s market close, Apollo Power filed a second announcement, following a demand made by the Israeli securities authority for further clarification. Apollo Power then divulged that it had conducted the 30-minute experiment three days earlier and that the company was able to mine 0.00054 Ethereum coins, equivalent to 4 cents given the exchange rates at the time. At this rate, the company said, it could potentially mine Ethereum coins worth $130 a year.

Apollo Power concluded the second report by stating that their solar system’s current capacity did not enable it to mine bitcoins. The company did not supply information about the operational costs of the system described.

On December 19, Apollo Power’s stock went down nearly 32%. The company’s market capitalization, which increased from $10.7 million (NIS 37.8 million) to $14.8 million (NIS 52 million) the day before, had gone back down to $10 million (NIS 35.6 million).

In his suit, Mr. Buchris said he is one of a group of investors who acted quickly to purchase Apollo Power stock following the company’s first announcement, believing it to be a reliable presentation of the company’s potential entry into cryptocurrency. Mr. Buchris said that the second report, filed later that day, showed the first report was “partial, misleading, false, deceitful, and at the very least negligent.”

Mr. Buchris alleges that Apollo Power caused major financial damage to him and other investors, valued at many millions of shekels.

Following a request for comment, Apollo Power said that it did not receive the lawsuit.

Apollo Power listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in early November after merging with a shelf company and has been trading with a market capitalization of around $11.7 million (NIS 41 million) before announcing the cryptocurrency experiment. It is one of four Tel Aviv-listed companies to recently announce plans to begin operations in businesses related to cryptocurrency or blockchain technology and subsequently added approximately $200 million (NIS 700 million) to their combined value in past months.

The stock of Tel Aviv-listed Natural Resource Holdings Ltd. shot up around 4,000% since October when the shelf company first said it is considering a pivot to cryptocurrency. In December, digital marketing company Apply Advanced Mobile Technologies Ltd. announced its intention to establish a blockchain and cryptocurrency venture, sending its stock up 252% by that day’s market close. Also in December, Tel Aviv-based Fantasy Network Ltd. announced it had hired a blockchain advisor, sending its stock up 44% by that day’s market close. The next day, the stock was up an additional 80%.

In response, the Israeli securities authority announced in December it will not allow companies whose value is dependent on bitcoin to be included in the exchange’s indices.",2018-01-01,,,,,,

On Tuesday, its market cap was $231.8 billion, or around 36.1 percent of the total value of all cryptocurrencies. This is the lowest share of the market that bitcoin has had in its history.

Bitcoin's previous low was 37.6 percent in June. By contrast, at the start of 2017, its market share stood at over 80 percent.

Dominance refers to the percentage a single virtual currency has of the market capitalization or value of every cryptocurrency in the world. The total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency world stood at $640.4 billion on Tuesday, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com.

Bitcoin rallied by more than 1,300 percent in 2017. In December, it hit a record high of $19,783.21 before a sharp sell-off saw it plunge, closing the year at $13,889.99, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, which tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex.

The decline of bitcoin's dominance, which on Dec. 1 stood at around 55 percent, is due to the pullback in price, but also rising interest in other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, ripple and litecoin.

On Dec. 1, for example, ripple's value stood at around 3 percent of the entire market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. On Tuesday, it was over 14 percent. Ripple's price rose over 36,000 percent in 2017 and it is now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

Investors appear to be taking a breather from bitcoin for now and looking at alternative cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has divided the financial and business world. Last year, J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a ""fraud."" And last week, The Gartman Letter editor and publisher Dennis Gartman told CNBC that bitcoin would trade under $5,000.

Ethereum's surge comes as bitcoin remains under pressure.



LONDON — Cryptocurrency ethereum posted a fresh all-time high on Tuesday morning, shaking off the troubles that have dragged down the price of its better established rival, bitcoin, in recent weeks.

By 1.00 p.m. GMT (8.00 a.m. ET) on Tuesday, the price of ethereum has climbed more than 12% to trade at around $847. Earlier in the morning it climbed as high as $880, it's record high, as the chart below illustrates:

Ethereum, which has been the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation for some time, saw that crown come under threat during the Christmas period after a huge surge in the price of XRP, a currency created by Ripple that is focused on bank transfers.

As Business Insider's Frank Chaparro noted late in December, the cryptocurrency has been on a tear since Ripple's Asian subsidiary and a group of Japanese credit card companies announced a new consortium Wednesday. The consortium aims to identify how blockchain and distributed ledger technology can be deployed in credit card payments.

Some in the crypto markets believe that because XRP is now backed by this consortum, it could be more successful in finding a successful practical application for blockchain.

According to coinmarketcap.com, Ripple's total capitalisation is now around $91 billion, while ethereum's is roughly $85 billion.

""A fierce battle is playing out in the crypto world at the moment between Ethereum and Ripple,"" Mati Greenspan, an analyst for eToro said in an email on Tuesday morning.

""While Bitcoin has been declining in market share, Ripple was on a massive run. The logic is that if bitcoin fails to replace the banking system, the current institutions may just use the Ripple network to integrate blockchain technology, speed up transactions, and lower prices.""

Ethereum's fresh high comes as bitcoin remains under pressure after dropping from $19,000 to around $13,000 in a matter of days.

Despite recovering above $14,000, Bitcoin has failed to hold on to prices closer to its all-time highs of $20,000 seen in December.

By contrast, investor money has poured back into altcoin markets, with the majority of major assets appreciating dramatically and weathering short-term volatility.

At press time, gains were being spearheaded by Ethereum’s Ether (ETH), which continues to profit from the anticipation of a long-awaited Casper release. The technology’s alpha testnet was formally unveiled December 31.

In a follow-up blog post today, co-founder Vitalik Buterin also announced a grant program and so-called Blockchain ‘sharding,’ both of which aim to shore up longer-term Ethereum network scalability. Buterin summarized:

We view the two strategies as complementary with each other and we believe in supporting a multi-pronged strategy toward Ethereum scalability that engages both strategies and treats them as complementary with each other.

Scaling Specters

Elsewhere in altcoin markets, several coins in the top 20 have seen significant recent gains, including Bitcoin hard fork Bitcoin Cash, which is heading towards $3000 per coin after falling more heavily than Bitcoin itself during its rout below $13,000 last month.

Ripple is also heading back towards all-time highs above $2.40, while NEO has surged to approach $93 per token, almost trebling in value in under a month.

Commenting on current trends, Noded Podcast presenter and Bitcoin maximalist Pierre Rochard noted differing philosophies regarding scaling in Bitcoin and Ethereum camps.

Despite the incoming release of Lightning Network improvements for Bitcoin, the issue of its usefulness purely as a currency remains a decisive topic of debate.

Contrast between the BTC and ETH scaling philosophies:

BTC: self-interest, decentralized bounty from fee market, engineers

ETH: charity, centralized grants from Ethereum Foundation, researchers pic.twitter.com/RCnbOcpsLN — Pierre Rochard (@pierre_rochard) January 2, 2018

The largest cryptocurrency meanwhile had been recovering its share of the market, surpassing multi-month highs of 66% before a major reversal halved the figure in a matter of weeks.

Investor Peter Thiel has reportedly made an all-in, rather giant, bet on bitcoin. Mainstream financial press is reporting his venture capital fund purchased and held the digital asset through last year’s thousand percent-plus gains, making the decentralized currency one of his firm’s most valuable investments.

Peter Thiel’s Moonshot Bet

“Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency,” bitcoin, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. “The bet has been spread across several of the firm’s most recent funds,” they claim, citing unnamed sources, and include “one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments.”

Paypal? They chortled; we have credit cards! Won’t make money. Facebook? They dismissed; Myspace exists! Doomed to failure. Donald Trump? They howled; Hillary Clinton has it in the bag! There is no way he can become President. Bitcoin? They mocked; it’s used only by weirdos and geeks! It died in 2011.

Maverick investor Peter Thiel has made a career of going against conventional wisdom, and he’s at it again, venturing where few of his peers will dare. This time, he’s placing what’s been called “a moonshot bet on bitcoin.”

Mr. Thiel, 50, is best known as a venture capitalist, but he’s about as well-rounded as they come. He earned a law degree from Stanford, traded derivatives, clerked for a circuit court judge, and even wrote speeches for the Secretary of Education.

A principal focus these days is his Founders Fund, which he started in 2005 from San Francisco. It doesn’t have a mission statement – it has a manifesto, asking the question: “What happened to the future?” Its portfolio has contained everything from Spacex, Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb, to Facebook.

Markets Rocked

Speculation by the media has Founders Fund buying “around $15 million to $20 million in bitcoin, and it has told investors the firm’s haul is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the digital currency’s ripping rise in the past year,” and no one seems to know if they’ve begun to take profits.

Afternoon news of the bet shook markets, and though bitcoin’s price had been lethargic it suddenly began shooting up, reaching as high as 15,000 USD by this writing. Market reasoning can be many-faceted, but a venture firm buying bitcoin straight, no chaser, and holding it is something new. And the idea its “bitcoin investment is already estimated as the most valuable in the Founders’ most recent $1.3 billion venture fund,” according to reporting, is downright shocking.

The move is daring, even for Mr. Thiel, in an environment where bitcoin could literally go to zero, or something close. Boisterous, media-seeking venture capitalists such as Michael Novogratz spooked easily after late December 2017’s double-digit price drop, saying “we didn’t like market conditions for new investors” and postponed a planned crypto fund. Indeed, entire countries like China and South Korea, among others, are cracking down if not outright banning the world’s most popular cryptocurrency.

Whatever the case, Mr. Thiel’s reputation for unconventional thinking has won him many hundreds of millions as reward. And it appears the market, this time at least, wishes to bet on his hunch as much as bitcoin.

The South Korean government has been working on a system to enforce real-name identity verification on cryptocurrency traders. This system is expected to be implemented around January 20, thus ending the current practice which allows for anonymous crypto trading.

Government’s Real-Name System

The Korean government announced last week its decision “to implement a virtual currency trading real-name system as a special measure to eradicate virtual currency speculation.” According to Yonhap, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday:

The South Korean government has been developing a system that is likely to start banning the use of anonymous accounts in cryptocurrency transactions from around Jan. 20.

So far, Koreans have been able to trade cryptocurrencies anonymously through the use of virtual accounts, which are issued by banks for crypto exchanges to assign to their customers. However, the regulators believe that these accounts are “used as virtual currency trading accounts to disseminate speculation and hinder transparency in financial transactions.” The issuance of new virtual accounts have now been prohibited, which major crypto exchanges have already complied, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

Other Crypto Regulatory Plans

The government also announced that it will “strengthen banks’ anti-money laundering obligation on virtual currency exchanges.” This will require financial institutions to report suspicious transactions related to crypto exchanges to the authorities. Banks must also “exclude financial services for unhealthy exchanges that do not follow the government’s emergency measures,” the regulators described.

Furthermore, “the prosecutors and police have set up a plan to crack down on virtual currency-related crimes in 2018.” They will investigate illegal acts such as market manipulation and arrest the people in charge, the government explained.

At the meeting last week of the Korean National Economic Advisory Council, presided over by President Moon Jae-in, the Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon announced the country’s “2018 economic policy direction.”

It includes plans for the National Police Agency to intensify the crackdown on illegal crypto activities. The Korea Customs Service, the prosecutors’ office, and the police have been put in charge of investigating actual violations of the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. Meanwhile, “the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Korea Communications Commission will periodically check cryptocurrency exchanges,” the regulator detailed.

Check our tools section.",2018-01-03 01:48:58+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-is-bitcoin-affecting-the-environment/,"The growth of bitcoin is fueling speculation and debate about the environmental impact of the collective energy needed to power the virtual currency in the era of climate change. Some questions and answers about the issue:

What is bitcoin?

A bitcoin itself is essentially a line of computer code. It's signed digitally when it goes from one owner to another. The price of bitcoin exploded in 2017, surging from less than $1,000 at the beginning of the year to $13,483, according to tracking site Coindesk.

Bitcoin is believe to have been created in 2009 by an anonymous person known as Satoshi Nakamoto as a new way of paying for things that would not be subject to central banks that are capable of devaluing currency. Bitcoin is the most popular of more than 1,000 ""cryptocurrencies"" that have emerged in recent years, with digital monies like Dash, Ethereum and Litecoin also seeing a massive jump in price.

Prominent economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Wall Street bankers say the bitcoin market is a bubble. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued warnings about the risk of investing in bitcoin and other digital currencies. In the meantime, major U.S. exchanges have started trading in bitcoin futures.

Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox

The sustainability concerns about bitcoin, voiced by economists and environmentalists, stem from the process of ""mining"" that is central to its existence.

The ""miners"" use computers to make complex calculations that verify transactions in bitcoins. This uses a tremendous amount of energy via computers and server farms all over the world, which has given rise to concerns about the amount of fossil fuel-dependent electricity used to power the computers. Some estimates say bitcoin's energy impact is more than that of a small country.

Why is bitcoin attractive?

Bitcoin is a kind of digital money that isn't tied to a bank or a government, and its value has risen swiftly in the second half of 2017. The value of one bitcoin was about $16,500, in late December, compared with about $1,000 in March. The price is also volatile, though, and tailed off somewhat after coming close to $20,000 earlier in December. Why are critics concerned about bitcoin energy use?

Bitcoin can't exist without computers, which can't exist without a source of electricity. And the number of computers and the energy needed to power them is rising.

The growing value of bitcoin is directly tied to the amount of energy it uses. The miners unlock bitcoins by solving complex, unique puzzles. As the value of bitcoin goes up, the puzzles become increasingly more difficult, and it requires more computer power to solve them.

Some estimates say more than 60 percent of the processing power used to mine bitcoin is in China, where it relies heavily on the burning of coal. Coal and other fossil fuels are also the largest generator of electricity for the rest of the world, and coal is a significant contributor to manmade climate change. Burning it produces carbon dioxide, a gas that is a primary contributor to global warming.

This reliance on fossil fuels has given rise to speculation that bitcoin's energy consumption will continue to rise as it grows in popularity. Glen Brand, director of a Sierra Club chapter in Maine, said in an interview that the growth of virtual currencies such as bitcoin ""threatens progress we are making toward moving toward a low energy, low carbon economy.""

How much does bitcoin really affect energy consumption?

Estimates vary, and a true figure could be impossible to come by because of the intentionally anonymous nature of bitcoin use. But Dutch bitcoin analyst Alex de Vries, who operates a Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index on the website Digiconomist, has produced estimates he believes are alarming.

If bitcoin miners are using the most efficient machines possible, the lowest amount of electricity they could possibly be using is 13 terawatt hours, de Vries said in an interview. That's about as much as the entire country of Slovenia. De Vries said less conservative estimates make it entirely possible that bitcoin is using as much energy as Ireland, which consumes about twice as much as Slovenia, or about 0.7 percent of the U.S. total.

The problem is getting worse, said de Vries, who estimated the annual amount of energy consumed by bitcoin rose by a fifth in the final weeks of 2017.

Who is right in the bitcoin debate?

The extent of bitcoin's impact on the environment, and how much that should matter to people who use it, is a source of debate.

The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index shows that global digital ""mining"" of bitcoin consumes more energy than 159 countries. Nearly 10 U.S. households can be powered for one day by the electricity consumed for a single bitcoin transaction, according to the group, according to Digiconomist.

In other words, it takes a whopping 29.05 TWh (terawatt hours, equal to one million megawatt hours) annually to operate the energy-hungry computers and networks that power bitcoin transactions. That's about 0.13 percent of total global electricity consumption,

While de Vries says bitcoin is consuming an ""insane amount of energy,"" both on its own and relative to older payment systems such as credit cards, others think the situation is now so dire.

Bitcoin investor Marc Bevand, of St. Louis, has written that bitcoin likely uses close to four or five terawatt hours, less than the annual electricity consumption for Christmas lights in the U.S. He said that he believes bitcoin's benefits, such as making payments more efficient and helping people escape inflation, outweigh the environmental toll.

However, he added: ""We don't have exact data to say how much we are benefiting from bitcoin.""",,https://www.information-age.com/decrypting-cryptocurrency-misconceptions-123470182/,"Decrypting cryptocurrency: Top 10 misconceptions keeping people in the dark

Cryptocurrencies have taken the world by storm, but it is a confusing, volatile and often misunderstood area. This article debunks the myths surrounding the phenomenon

The spectacular rise of cryptocurrency is impossible to ignore. Global reaction ricochets from excitement to apprehension to complete incomprehension. In the wake of Bitcoin’s recent surge, governments, investors and laypeople alike are grappling to understand the real potential of cryptocurrency.

Despite the inundation of news and information, it remains, in the eyes of many, a mysterious phenomenon. For many people, the word ‘blockchain’ results in a brain fog and gets mentally filed as gibberish. This lack of general knowledge leads to doubts about the value of cryptocurrency and the technology that supports it.

>See also: Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies surge

Cryptocurrency is widely misunderstood and particularly prone to myths and misconceptions. That said, it is here to stay – so everyone needs to understand its pitfalls and potential. It does offer real advantages over traditional money, but buying and trading cryptocurrencies successfully requires knowledge.

To clear up some of the current confusion, here are some of the top misconceptions about cryptocurrency – debunked.

1. It’s all about Bitcoin

This is definitely not true. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies available, some of which have the potential to rival Bitcoin. In fact, relative newcomers such as Ether and Monero are already proving popular and may provide a real alternative. Another important cryptocurrency to look out for is Litecoin, which has shown impressive growth against Bitcoin since early 2017.

Bitcoin may be the world’s first decentralised cryptocurrency, but it certainly is not the only one making headlines. In many cases, newer cryptocurrencies have been designed specifically to address the perceived limitations and flaws of Bitcoin.

2. Bitcoin transactions are completely anonymous

An anonymous transaction means that the user’s true identity remains unknown. A private transaction doesn’t necessarily shield the user’s identity, but it can hide what was bought and for how much. Bitcoin trades are considered pseudonymous, rather than anonymous.

>See also: 3 ways chatbots can lure people into the world of Bitcoin

The Bitcoin protocol doesn’t record identities, but the blockchain (a distributed electronic public ledger) stores a record of every single transaction and makes them all completely visible.

This anonymity is, on the one hand, very appealing for some users who are concerned with privacy and, on the other, incredibly frustrating for financial institutions. Methods such as transaction graph analysis mean Bitcoin’s transparency can be leveraged to link trades with specific addresses.

3. Cryptocurrency is only used by criminals

Not too long ago, Bitcoin was closely associated with the dark web and criminal transactions. People believed that, thanks to its anonymity, anyone could buy or sell whatever they wanted using Bitcoin and never get caught if they broke the law.

This all changed in February 2015 when the founder of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, was sentenced to life in prison. Silk Road, a marketplace that accepted Bitcoin, facilitated the sale of $1 billion in illegal drugs before being shut down. Since then, more shady characters have been caught and prosecuted for embezzlement, fraud and laundering.

The reality, however, is that most Bitcoin users are law-abiding people who are curious about cryptocurrency, concerned with privacy and hoping to make some money. Yes, digital money can keep illegitimate transactions secret, but many of the most popular cryptocurrency options create a data trail that – with enough forensic intelligence – can reveal an entire financial history and expose the bad guys.

4. Cryptocurrency trading requires technical expertise

The mark of any widely successful technology is that it’s easy to use. If cryptocurrencies were tricky to buy, sell and use, then they wouldn’t be quite so popular.

>See also: The best Bitcoin apps of 2017

That said, embarking on something so completely new can be disconcerting. Fortunately, the ‘wild west’ days of cryptocurrency are settling, and users can now sign up with a safe and secure exchange.

What’s more, educational resources are increasingly available, helping people understand the seemingly incomprehensible world of cryptocurrencies and getting them up to speed quickly.

5. You can only buy a whole coin at a time

You can buy as much, or as little as you want. One Bitcoin, for example, can be divided up into 100,000,000 units. This makes transactions accessible for everyone. You also don’t have to invest your entire savings all at once – or all in one place.

In case you were wondering, each unit of Bitcoin is called a ‘Satoshi’ after the cryptocurrency’s enigmatic creator: Satoshi Nakamoto.

6. It’s too late to invest in cryptocurrency

Given the stratospheric rise in the value of Bitcoin, many would-be investors and traders think they’ve missed the boat. That may well not be the case.

>See also: Will Bitcoin’s record valuation incentivise ransomware attacks?

The World Economic Forum projects that cryptocurrencies will hold 10% of global GDP by 2027. In other words, digital money hasn’t necessarily peaked yet by any means. In fact, its true potential remains to be seen.

7. The government will somehow shut it down

Any desire by governments to shut down Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter, has given way to grudging acceptance. There is no easy way for any institution to reverse or stem this financial revolution. Nonetheless, attempts are being made to regulate the cryptocurrency market.

The world’s governments are taking various positions. For example, South Korea is considering introducing a capital gains tax on cryptocurrency trading, Australia believes the bubble will burst and, in the US, Bitcoin futures have made their world debut on traditional regulated exchanges.

8. There is a huge amount of wealth stored in Bitcoin

There is no doubt that dreams of untold wealth are fuelling much of Bitcoin’s rise – however, Bitcoin’s total market cap is only 2.5% that of gold.

9. Cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value

This does delve into a somewhat lofty territory – one that questions the very philosophical definition of value. If we take Adam Smith’s approach to supply and demand and define market value as simply what someone is willing to pay, then Bitcoin’s extrinsic value is understandably high – it has many willing buyers.

>See also: Bursting the bitcoin bubble: spammers cash in on blockchain euphoria

The source of Bitcoin’s intrinsic value is, perhaps, a little harder to pin down. The intrinsic value of many assets, including gold, depends on their utility. While this applies to Bitcoin too, many cryptocurrency advocates and opponents have not considered the crucial – and very valuable – element of mining.

In theory, anyone can mine Bitcoin, process transactions, create new Bitcoins and get rewarded for it. This ability to profit from Bitcoin outside of trading, combined with its limited supply, gives it even greater value.

10. Bitcoin is just a currency

Yes, you can buy, sell and trade with Bitcoin – but it’s not just a digital form of currency. Bitcoin was the first example of blockchain technology in action. This technology stores data in a public and fully transparent ledger. This accessibility of critical information has the capability to disrupt and transform many different industries for the better.

The incredible rise in the value of Bitcoin this past year has boosted demand – but many remain wary of its volatility. Whether one approaches investment opportunities with a risk-taking attitude or prudence, it pays to know what you’re investing into. Don’t let a lack of knowledge or misguided fears keep you in the dark ages.

While bitcoin jumped more than 1,200 percent last year, Ripple, created by the founder of bitcoin exchange Mt Gox, surged 35,000 percent in the same period.

That means $100 invested in Ripple in January 2017 would have grown to about $35,000 at the start of this year.

To be sure, bitcoin is still the biggest cryptocurrency by far - with market value exceeding $250 billion - and is expected to keep that mantle in the months to come.

Here is a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies - including bitcoin - and how they performed in 2017:

Ripple (XRP):

Launched in 2012, Ripple had a market cap of $91.79 billion as of Tuesday, second after Bitcoin. It is used by companies such as UBS UBSG.S and Santander SAN.MC as payment technology. In November 2017, American Express Co AXP.N also launched an instant blockchain-based payment system using Ripple.

Percentage gain in 2017: About 35,000 percent

Percentage gain in 2017: About 9,300 percent

Trading price as of Wednesday: $1,162.84

Ethereum (ETH):

Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum’s main aim is to operate ‘smart contacts’, instead of acting as a form of money. Smart contracts are scripts of code that can be deployed in Ethereum blockchain.

Percentage gain in 2017: About 9,200 percent

Trading price as of Wednesday: $879.91

Litecoin (LTC):

Introduced in October 2011, Litecoin is very similar to bitcoin. It is number six in terms of market cap, according to coinmarketcap.

The record high comes as bitcoin continues to recover from its Christmas plunge.

Bitcoin rallied over 10% on Tuesday after it was revealed that billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel has put as much as $20 million into the cryptocurrency.



LONDON — The overall value of the global cryptocurrency market surpassed $700 billion on Wednesday to reach a fresh all-time high.

According to data provider Coin Market Cap, the market capitalisation of all combined cryptocurrencies in circulation is now $707 billion, as of around 8.45 a.m. GMT (3.45 a.m. ET) on Wednesday. The market has since dipped and is worth $683 billion at 10.55 a.m. GMT (5.55 a.m. ET) but the record high reached earlier in the day remains significant.

Market capitalisation is a basic valuation metric which multiplies the value of an asset — usually a share in a company — by the amount of that asset in circulation. The total market cap of the crypto market has spiked higher in recent months as many of the more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies in circulation rose.

Mati Greenspan, an analyst at eToro, wrote in his daily crypto roundup on Wednesday: ""There's a distinct buying sentiment among cryptotraders today. The pre-Christmas sell off seems to be well behind us now. Though Bitcoin is still a bit off her all-time highs some of the alts are generating some serious momentum.""

Bitcoin saw its value drop as much as $8,000 in a matter of days over Christmas after a manic rally in December. The biggest and most recognisable cryptocurrency gained strongly on Tuesday after it was revealed by the Wall Street Journal that Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm founded by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, has made hundreds of millions of dollars from bitcoin investments after investing $15-20 million in the asset.

Bitcoin's gains have continued into Wednesday, with the cryptocurrency up by around 1.5% to trade at close to $15,000 per coin, as of 9.55 a.m. GMT (4.55 a.m. ET): While the overall value of cryptocurrencies has increased to a new record, the proportion of that value made up by bitcoin is at an all-time low.

""Bitcoin's market capitalization as a percentage of the total crypto-market hit an all-time low below 36% on Tuesday as smaller so-called alternative cryptocurrencies rallied,"" Business Insider's Frank Chaparro wrote, citing data from Coin Market Cap.

There is increasing evidence that crypto investors are shunning bitcoin in favour of the likes of ethereum and Ripple, two currencies that are vying to be the second largest by market capitalisation.

Ethereum climbed to a record high of more than $880 on Tuesday.",2018-01-03 00:00:00,https://futurism.com/cryptocurrency-future-money-bitcoin,"In a matter of weeks in November 2017, bitcoin surged from a fringe investment to a global sensation. In mid-November, the price was around $3,000 for a single bitcoin; on December 6, 2017, it surpassed $19,000. At the time of publication, the value was hovering around $15,000.

Bitcoin is having a moment — really, it’s had a year. No matter if you think it’s a bubble about to burst, or hope your investments will pay back big in the long run, there is one clear takeaway: Cryptocurrency is changing the future of finance. What’s not yet clear is how the technology behind bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies like it, will alter our national and global financial systems.

Back on the Blockchain

Bitcoin, like all cryptocurrencies, relies on a technology called blockchain that makes its transactions so secure that experts consider them to be virtually unhackable. And because the transactions are assured, the cost of verifying transactions is less than in a central bank though, admittedly, the cost of verifying bitcoin transactions has become fairly expensive.

Cryptocurrency transactions happen directly between individuals instead of through a bank. Every time a person makes a transaction using a cryptocurrency — for example, using funds stored in his or her crypto wallet to send bitcoin to someone else — the transaction is recorded on a digital ledger called a blockchain. Every cryptocurrency has its own blockchain, and computers doing complex math in a large network maintain it.

Once users make a specific number of transactions using a cryptocurrency, the computers group these transactions into a “block.” In order to send a block, adding transactions to the blockchain and winning a monetary reward, a computer has to solve a complex math problem called a cryptographic function.

Basically, the cryptographic equation is throwing a pumpkin (the block) off a building and telling you what the splatter pattern looked like. The only way users can match the splatter pattern — and send the block — is to hurl a bunch of pumpkins off a building themselves. So people who “mine” cryptocurrency are actually just using their computers to smash billions of pumpkins in order to find the winning pumpkin with the right splatter, which validates their block.

In other words, the first computer that can solve a complex math problem gets to add its block of transactions to the blockchain and receive a monetary reward for doing so (this is what people mean by “mining” crypto). Every computer in the network adds the new block to its copy of the digital ledger, and the process continues.

Although bitcoin was created to avoid centralized banking and government money, the technology can be used as a national, centrally banked currency. In fact, the blockchain is so secure that it reduces the cost of verifying transactions, so banks are already looking into it, says David Yermack, chairman of the finance department at New York University’s Stern School of Business. In 50 years, Yermack says, cryptocurrencies could be used as national currencies.

Will Our Future Be In Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was created to work outside national currencies, which is a draw to people who don’t trust central banks, says Yermack.

Those who are hopeful about the rise of bitcoin may have noticed its popularity in countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela, where it is being used as a major means of exchange when government-issued currencies have failed because of hyperinflation. Bitcoin and other means of exchange have become popular in these countries because transactions can be performed on cell phones, and their value is more stable than the hyper-inflated national currency.

But others believe that bitcoin is too riddled with problems to be the cryptocurrency upon which the future is built. First, it likely can’t be used on a national scale because of how few transactions per minute bitcoin supports. Bitcoin’s framework can only make seven transactions per second, says Ari Juels, computer science professor at Cornell University who studies cryptography and computer security. VISA’s credit card network, for comparison, can handle 65,000 transactions per second.

Issues of privacy also stop it from becoming the future of money, says Phillipa Ryan, commercial equity lawyer and lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney. “Bitcoin is problematic in that it provides too much privacy and not enough privacy,” says Juels. “Too much privacy in that it provides enough to give criminals the opportunity to perpetrate a lot of mischief, from ransomware to the Silk Road. Not enough in that transactions are actually traceable by pseudonym.”

Its value also fluctuates too much to provide a stable, functional currency. Unlike traditional currencies, which have a value that is set by the central banking system, the value of bitcoin is driven by speculation about its worth like a stock, says Yermack. So it doesn’t make the cut as a currency. “Traditionally, we think of money as a kind of means of exchange and a store of value,” says Harold James, an economic historian at Princeton. “[Bitcoin] is very good at the means of exchange, but not very good at the store of value.”

The future likely won’t be based on bitcoin. That’s not to say that the future won’t be based on other cryptocurrencies.

If you have a dollar bill, it’s pretty safe to assume it’s worth about a candy bar from day to day. One bitcoin, on the other hand, could be worth a candy bar one day, a car the day after, then next to nothing the day after that. It’s more like a stock than a stable national currency. James says that, based on the historical precedents he studies, bitcoin looks like the highly unstable private currencies created in Eastern Europe after the First World War. When speculation about the value of bitcoin is substantially more than its worth in the real world, bitcoin will burst, like the stock market crashed.

Economists studying cryptocurrency and computer security experts agree: The future likely won’t be based on bitcoin. Of course, that’s not to say that the future won’t be based on other cryptocurrencies.

In the meantime, bitcoin will remain as a grand test of the blockchain technology, says Ryan. Its value will continue to fluctuate, but Ryan is convinced it’s already a bubble. “I think that bubble will burst. It’s fun to watch though, it’s been a great ride,” says Ryan. “When bitcoin finally fails, I think we will look back on it as a really important, valuable experiment in which more lessons will be learned than there will be loss.”

A Shift In The Financial System

Bitcoin offers something groundbreaking, and a growing number of national banks, including the Federal Reserve, are interested in using blockchain technology to power a centralized national currency. Most experts agree that, in the future, countries will turn to cryptocurrency, as money is already moving from the physical to the digital realm. So a method that secures digital transactions is a necessary investment, and the blockchain technology used in cryptocurrencies is a top contender.

“I think the whole idea is probably horrifying to the bitcoin people, but it’s the ultimate harbinger of success when the person you’re trying to defeat co-opts your own plans and turns them against you,” says Yermack. “The ultimate victory is where the central bank co-opts their technology and makes it the basis of their own operation. And I can see it very clearly play out that way,” Yermack says. “Monetary policy and financial stability — I think those problems will be exactly the same in 50 years.” But in 50 years, a nationally backed cryptocurrency could replace the paper dollar, he says.

When it comes to the future of money, cryptocurrency’s influence will be felt in its improved ability to avoid technological problems like hacking, Ryan says. Based on the issues of cybersecurity looming ahead, Ryan thinks that the blockchain will be the technology to transform the money of the future.

Blockchain could make its way into the mainstream in two primary different ways. One option is to switch from physical to digital currency. A dollar would still be a dollar, but transactions would use blockchain to make them more secure. The second way would be to move your bank account from something like CitiBank and transform it into an account in the Federal Reserve itself. If all of a nation’s money were centralized, it would make the Federal Reserve more efficient at its job of stabilizing and regulating the economy, says Christian Catalini, assistant professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management who studies the economics of cryptocurrency.

Some institutions are beginning to try it. Estonia is working to create an e-Residency program, and part of their plan includes launching the estcoin, the world’s first national cryptocurrency. The Bank of England is working to create its own cryptocurrency and has created an experimental cryptocurrency framework called RSCoin that would use a centralized system. To go crypto, the Bank of England would create digital money as if it was printing physical notes. For example, in 2017, there were 73.2 billion British pounds in circulation. A British economy using only cryptocurrency would have the same fixed number of pounds, just represented by a digital “coin” instead of a physical note. Since the value of the British pound is based on how many are in circulation, exchanging a physical note for a digital one has no economic significance — that is, a pound is still a pound, says Yermack. Like bitcoin, RSCoin would use a public ledger and the cryptographic system to distribute money.

In their paper on the RSCoin model, the authors write that a cryptocurrency backed by a national bank should help make cryptocurrency usable on a larger scale, since the central bank could employ other institutions to do the computations to verify transactions. In a model with one central bank and only 30 commercial banks, RSCoin could make 2,000 transactions per second — not quite up to VISA’s speed, but certainly fast enough for British citizens to move about their financial lives quickly and securely.

For a consumer, a centralized cryptocurrency won’t change much, says Catalini. “[Consumers] will just see cheaper prices in the denomination they’re familiar with, and blockchain technology may be used in the background to offer new or better types of financial and payment services.” So with a national cryptocurrency, bank fees would likely drop, and money transfers would happen faster.

And with national cryptocurrencies, it will be more difficult to conduct illegal activity. Even with the anonymous ledgers used today, governments can track users and financial information, says Aniket Kate, a computer scientist at Purdue University. Since all transactions on the blockchain are recorded on every connected computer, it would be difficult to hide financial indiscretions from the government, Kate says.

Over the next fifty years, Yermack thinks that law-abiding citizens, banks, and governments alike could benefit from moving to some form of digital currency. “There is a huge opportunity cost in not making the central bank more efficient,” says Yermack. “I think what you’re really going to need in the long run is a reorganization of the branches of government and probably more levels of political control over the central bank.”

As countries creep closer to creating their own cryptocurrency, they will have to decide just how private they want transactions to be. Bitcoin’s famous openness might not be so appealing for all transactions — you might not like it if your neighbor could see that you’re buying vibrators and cat food in bulk (of course, you could also find all their weird purchases). However, cryptocurrencies can protect user privacy in varying degrees, Kate says; a future system could inhibit your neighbor’s prying eyes.

But the issue of privacy is potentially more of a social problem than a technical one. In Norway, all tax records are public knowledge. In other parts of Scandinavia, electronic banking is also on the public record, says James. Citizens of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greenland, and Iceland rarely use their physical currencies, James says, making those countries a microcosm for a possible future of digital-only currency.

“The only question that seems to be open is: would it be the kind of Scandinavian system we talked about, where every transaction can be monitored [and] that lends itself to a surveillance state?” James asks. “Or will it be a kind of Bitcoin-like system, where there is an anonymity built in?” As countries start to make the switch to digital currencies, their societies, along with the governments themselves and the economies upon which all rely, will have to figure out how to adapt.

Their personal investment perspectives have no impact on editorial content.",2018-01-03 11:45:03,https://cointelegraph.com/news/forks-in-the-road-2017-bitcoin-forks,"2017 has come and gone, shaking up the cryptocurrency world with a swathe of newcomers interspersed with stellar highs and some sobering price corrections.

Bitcoin ended the year having grown over 1,000 percent in value over 12 months. However, that didn’t stop the community forking away from the preeminent currency.

These forks had varying degrees of success, as they looked to solve some of the major shortcomings of the original Bitcoin protocol.

This mainly comes down to the size limit of Bitcoin’s blocks. As it stands, the size of each block on the Bitcoin Blockchain is 1 mb, which limits the amount of transactions processed each second.

Over time, that limit has caused transaction speeds to decline, while payment fees increased as users were forced to pay more to miners to prioritise transactions.

Segregated Witness

The cryptocurrency community as a whole grew increasingly frustrated with the issues plaguing the Bitcoin protocol and different solutions have been proposed over the past two years.

Segregated Witness grabbed headlines in 2017, proposing two-fold changes to the Bitcoin network. The soft-fork, which was activated in August 2017, cuts a Bitcoin transaction data in two, moving the signature or ‘witness’ data to the end of the transaction, effectively reducing the size a transaction takes on a block which speeds up the network.

The second proposed change, which was ditched at the eleventh hour, is known as SegWit2x. This is a hard-fork, which would see block sizes increased from 1 mb to 2 mb to allow a greater number of transactions to be stored on the Blockchain.

Many of the original signatories of the New York Agreement, which comprised of the world’s largest exchanges, miners and wallets, weren’t comfortable with the hard fork coming so soon after SegWit’s activation. That led to the eventual postponement of SegWit2x.

Bitcoin Cash

The decision to drop SegWit2x inevitably caused a rift between two parties. The ‘big blockers’ who were adamant that an increase in block size would further solve scalability, and ‘Core’ who strongly opposed the hard fork solution.

This led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash, which forked away from the original Bitcoin Blockchain on Aug. 1, 2017.

Bitcoin Cash has been the subject of much debate, as the literal fork has been mirrored by unending debates by parties for and against.

The likes of early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver maintains that Bitcoin Cash is the ‘real Bitcoin.’ saying it stays true to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original whitepaper.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin Cash is nearing six months of existence and fears of a pump and dump situation have subsided.

There are clear differences between the two cryptocurrencies, nevertheless it’s support on exchanges like Coinbase prove that the cryptocurrency is growing in popularity - even amid controversy of it’s launch on GDAX in December 2017.

It seems increasingly clear that Bitcoin Cash is here to stay and it’s survival could well end further debate of a proper SegWit2x revival on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

The other forks

Bitcoin Gold champions the cause of the everyday mining enthusiast, who dreams of making a steady income mining cryptocurrency with high powered graphics cards (GPU). As their website states, Bitcoin Gold aims to making ‘Bitcoin mining decentralised again.’

By simply diverging from Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm SHA256 to equihash, individual miners using GPUs can mine Bitcoin Gold easily, with mid-range GPUs. The fork took place in October 2017.

Bitcoin Diamond is another hard fork from the original Bitcoin Blockchain which took place in November 2017. Created by mining pools Team EVEY and Team 007, BCD will have a total of 210 mln tokens, 10 times as many as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin Diamond mining uses the X13 hashing algorithm, which favors mining using GPUs much like Bitcoin Gold, opposing ASIC miners needed to mine Bitcoin, which are expensive.

Trash?

Almost tongue in cheek, Chinese Blockchain investor Chandler Guo announced the launch of Bitcoin God in December. Claiming charitable intentions, holders of Bitcoin would receive their holding of 17 mln tokes, while the remaining four mln tokes of the 21 mln cap would be donated to charity, according the the website. It was ironically due to fork on Dec. 25, 2017 - Christmas Day. We’re taking this one with a pinch of salt.

Another intriguing, albeit sketchy fork is the so-called revival of SegWit2x. A completely new set of developers have reworked the original SegWit2x code, and the hard fork was announced on Dec. 28.

The group have admitted that they have no affiliation to the original developers, and the new fork has made some outlandish promises to supporters of the fork. As this writer reported, the project seems far-fetched and it’s progress will be monitored with skeptical eyes over the next couple of weeks.

The list goes on

While we’ve narrowed our focus to the four major Bitcoin forks of 2017, namely Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond and Bitcoin God, there are many more hard forks to mention.

The list is extensive, including Bitcoin Clashic, Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hot, Bitcoin X, Oil Bitcoin, Bitcoin World, Lightning Bitcoin. There are more, with at least 14 forks in December 2017.

It’s hard to believe that many of these forks will survive or provide any real value to the wider cryptocurrency community. However, the discourse and ideas generated by developers looking to improve cryptocurrency protocols will inevitably benefit the community and drive the evolution of Blockchain technology into the future.",,https://www.coindesk.com/rsk-beta-brings-ethereum-style-smart-contracts-closer-bitcoin,"RSK is launching its bitcoin smart contracts platform in beta today.

Formerly known as Rootstock, the startup has long been lauded for its potential to pave the way for the implementation of ethereum-style smart contracts on bitcoin, something enthusiasts believe will keep the world’s largest cryptocurrency competitive with the platform that arguably pioneered the idea that more complex self-executing code could be run on a blockchain.

But while it would be easy enough for bitcoin users that want more complex smart contracts to merely make the switch, some users believe that, as bitcoin is the largest and most secure cryptocurrency, more experimental features that debut on other networks will eventually make their way to its network. The idea is that in doing so, they can capitalize on bitcoin’s impressive startup infrastructure and serve different users.

Yet, RSK’s version of the functionality doesn’t quite upgrade the bitcoin blockchain itself. The capability will rather be brought to bitcoin via a sidechain, which moves tokens from the main bitcoin blockchain to a compatible network operated with the help of 25 companies.

Still, RSK CEO Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar believes the advance will effectively provide the same level of utility to potential users.

He told CoinDesk:

“This is the first time that there’s going to be a smart contract platform powered by the bitcoin network.”

Like ethereum’s implementation, RSK’s sidechain will use a Turing-complete language and issue blocks roughly every 10 seconds.

A controlled sidechain

In this way, RSK’s “federated” sidechain is also a notable workaround to the difficult process of changing bitcoin’s code (most recently seen during bitcoin’s scaling debates).

But that difficulty comes because one small change can have technical repercussions on other parts of the system, so much so, that changing a blockchain’s rules is often compared to tearing out and repairing the engine of an airplane while it’s flying. Because of this, developers have long sought to make it easier to use more experimental technologies on bitcoin with so-called “sidechains,” which pin newer blockchains with innovative technical features to bitcoin.

Users can then test and try these new features by moving money onto the sidechain.

Yet, because merge-mined sidechains, at a technical level, are not ready for primetime, RSK developers are relying on a group of companies – known as a “federation” – who collectively control the money put into the sidechain (the original dream of sidechains is moving money back and forth between the main bitcoin network and the sidechain without trusting anyone).

RSK developers and business partners have been running experimental smart contracts on the testnet for some time. And currently, they are the only ones who can access the so-called “smart bitcoin” (SBTC) needed to run smart contracts on the sidechain.

According to RSK co-founder Gabriel Kurman, this is for security purposes.

“The network will still have limited access until we finalize the onboarding on most of the bitcoin miners and federation members,” he said.

And adding to that, RSK head of business development Henry Sraigman, said, “We expect to open the access to the general public as soon as we complete the onboarding of the RSK Federation members and we add more hashing power to the network in the coming weeks.”

Continuing interest

That said, the mainnet launch is still a big step for bitcoin and one that many in the community will likely greet with enthusiasm.

In addition to the 25 companies that are part of RSK’s federation, Zaldivar said that bitcoin’s miners have “expressed interest” in being involved. More than half, he claims, are working with RSK right now.

“The idea is to start on the mainnet, strengthening the security of the platform, and hopefully by May, we can announce the production version of the mainnet,” he said.

According to RSK executives, they’re hoping the company’s previously-announced bug bounty program, which rewards developers in cash prizes of up to $5000, could be a part of driving better security on the platform. And as an open-source project, a “global community” will be able to vet and test the platform.

And while no one knows how long it will take for trustless sidechains to be implemented on bitcoin, Zaldivar, for one, is optimistic, telling CoinDesk:

“It’s already solved. We hope to have it by 2018 – the sooner the better – but, as everything in bitcoin, security should be first.”

If you missed out as the virtual currency soared from $1,000 to over $19,000, here are five other digital assets you can jump into with your holiday cash and try to ride the next wave...or lose it all in the next crash.

Several alternative currencies have also seen significant movement in the past year, rising anywhere from 600 to 37,000 percent. But before you buy, do your research.

The first thing to remember is that you can buy a fractional piece of almost any cryptocoin for just a few bucks — no need to shell out thousands of dollars for a full bitcoin, for example.

Some digital assets are designed to be actual currencies for conducting transactions. Others are ""tokens"" issued by specific companies as a way to raise money. The value of the token may rise or fall based on how well their product is doing... or they may just get bought up in a speculative spree.

""The same rules apply for speculating in cryptocurrencies and tokens as every other investment class,"" said Nick Colas at DataTrek Research, an analyst who's been covering cryptocurrency for over four years. ""You have to know who is in charge, what problems the product is supposed to solve, what competition exists,"" and why anyone would want to use the underlying product.

Can't answer those questions? Does the idea of seeing your nest egg swing up and down double-digit points within a few hours give you indigestion? Then maybe stick to low-fee index funds. Otherwise, buckle in. Prices and percentages are rounded.

Ripple (token)

Jan. 1, 2017 close: Less than one cent

Jan. 1, 2018 close: $2.40

Rise: 37,400 percent

Ripple is designed to be a cheaper, faster, and more direct way to send money around the world. That has led to some big banks testing it out. But after hovering below a dollar for a months, the price suddenly shot up in late 2017 on the back of a South Korean word-of-mouth buying surge. Now it's in the top 10 of all cryptocoins by market capitalization.

IOTA (token)

June 13, 2017 close: $0.60 (launched in June)

Jan. 1, 2018 close: $4.00

Rise: 570 percent

We've heard about how ""Internet of Things"" devices will one day talk to each other. But how about if they also pay each other? ""One day, when your fridge orders more milk, it may pay with IOTA,"" said Colas. The bulk of the token's jump occurred in November when the company announced it was starting a data marketplace with 35 participating companies, including Microsoft and Samsung.

Monero (coin)

Jan. 1, 2017 close: $14

Jan. 1, 2018 close: $360

Rise: 2,470 percent

It's like bitcoin, except even more anonymous. That's made it the new coin of the realm for technophiles and dark web transactions.

Vertcoin (coin)

Jan. 1, 2017 price: $0.03

Jan. 1, 2018 price: $6.80

Rise: 22,500 percent

One of the criticisms of bitcoin is that it's supposed to be deregulated and decentralized. But ""minting"" or ""mining"" more bitcoins requires using increasingly faster and more expensive computers to solve more complex math problems. That puts more power in the hands of those who have the time and money to run the mining systems, especially specialized machines whose sole purpose is mining. Vertcoin is a tweaked version of bitcoin that its developers say is ""resistant"" to being exploited by some of these systems. That's drawn fans on the social link sharing site Reddit, and soaring popularity over the last year.

CryptoKitty (application)

True to the nature of the internet that birthed them, these speculative products are a little quirky. Case in point, ""CryptoKitties,"" which are not tokens or cryptocurrencies themselves but a special kind of digital app that uses Ethereum, another cryptocurrency that was hot in 2017. They're sort of like Tamagotchis (remember those?) except you can breed them and create offspring that share qualities of both parents. Whether you think that's fun or frivolous, there's real money in the virtual toy. Over 10 of these digital felines have sold for over $100,000.

""This whole area is the Wild West,"" Colas told NBC News. ""Many ICOs make the 1990s dot com boom stocks look like Blue Chip securities.""",2018-01-03 20:26:00+00:00,https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/03/technology/bitcoin-popularity-criminals-monero/index.html,"Bitcoin is becoming too hot for criminals so they're switching to more obscure cryptocurrencies such as monero, according to European law enforcement officials.

Just as bitcoin has skyrocketed in value and popularity, so has the attention given to the digital currency by law enforcement agencies, making it a less attractive method of payment in the criminal world.

Europe's top law enforcement official -- Europol executive director Rob Wainwright -- tweeted Tuesday that there will be a ""progressive shift in 2018 towards criminal use of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin.""

That shift makes it ""more challenging for law enforcement to counter,"" he added.

Experts say bitcoin is becoming too mainstream, and therefore too risky, for criminals.

""The fact that bitcoin is constantly in the spotlight makes it more valuable for investors, but certainly less valuable for its earliest fans -- criminals -- giving rise to interest in other alternative cryptos designed to avoid tracking,"" said Daniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School.

The number of cases where criminals have been identified through bitcoin tracing is increasing, according to Europol. Companies such as Elliptic and Chainalysis specialize in tracking bitcoin transactions, linking them to companies and individuals, and they work closely with law enforcement agencies.

Bitcoin may be challenging to track, but each transaction provides investigators with information that can lead them to the IP addresses of the computers sending and receiving the payment, the amount of bitcoins transferred and a timestamp, according to a Europol spokesperson.

That could be enough to identify those behind the transactions.

""This is, however, not true for some cryptocurrencies, which purposefully make the transactions hidden,"" the spokesperson added.

Europol highlighted several cryptocurrencies it says are growing in popularity among criminals: monero, ethereum, dash and zcash.

According to Europol data, bitcoin used to account for roughly 90% of the cryptocurrency market until 2016. It now stands at 36%.

Monero, which was launched in 2014, offers even higher levels of privacy than bitcoin. Its technology makes it impossible to attribute transactions to any particular user or IP address.

Europol said monero is being accepted on several darkweb markets and has already been used in a ransomware attack.

Monero is currently trading at around $400 a piece. It was worth just $16 a year ago.

Bianchi explained that monero units are indistinguishable from one another, meaning that every unit of the currency can be substituted by another.

""This makes monero different from public-ledger cryptocurrencies, where [IP] addresses previously associated with undesired activity can be blacklisted and refused by network members,"" he added.",2018-01-03 00:00:00,https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/03/look-out-bitcoin-here-come-cardano-and-stellar.aspx,"Bitcoin is having a quiet day Wednesday, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the cryptocurrency landscape. Three hot digital currencies -- Ripple and lesser-known Cardano and Stellar -- are surging today on major investor interest. Here are the latest cryptocurrency prices and how much each has changed recently.

Today's cryptocurrency prices -- Wednesday, Jan. 3, 2018

Here's a look at the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and how much each has changed over the past day as well as over the past week.

Cryptocurrency Name (Code) Price in U.S. Dollars Day's Change 7-Day Change Bitcoin (BTC) $14,795 (1.6%) (3.8%) Ripple (XRP) $2.78 27.4% 130.8% Ethereum (ETH) $919.77 8.3% 19.1% Bitcoin Cash (BCH) $2,550.00 (2.1%) (8%) Cardano (ADA) $1.04 36.5% 155.1% Stellar (XLM) $0.89 58.8% 301.7% Litecoin (LTC) $245.10 (3.2%) (10.3%)

There have been several big cryptocurrency moves in just the past 24 hours, but none involving bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, or litecoin. After rising yesterday on news that Peter Thiel has invested millions in the leading digital currency, bitcoin has been relatively flat, but Ripple has achieved another all-time high, and now has a market cap equal to roughly half of bitcoin.

Additionally, Cardano and Stellar jumped by 37% and 59%, respectively, pushing litecoin, which was once a top alternative digital currency, all the way down to the number seven position. These two lesser-known currencies have been on fire lately, as they aim to solve some of the obstacles to bitcoin being used on a large scale as a money-transfer mechanism.

Cardano has surged to a market value of nearly $30 billion thanks to investor interest in its scalable and uniquely secure blockchain network. And Stellar, like Ripple, has become the subject of investor interest for its high-profile corporate partnerships.

Stellar catapults over litecoin

Stellar has been the best-performing cryptocurrency of 2018, with a gain of roughly 150% through the first three days of the year, including nearly 60% in the past day. The lesser-known currency has catapulted over litecoin to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap as of this writing, with a total market value of about $16.4 billion.

Stellar was originally based on Ripple's protocol (both companies have the same founder, Jed McCaleb), but was later completely redone. And to be clear, Stellar is the name of the protocol. Its currency is officially called the lumen, with symbol XLM. And like Ripple, the main reason for the surge in interest in the currency is that it has shown real-world traction toward becoming a widely used payment medium.

Most notably, IBM is partnering with Stellar to develop a rapid, international payments system. Like Ripple, Stellar solves some of the key problems facing bitcoin, especially rising transaction fees and long transaction times, both of which have become worse as bitcoin has surged in popularity.",2018-01-03 00:00:00,,,

This day might be remembered in the history books as a major milestone for cryptocurrency diversification or as another colossal indicator of the altcoin bubble. There are now three cryptocurrencies with over a $100 billion market cap each. Bitcoin, ethereum (ETH) and ripple (XRP) are worth today a combined total of about half a trillion USD.

$100 Billion Club

Ethereum long term investors and short term speculators are celebrating alike today as the smart contracts altcoin has broken through the $1,000 per coin psychological barrier. Standing at about $1,040 at the time of writing, the overall value of all ETH in circulation is now over $100 billion. It is the third cryptocurrency in this exclusive club, behind only bitcoin and ripple.

And despite all the warnings about ripple being centralized and freezable speculators keep pouring in to XRP. After rising about 160% from just a week ago and 28% in the last 24 hours alone, its market cap is now well over $140 billion. With a price of just under $4 per coin, part of this movement has to be due to penny stock mentality of new traders seeking a “cheap bitcoin” to bet on.

Altogether, with bitcoin over $250 billion market cap, the three top cryptocurrencies are now worth just shy of $500 billion. Putting this mind boggling number into perspective, its just about 10% below the combined stock value of Visa (NYSE:V $265 billion), Mastercard (NYSE: MA $166 billion), American (NYSE: AXP $87 billion), and Discover (NYSE: DFS $28 billion).

Entering a Multi-Polar World?

Bitcoin has been able to maintain an impressive price level at $15,000 and a quarter trillion USD market cap in the face of this altcoin onslaught, but its market share has suffered. The BTC Dominance Index is now just above 32%, a new all time low, which means that bitcoin is for first time worth less than a third of the crypto market.

While some of ripple’s staunch supporters, as well as fans that heard about it a week ago, are cheering on for “The Rippening” maybe its time to forget about the term and any other Flippening. It is possible that we are simply seeing a paradigm shift in the market, from one leading cryptocurrency and a thousand copy cats to a top heavy, multi-polar landscape. This can probably only be validated in the next big correction, when all the short term speculators will scatter away and either bitcoin will remain alone at the top or not.

Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, rallied 1,900 percent last year. But, as prices neared the $20,000 mark in December, the relatively cheap “small cap” coins began to rise. With gains due, in part at least, to the rotation of money out of an overbought bitcoin, the broader cryptocurrency rally seems to have gathered pace in 2018.

With 66 percent appreciation so far in 2018, Ripple’s XRP token is now the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That’s impressive, yet XRP still ranks sixth on the list of top gainers so far this year, among those ranked in the top 25 by total value, as of 18:00 UTC.

So which “large-cap” cryptocurrencies are leading the pack?

Top 10 cryptocurrencies of 2018 by percentage gained

Overall, the TRON token tops the table with 270 percent gains since Jan. 1. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 100 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap, and its market cap has tripled this week to $10 billion.

In second place is the status network token (SNT) – an ethereum-based cryptocurrency that has gained more than 160 percent in value this year and is up 700 percent month-on-month. Stellar, which topped the list two days ago, has slipped to number three. It is now the seventh largest currency with a market cap of $9.97 billion.

And although at a record high of over $1,000 today, ethereum’s native token ether (up 28 percent this year) sits at the bottom of the table in 10th place.

Interestingly, bitcoin ranks as low as 18 (up 2 percent this year), as prices have traded roughly sideways since the fall from its December all-time high.

Many promoters of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other cryptocurrency investments are not following federal and state securities laws, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commissioners Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said in a statement. While regulators are trying to police these quickly growing markets, the SEC urged investors to be vigilant.

“The SEC and state securities regulators are pursuing violations, but we again caution you that, if you lose money, there is a substantial risk that our efforts will not result in a recovery of your investment,” the officials said.",2018-01-04 16:57:09+00:00,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-safe-way-to-bet-on-blockchain-amid-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-craze/,"It's been almost a decade since bitcoin and its underlying blockchain distributed ledger technology were born, planting the seed for the cryptocurrency mania that began in 2017. Blockchain allows for transactions to be recorded without a central trusted authority. Any process that involves many parties and middlemen could potentially be made more efficient. Payments is what bitcoin aims to solve, but that's just one of many possible applications.

Like any exciting technology, the hype is probably out ahead of what blockchain can realistically accomplish. Who could have guessed that there would be a mania around a type of database? But here we are, with wild swings in the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on an almost daily basis.

How to bet on blockchain

There are two main ways to bet on blockchain. You could buy cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin or ethereum. The value of bitcoin shot up in 2017 from about $1,000 to over $13,000. Ethereum rocketed from less than $10 to over $700. This strategy certainly worked last year.

But by buying cryptocurrencies, you're not betting on blockchain itself. Instead, you're betting on a specific application of blockchain. For your investment to work out in the long run -- and I use the term investment loosely here because cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value -- you must be right about blockchain living up to the hype and about cryptocurrency someday becoming useful for anything other than speculation. Blockchain can succeed, becoming a widely used technology in a variety of applications, and these cryptocurrencies could still be worth nothing.

The second way to bet on blockchain is by investing in companies using the technology. You need to tread carefully here. A number of companies in the past few months have goosed their shares by announcing blockchain initiatives or simply changing their names. These so-called ""bitcoin stocks,"" like Riot Blockchain and Xunlei Limited, have ridden the speculative cryptocurrency frenzy to massive gains. One look at the fundamentals, however, should be enough to convince you to stay away.

Investing in a company using blockchain is a better option than buying cryptocurrency, but you need to pick the right company. Blockchain may not turn out to be a transformative technology. It's been nearly 10 years, after all, and there's still not a clear-cut case of blockchain proving to be a dramatically better option than the status quo. If you invest in a company going all-in on blockchain, you're exposing yourself to the risk of near-total loss.

That's why International Business Machines (IBM) the century-old technology company, is the safest way to bet on blockchain. If blockchain lives up to the hype, investors benefit from IBM's various blockchain initiatives. If it doesn't, IBM's other bets, like cloud computing and artificial intelligence, can still drive growth, and its various legacy businesses can still produce exceptional profits. You'd be giving up the explosive upside of the other options, but also the ruinous downside.

The leading blockchain company

IBM has worked with over 400 clients to implement blockchain applications. Notable examples include a deal with seven major European banks to build a blockchain-based platform for trade finance, a collaboration with shipping giant Maersk to use blockchain to make the transport and logistics industries more efficient, and a partnership with global food companies including Kroger and Unilever to explore the use of blockchain for tracking the global food supply chain.

At this point, given that many of these efforts are still in their early stages, blockchain is probably not producing a huge amount of revenue for IBM, at least not directly. Speaking to Bloomberg, VP of technology for IBM Blockchain Jerry Cuomo pointed out some indirect benefits: ""Our sales team loves blockchain because a customer that is buying blockchain rarely walks out of the store with just blockchain. They walk out with multiple things in their cart.""

IBM's vast base of existing customers, which includes 97% of the world's largest banks, 83% of the world's largest communications service providers, and 80% of global retailers, gives the company a key advantage. IBM can leverage these relationships, some decades-long, to sell new technologies like blockchain.

Even if blockchain turns out to be a dud, a footnote in tech history rather than a revolution, IBM has other avenues for growth. The company's cloud business is at a $15.8 billion annual revenue run rate, growing by 25% year over year during the third quarter. IBM's ""strategic imperatives,"" the name the company uses for its growth business, accounted for 45% of total revenue over the past 12 months, growing at a double-digit rate.

On top of that, IBM may be the cheapest blockchain stock available. The company expects to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted earnings for 2017, putting the price-to-earnings ratio barely above 11. The S&P 500, for comparison, trades for nearly 26 times trailing-12-month earnings. And let's not forget about IBM's 3.9% dividend yield and its 22-year history of raising that dividend.

Buying into a mania is a road to ruin. The only safe way to bet on blockchain is to invest in a company that is not entirely dependent on the technology succeeding. IBM fits the bill, exposing investors to some upside if its blockchain business takes off, but little downside if it doesn't. Buying IBM stock won't be as exciting as watching the price of bitcoin careen up and down, but long-term investing isn't supposed to be a thrill ride.

This article originally appeared on the investing website The Motley Fool. Full disclosure: The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned, but author Timothy Green owns shares of IBM.",,https://qz.com/1171977/ten-2018-predictions-from-the-founder-of-the-blockchain-research-institute/,"A year ago, Alex Tapscott (my co-author of Blockchain Revolution) and I made some predictions for 2017. At the end of the year we compared those predictions to what had actually occurred. Overall they stood up well.

Notably we said: “Bitcoin will hit $2,000 (that’s right: one bitcoin will be worth $2,000). Ethereum will not collapse, post-DAO, but will become a dominant platform for new apps and new business models.”

We were ridiculed by some for forecasting that bitcoin would nearly triple in value. “You guys are nuts,” was a popular tweet. Of course, only in the wild world of cryptocurrencies can you set a one-year price target implying a near 200% return, and miss the mark by a factor of nearly 10! As for ethereum, the fork happened and ethereum kept on chugging away, became the de-facto platform for the ICO (initial coin offering) boom that launched a thousand Dapps (distributed applications), from distributed file storage and prediction markets to collectible kittens.

2017 was a year when cryptocurrency markets dominated the public imagination. While some of us grew excited by the explosion of new applications, platforms and technologies being launched, many others were simply happy to ride the wave of higher prices. Indeed, the value of these assets grew from $15 billion to $500 billion, one of the great bull markets of our time.

Is this justified? Valuations today reflect tomorrow’s value—and tomorrow’s value could be significant and revolutionary. So, taking the market as a whole as the best representation for the future value of blockchain technology, today’s value could be argued to be conservative. However, it’s hard to look at the dizzying price escalation of virtually every cryptoasset, and the euphoria driving the market ever higher, and not feel some vertigo-inducing skepticism.

Consider that at the outset of 2016, only one cryptoasset (bitcoin) had a value of more than $1 billion. Today, the number stands at 36. The number of newly minted crypto-unicorns ought to make even the biggest bull blush. And it goes without saying that in all likelihood, many, if not most, of these new currencies, protocols and applications will fail. But emerging from this Cambrian explosion of innovation will be the foundational technologies for the new internet of value.

Still, what truly has been achieved?

As Vitalik Buterin, creator of ethereum, eloquently asked:

“How many unbanked people have we banked? How much censorship-resistant commerce for the common people have we enabled? How many Dapps [distributed applications] have we created that have substantial usage? How much value is stored in smart contracts that actually do anything interesting? How many Venezuelans have actually been protected by us from hyperinflation? How much actual usage of micropayment channels is there actually in reality?”

Buterin pointed out that the level of activity is positive, but not significant enough to warrant the $0.5 trillion figure (Now more than $650 billion). “The answer to all of these questions is definitely not zero, and in some cases, it’s quite significant. But not enough to say it’s $0.5T levels of significant. Not enough.”

On the one hand, ICOs have changed the world of venture capital. On the other hand, few if any recently financed distributed applications are running commercially and at scale (i.e. they don’t work…yet). On the one hand, bitcoin has seen massive adoption and a huge run-up in prices, leading to institutional buy-in, mass-market appeal and a futures market. On the other hand, vexing questions around scaling and governance remain fully or partially unanswered.

Regulatory uncertainty surrounds bitcoin as it moves from fringe curiosity to a legitimate threat to central-bank-issued fiat currencies (as a store of value, if not yet as a medium of exchange).

Ethereum has emerged as the first general-purpose platform for building distributed applications. Yet, a glut in ICO activity or even a spike in the trading of crypto-kitties can slow down or stall the network, as it did in December.

So, despite the awesome potential, blockchain is a long way off from changing the world.

2018 will be the year where the tremendous innovation and promise of blockchain must become real. Otherwise, the market is in for a rude awakening. And maybe that’s not the worst thing in the world. As Chris Burniske, a partner at crypto-fund Placeholder Ventures, said “A strong #crypto bear market in 2018 would sharpen all of us.” In the spirit of staying sharp (and sharpening our pencils) Here are some predictions:

1. The value of cryptocurrencies continues to grow

We still remain positive on the market as a whole. Forget about a massive and permanent crash. Cryptoassets will be volatile, and there will be melt-downs, but expect an overall increase in value, as long as innovation in functionality continues.

We are still in the early stage. Oddly, bitcoin’s meteoric price rise makes it easier and not harder for new investors to justify stepping in as it is now a large asset class too big to ignore. 2018 will see widespread institutional buying of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but buyers beware—for bitcoin to sustain its rally, scaling solutions must work in the real world, and critical governance challenges must be resolved.

We will see a flood of institutional, retail and family office money entering the market. Many people and organizations have not invested because of custodial reasons—they’re either unable or unwilling to hold private keys. They should probably learn to do that, but nonetheless this problem is being addressed. Coinbase has vaults where they store crypto assets. There are new onramps being created, such as funds and futures trading offered by traditional financial services companies.

But over the next years, most of the cryptocurrencies on the top 10 will be superseded by platforms that have more powerful functionality just as many of the hot tech stocks of the dotcom era were superseded by new and powerful companies like, Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

2. The cryptocurrency craze broadens to embrace blockchain business transformations

At the Blockchain Research Institute, we’re investigating the ways blockchain promises to transform 10 major industries: financial services, retail and consumer goods, government and democracy, energy, higher education, transportation, manufacturing, media and telecommunications, technology, healthcare, and resources. In all these industries we already see striking innovations piloted by massive organizations. Supply chains are a $60 trillion industry containing juggernauts like Foxconn and Walmart—both who are digging into blockchain for transformative implementations. As Tom Serres and Bettina Warburg point out in one of our projects, supply chains are poised to become cognitive machines with a “network state,” enriched with knowledge, and imbued with “machine trust.”

Meanwhile, many of the best new startups are architected on decentralized models. This is the equivalent of the dotcom rush of mid- to late-1990s. Many dotcoms failed, as is typical of a wave of technological innovation. But today many are dominant players in the modern digital economy. As with the dotcoms, expect many “Blockcoms” to fail.

3. The new platform for value creation emerges

Bitcoin is still just a currency and a store of value. Think of it as the first big app of the Internet of Value, like email was the first big app of its predecessor, the Internet of Information. But what will be the equivalent of the World Wide Web—the general-purpose platform for application development?

Watch for ethereum to continue to grow, not just in value but in the number of game-changing Dapps built on it. In 2018, it will move from proof of work to proof of stake. But will ethereum be the platform for the next generation of distributed applications? Will it be one of the core protocols of the new Internet of Value, or will something else take its place? It’s currently the best candidate for a “Flippening,” and there is massive work underway to expand its capability, including Casper and Sharding upgrades and a shift to proof of stake.

New platforms to watch in 2018 include Cosmos, Aion, ICON, and Polkadot—all of which could help address critical issues of scalability, interoperability and governance. These new platforms are different than their predecessors as they have been designed from the outset to overcome many of the existing bottlenecks. These so-called “third generation blockchains” are unique in that they aim to achieve all of the following: smart-contract functionality, interoperability, scalability, customization, and the ability to be both multi-asset and multi-industry. Whether they succeed is a big question we seek to see answered in 2018.

4. The $10 billion ICO, as ICOs shift towards equity tokens

In 2017, ICOs raised funds for utility tokens. But by the end of the year, fatigue had set in. Most token acquisitions were driven by the prospect of short-term speculative gain. But the promise of ICOs is not to enable speculation but to enable the funding of innovation.

In 2018, there will be plenty of opportunities for new ICOs—high-function currencies that build on pioneering work in anonymity, scale and fungibility, product tokens, loyalty tokens, or social tokens like carbon credits—where the tokens represent something of value other than a stake of ownership in a company. Still nascent, but likely to explode in value, are security tokens—cryptoassets that represent financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and futures contracts.

Consider the possibility of a $10 billion ICO from Tesla. Here’s a thought experiment: There are at least 10 million Tesla fans in the world who can’t buy a Tesla (because they live in places like Nigeria, Pakistan where one can’t purchase a Tesla or else they don’t have enough money). But they’d love to be part of the community and have a stake in the future of the company, and could easily put up $1,000 for a Model-3 Coin, or TeslaToken of some kind. So, using an ICO, Tesla could raise $10 mil x 1,000 = $10 billion—more than they could ever raise on the stock exchange or in the bond markets. This smart security could simply represent simple ownership in a new product, or in the company itself, or it could be programmed to include other functionality, for example a carbon offset to entice individuals to reduce their footprint.

5. Cracks in the walls of digital feudalism

Under the feudal system, landlords owned vast amounts of land. Serfs worked the land to create value but had most of the value confiscated by the landlord. Today the new asset class is data—created by us but captured by our digital landlords (social media companies, search engines, governments, banks, etc.). We need to recover this data—our “digital identity”—and manage it responsibly in our own interests.

With blockchain, people (along with physical and digital objects) can possess unique, immutable identities in a “digital black box.” It will capture data that we can each monetize, use to plan our lives and protect our privacy. Such blockchain identities are underway from multiple sources. In 2018 keep an eye on technology companies like uPort from ConsenSys, Civic, or Sovrin, to provide individuals with authority and autonomy over their identity. Some or the best innovations will be bottom-up, as institutions from hospitals and universities build blockchain identities for their constituents. We will also see the emergence of a new class of “data aggregators.” They will negotiate with individuals and organizations to acquire access to their data.

6. The digital conglomerates wade in

Over a decade ago my company coined the term “Digital Conglomerates” to refer to a new species of business. Companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet have based their enormous success on centralized models and the capture of data.

This is a repeat of 1994. Despite the dotcom crash of 2001 the internet is more talked about today—positively and critically—than an any previous time.

There’s no doubt that blockchain technology poses an existential threat to the world’s largest digital conglomerates. But in the coming year, we will see these companies embrace crypto-currencies, and even many of the other applications of blockchain technology. Get ready for the Empire to Strike Back.

On Dec. 12, 2017, it was announced that David Marcus, the head of Messenger at Facebook, would join Coinbase’s board. I have no doubt Facebook is exploring cryptocurrency payments within the Facebook Messenger platform or some other token-related initiative. We may even see an acquisition attempt by Facebook.

That would surely not be the only acquisition of a blockchain company by a major digital conglomerate. Google is already this year’s second-largest investor in blockchain technologies, and we can expect that to continue as public interest in blockchain explodes.

Meanwhile, in Dec. 2017, Amazon announced a partnership with R3 to allow its platform Corda to become one of the first-ever distributed ledger technologies on Amazon Web Services. Is this a sign of things to come for Amazon, who stand to lose tremendously to blockchain-based retailers? Absolutely.

7. The implementation of fiat cryptocurrencies (finally)

Dating back to Bank of England Mark Carney’s famous 2016 Mansion House speech, governments everywhere have been exploring the use of blockchain to supercharge their fiat currencies. Not to be hyperbolic, but I think this decision may prove as consequential as the Bretton Woods consensus to move to a US dollar reserve currency. It could profoundly shape the next 100 years of human prosperity.

2017 brought some interesting developments with China, Russia, Dubai, and Venezuela (and some other countries that are not exactly pillars of democracy) leading the way. Many so-called fiat cryptocurrencies are nothing of the kind, but rather attempts by governments to appear innovative and undermine independent cryptocurrencies. In 2018 expect real initiatives to move forward with countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, Canada, India, Estonia, South Korea, Japan, and the UK.

Meanwhile, expect that bitcoin and other actual cryptocurrencies to deepen their utility as a real medium of exchange. There are thousands of large- or medium-sized companies that accept bitcoin for payment of goods and services. There are marquis organizations like Overstock.com, Newegg, Shopify.com, Dish Network, and even Microsoft and Paypal. For many, 2017 was a good year. They didn’t convert their bitcoins to fiat currencies and benefited from the bitcoin value explosion.

Evidence suggests that in 2018 that a growing number of larger retailers and service providers will accept bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general) as payment. This could include previously mentioned Facebook and Amazon.

8. Regulation fever—the good, the bad, and the ugly

In 2017, blockchain and cryptocurrencies became too big to ignore. In 2018, they will become too big to fail. Many regulators will be more assertive. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Some short-sighted governments, namely China, have curtailed or banned digital currencies, and risk relegating their economies to the backwater of innovation and growth.

This new Internet of Value raises a public interest, and changes many industries and institutions. Sensible regulation can be helpful. In many areas, such as the highly speculative world of ICOs, where entrepreneurs have raised more than $3 billion by issuing digital tokens, regulation is urgently needed. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is on the right track. Since July and in a number of separate communiques, it has struck a balanced tone, arguing that some, but not all, cryptoassets, are securities. Underpinning this red-hot market is a profound technological innovation. While SEC Chairman Jay Clayton urged “extreme caution” for investors, he also said, “I believe that initial coin offerings—whether they represent offerings of securities or not—can be effective ways for entrepreneurs and others to raise funding, including for innovative projects.”

While there is still much to do, I applaud the SEC’s efforts to understand and address this new market. Securities regulation is one of a dozen areas from tax policy to intellectual property where there is a public interest and regulators need to be cautious but open-minded.

9. The social impact—breakthroughs on energy and climate change

There are many use-cases poised for big growth in 2018. However, the killer app for blockchain may be saving the planet, literally. It’s time for deployment of distributed energy and peer-to-peer trading of energy tokens generated from sustainable sources—including off the grid. In November, I gave the opening speech at global electrical energy conference BIXPO 2017 in Gwangju, Korea and was amazed at blockchain initiatives by Korean power utility Kepko. Companies such as Spectral Energy in the Netherlands and LO3 Energy and Grid+ in the US are leading the way.

Blockchain and smart contracts will enable new enterprises to engage everyone in living more sustainably. Tokenized carbon credits will be transacted through smart contracts at marketplaces like Veridium. I see companies like CarbonX Personal Carbon Trading and Zerofootprint Software enabling and rewarding individuals to manage their personal carbon footprint. And I see enterprises balancing excess carbon emissions throughout their supply chains to create carbon neutrality in the manufacturing of products and services.

10. A year of growing crypto resilience

There will be hacks—in exchanges, wallets and applications—but overall blockchain and crypto robustness will grow. Call them “resilience technologies.” They have an anti-fragility model, increasing capability and robustness as a convex response to attacks, shocks, stressors, or failures. The more cryptocurrencies are attacked, the stronger they become. China bans ICOs and hints at hurting bitcoin exchanges, and the value of bitcoin goes up. The ethereum DAO gets attacked, and ethereum takes hundreds of steps to make itself more robust and secure. It’s not Whack-a-mole, its Block-a-mole!

As for hype and criticism? Both will grow—for the next couple of decades. This is a repeat of 1994. Despite the dotcom crash of 2001, the internet is more talked about today—positively and critically—than an any previous time.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitconnect-slapped-with-securities-emergency-cease-and-desist-order/,"Bitconnect Slapped with Securities Emergency Cease and Desist Order

On Thursday the Texas Securities Commissioner (TSC) signed an Emergency Cease and Desist Order to stop Bitconnect from operating. The mysterious company is a popular bitcoin lending platform with a 4.1 billion USD market capitalization, and is long accused of being a scam.

Bitconnect Ordered Not to Mess with Texas

“The Texas Securities Commissioner has entered an Emergency Cease and Desist Order to halt the multiple investment programs operated by Bitconnect,” the press release reads, “an overseas company that claims a market share of $4.1 billion for its cryptocurrency coins.”

News.Bitcoin.com profiled growing concern within the ecosystem about Bitconnect’s doings back in November as well as through an opinion piece. Then, as now it appears officially, the worry was mostly due to promises made by the English company that seemed impossibly Ponzi.

“Bitconnect is soliciting investors for cryptocurrency-based programs that the company claims will deliver annualized returns of 100% or more,” the TSC outlines. After detailing how they issue their own coins (a fact curiously denied by advocates) with a cap of 28 million, the TSC continues, “The company requires individuals to use Bitcoin, a more established cryptocurrency, to invest in various Bitconnect programs. In one investment called the Bitconnect Lending Program, investors purchase Bitconnect Coins, which are provided to a ‘Bitconnect Trading Bot’ to generate ‘returns as high as 40% a month.’”

Prominent ecosystem lights from Andreas Antonopoulos to Erik Voorhees have also made it clear to move away from the scheme. Mr. Antonopoulos was plagued with advertisements on his Youtube channel, and pleaded with followers to help him untangle. Mr. Voorhees didn’t mince words in his Tweet, flat out telling followers “Bitconnect is a scam. Stay safe out there.” Jameson Lopp was slightly more diplomatic, Tweeting “I’ve been getting more questions about @bitconnect – as far as I can tell, it’s a scam. If you don’t believe me, just compare their (now removed) 2017 roadmap with the (lack of) activity on their GitHub repository.”

Known in the United States as a law enforcement state, Texas’ unusually heavy hand was hardly out of character. All the TSC had to do was find the company’s “investments are securities, but were not registered as required by the Texas Securities Act and State Securities Board Rules and Regulations. In addition, the company is not registered to sell securities in Texas,” and the rest just follows. The across-the-pond entity can appeal the TSC’s decision.

Regulators Scramble to Find Fault

Late last year Texas issued an administrative order against USI-Tech Limited, the Dubai mining investment firm, also asking it immediately cease and desist.

In the present case, regulators are most likely chafing at the thought of more initial coin offerings, unregulated, being advertised to their constituents. Indeed, the press release notes, “Sales agents for Bitconnect are targeting Texas residents, as well as residents of other states, through websites, social media, and online marketplaces like craigslist,” they allege. And while it’s murky at best to assume Texas plays a large role in the assumed scam, here again is the regulator’s logic: “The sales agents are not, however, registered as agents of Bitconnect to sell securities in Texas.”



The TSC notice also mentions an upcoming announced initial coin offering by the company, scheduled for just a few days from now, and how it “operates websites and deploys online advertising to recruit sales agents, which it calls ‘affiliates.’ The company provides marketing material to affiliates, including online presentations, and pays them commissions for referrals that result in investments in” the company’s programs.

Heat

Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles also reasserts what some in the crypto community have found troubling too, that the company “has disclosed virtually nothing about its principals, financial condition, or strategies for earning profits for investors. It has not provided a physical address in England.”

The apology from the mysterious company’s scores of ambassadors usually involves making comparison to the unknown character of Satoshi Nakamoto and lack of centralization around the Bitcoin network. It’s a muddying of crypto waters less are inclined to consider.

Fair or not, one aspect to the firm’s doings is undeniable: they’ve brought heat in terms of regulators, who’re now groping at ways to smoke such projects out, using legal maneuvers other legitimate and worthy projects might eventually be swept up in.

DMM Launching Mining Lab

DMM Group, the operator of popular e-commerce site DMM.com with 27 million members, announced on Thursday the creation of its “research and development specialty lab” for cryptocurrency mining called DMM Mining Labo.

“In pursuing the highest possible hash power,” the company explained that the lab’s team will “go through cycles of experimentations and iterations, enhancing the set-up and tuning of our specialty machines.” The lab will also conduct ongoing research on a wide range of mining rig types and test them in order to find the “optimum balance between their hash power and electricity consumption,” DMM described. The company’s announcement reads:

In the foreseeable future, the goal of DMM Mining Labo is to achieve the highest per unit hash power for our machines…In the long-term future, DMM is examining options for manufacturing of their original mining machines, expanding operations beyond use of ready-made units.

DMM’s Mining Plans

The group first announced its plans to operate “a mass-scale, made in Japan” mining farm back in September of 2017. “DMM plans [to build an] operation that ranks in [the] top three of the world’s mining farm companies in terms of scale,” the company stated at the time, adding that:

During the year 2018, DMM will be one of the 10 largest mining farms in the world.

In its Thursday announcement, DMM said the company is “open to formalized adoption proposals of such technology from research institutes and various development corporations.” It is also looking to collaborate with major manufacturing companies. Furthermore, the lab is “prepared to run formalized testing on samples of pre-market technologies.”

Meanwhile, another Japanese conglomerate, GMO Internet, started a mining operation through its European legal entity last month, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. GMO is using existing technology to mine at its mining center in Northern Europe while developing 7nm chips, the company detailed, adding that it is working on research and development with a partner who possesses the needed semiconductor design technology. GMO plans to use 7nm mining boards in its mining process in the first half of this year and sell them in an initial coin offering (ICO).

The SEC has also issued yet another warning to investors in cryptocurrencies and ICOs.

Here's a rundown of today's moves in cryptocurrency prices, and the details of the latest news.

Today's cryptocurrency prices

Here's a look at the eight largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency Name (Code) Price in U.S. Dollars Day's Change Bitcoin (BTC) $15,068 2% Ripple (XRP) $2.76 (1.4%) Ethereum (ETH) $947.19 3% Bitcoin Cash (BCH) $2,409.20 (5.5%) Cardano (ADA) $1.15 8.8% NEM (XEM) $1.65 9.4% Stellar (XLM) $0.69 (24.5%) Litecoin (LTC) $236.12 (3.8%)

It's been a relatively quiet day for the largest cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum have all barely moved, and bitcoin cash's 5.5% move isn't out of the ordinary.

However, there has been some interesting activity further down the chart. Cardano, which has surged this week, continued its move upward. Stellar, which catapulted past Litecoin on Wednesday, dropped by about 25% in a volatile trading day. And NEM leapfrogged over Stellar and Litecoin to move into the number six position.

NEM jumps to sixth place

Through a combination of a 9% pop, and drops in both Stellar and Litecoin, NEM (which stands for New Economy Movement) jumped into sixth place on the list of the largest cryptocurrencies.

Like Cardano, Stellar, and several other cryptocurrencies, NEM was designed to address some of the challenges facing bitcoin's blockchain technology, specifically in terms of scale and speed. Also like some of the other recently-surging coins, NEM is focusing on enterprise clients, aiming to facilitate peer-to-peer payments and money transfers.

Merrill Lynch bans bitcoin-related investments

Merrill Lynch has banned its clients and advisors from buying (or recommending) bitcoin or related investments. This includes the newly created bitcoin futures, as well as the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC:GBTC). Existing positions in brokerage accounts can be kept, but not in fee-based advisory accounts.

In a nutshell, Merrill Lynch is concerned about these types of investments given the recent bubble-like environment. According to an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, ""The decision to close GBTC to new purchases is driven by concerns pertaining to suitability and eligibility standards of this product.""

The SEC warns cryptocurrency investors (again)

The SEC warned investors to ""exercise caution"" with cryptocurrencies, saying in its warning that regulators may not be able to recoup money lost due to illegal activity. In other words, if you invest in a cryptocurrency or Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that ends up being a scam, or is illegally manipulated, you may have little or no recourse.

This comes on the heels of an extensive warning to investors by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton that provided guidance for investors on how to approach investing in ICOs.",2018-01-04

Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency flagship entered 2018 at a relatively quiet pace, but started to pick up around the end of this week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is up 14.55% for the week.

Ethereum: Although losing its #2 market cap spot to Ripple’s explosive run, Ethereum broke through the $1,000 price barrier to near $1,075 with a gain of 31.82% for the week.

Ripple Now the Second Most Valuable Currency: This has been a wild and exciting ride for Ripple investors this week. The currency reached an ATH of $3.81, a 1424% increase from 30 days prior. The dramatic increase comes as a global interest in cryptocurrency continues to grow and given ripples practical usage (with big-name financial partnerships) for cross-border payments.

Altcoins Help Crypto Market Cap Reach ATH of $700 Billion: December may not have been the best month for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, however “the pre-Christmas sell-off seems to be well behind us now”, states eToro Analyst Mati Greenspan. According to CoinMarketCap on January 4th at the time of writing, the total market capitalization was nearly $762 Billion.

Tron Enters the Top Ten Arena: In the past 7 days alone, the official currency of Tron (TRX) grew nearly 444% to reach around $.28. Tron is currently in the 6th position in market cap size. Tron has made recent headlines for its astonishing growth, as well as big-name partnerships and starstudded business team.

Stellar Soars to New Heights: The tech behind Stellar (formerly known as Stellar Lumens) is nearly identical to Ripple, making a strong case for many investors to view the Stellar project as a credible coin with a bright future. When John McCaleb left Ripple to start Stellar, one can assume that not even McCaleb could predict that Stellar would reach ATH’s of $0.91 so quickly. The valuation marks a close to 10 fold increase from its $.09 cent valuation seen in early December. Stellar grew 127% for the week.

Peter Thiel’s Silicon Valley Venture Capital Firm Places Big Bet on Bitcoin: In mid-2017, the Founder’s Fund spent between $15 Million to $20 Million on Bitcoin. At the time, the price of Bitcoin was around $2,500. Thiel deems Bitcoin the gold of cryptocurrency, speculating that it is highly undervalued at its current value.

Crypto’s New Billionaire Mile: Watch out Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and Jeff Bezos, there’s a fresh set of Billionaires in town. On Monday, January 1st, 2018, with a market cap of $88,900,000,000, the CEO’s/founders of Ripple were worth as follows: Chris Larsen ($37.3 billion), Brad Garlinghouse ($9.5 billion), and Jed McCaleb (5.3 billion XRP). However, considering crypto’s volatile nature, there’s no guarantee they will remain in this category long-term.

Criminals & Crypto: While Bitcoin became notorious for its facilitation of transactions in the black market, a recent trend towards using more private coins, such as Monero, has alarmed officials. According to the Europol, the European Union Agency for Law enforcement, Monero along with “Ethereum and Zcash are gaining popularity within the digital underground.” While these coins are seemingly untrackable, companies like Chainalysis are enhancing measures to combat these criminals which include crimes such as money laundering and extortion.

BitConnect Slapped with Cease and Desist: The infamous bitcoin lending platform BitConnect is in hot water after the Texas Securities Commissioner issued an Emergency Cease and Desist Order. The controversial platform has a 4.1 billion USD market cap and is shrouded in mystery.

Cryptocurrency News from Around the World

Japanese Finance Mammoth Claims Bitcoin Increases GDP by 0.3%: According to two analysts at Nomura, “the scale of this increase in assets can hardly be ignored.” With the “wealth effect”, cryptocurrency investors who feel richer are taking their new fortunes and turning them into “real world” spending. Currently, approximately 3.7 million worth of bitcoins is held by 1 million Japanese citizens.

Egypt’s Grand Mufti Claims Bitcoin is “Un-Islamic”: After consulting with various economic experts, Grand Mufti Shawki Allam stated that cryptocurrency in itself goes against the Islamic faith. Comparing cryptocurrency to gambling (which is forbidden in Islam), the Grand Mufti stated that virtual currency goes hand-in-hand with “direct responsibility in financial ruin for individuals.” Similarly, in November of 2017, the head religious authority in Turkey remarked congruent statements, citing digital currencies to be criminal in nature and therefore against Islam.

President Reagan’s Prior Office of Management Director Thinks We are All “Stupid Speculators”: David Stockman is clearly no fan of cryptocurrency. In fact, in an interview with CNBC show “Futures Now”, Stockman stated “It’s basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash.” It should be noted that Stockman often has a bearish outlook in the financial world.

While Bitcoin Surges, the USD Declines: With a 10% loss, the US dollar experienced its biggest annual decrease compared to other major currencies since 2003. While fiat currencies such as the euro and pound strengthened against the dollar, none were quite as powerful as digital currencies, including Bitcoins 1,341 percent increase in value from the beginning to end of 2017.",2018-01-05 17:44:26-08:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-surpasses-1000-for-the-first-time-factors-behind-increase,"Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency Ether has surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time, achieving a new all-time high merely five days into 2018.

The recent surge in Ether price and the market valuation of the Ethereum Blockchain network can be largely attributed to two main factors: the abrupt surge in the value of Ripple (XRP) and the rising user activity of decentralized applications.

In late December of 2017, Ripple overtook Ethereum for the first time in history, becoming the third alternative cryptocurrency with the exception of Ether and Bitcoin Cash to become the second largest cryptocurrency in the global market behind Bitcoin.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange market, which has accounted for nearly 50 percent of global Ripple trades over the past week, pushed the market valuation of Ripple from $40 bln to $120 bln within less than a month.

The recent rally of Ethereum can be seen as its highly anticipated long overdue recovery and the early signs of competition against Ripple. Merely two days ago, Ripple became the first alternative cryptocurrency to surpass the $100 bln mark. Yesterday, on Jan. 4, the Ethereum network achieved a $100 bln market cap as well.

Can the valuation of Ethereum be justified?

Currently, the Ethereum Blockchain network processes more transactions than all of the Blockchain networks in the global market combined, including Bitcoin. According to EtherScan, the Ethereum network is settling nearly 1.4 mln transactions on a daily basis, which is substantially higher than that of the Bitcoin Blockchain network, which settles 420,000 transactions per day.

Charlie Lee, former Coinbase executive and Litecoin creator, noted that transaction volume and user activity are important factors investors must consider in analyzing the performance and future trend of cryptocurrencies. In the two categories, Ethereum is in an optimal position to surge in value.

As you can see, Litecoin is doing very well in terms of growth in usage. This chart shows the growth in the past year compared to other coins.

Can Ether triple?

In consideration of the two above mentioned categories, billionaire investor Mike Novogratz, who has been an active advocate of cryptocurrencies and long-term investor, stated that Ethern price has the potential to increase by threefold by the end of 2018.

Already, since November when Novogratz predicted Ether price to triple, Ether price has doubled.

""Ethereum, which I think just touched $500 or is getting close, could be triple where it is as well.”

Cointelegraph also reported that decentralized applications on the Ethereum network such as CryptoKitties and EtherDelta have started to gain massive popularity and users. In the future, the emergence of Ethereum decentralized app browsers that will operate as app marketplaces like Google Play Store and Apple App Stores will drive the adoption of decentralized applications, improving the accessibility of the Ethereum network.

“To imagine the current structure of Ethereum’s decentralized application market, one has to consider the mobile app era prior to the existence of Google Play Store and Apple App Store. At that time, users had to download apps from websites directly from the distributors and developers.”

If decentralized app browsers become adopted at a larger scale and the Ethereum network scales, analysts like Novogratz see Ether price surging from its current level.",,https://www.inverse.com/article/39947-ripple-vs-bitcoin-5-biggest-differences-between-the-cryptocurrencies,"Ripple is making waves. The cryptocurrency has burst onto the scene at the start of this year, with a surging value that’s pushed Ethereum aside to grab the title of second-largest token.

There’s a number of key differences between Bitcoin and Ripple. The former was first outlined back in 2008, and following a big run at the end of last year now holds value of $16,426 per token. Ripple, founded in 2012, has seen big interest from businesses including three Japanese credit card companies. It currently holds a deceptively low value of $3.12 per token.

Here are some of the key differences between the two cryptocurrencies, and what you need to know most:

Decentralization

Bitcoin and Ripple have very different governance and ownership structures.

Bitcoin is highly decentralized and open source, owned by a community that agrees on changes. This can make upgrades tough. Developers can use “soft forks” to avoid irreversible splits, which are backwards-compatible changes to the system’s use that allows nodes to opt in and out of the changes, avoiding breaks in the network. However, at least 51 percent of bitcoin mining power needs to support the change to avoid an irreversible “hard fork.”

Ripple is owned by a private company, and its internal ledger is a more closed affair. The company’s consensus-seeking approach can allow for faster upgrades. With the amendment system, developers seek consensus before making changes to the network. In most cases, if an amendment receives 80 percent support for two weeks, it will come into effect and all future ledgers must support it. This enables a democratized approach to development that allows for changes while avoiding irreversible splits.

End Goals

Bitcoin and Ripple have conflicting approaches to cryptocurrency. Where Bitcoin’s decentralized approach means anyone can use it for whatever they feel like, Ripple is marketing its cryptocurrency as an asset transfer solution for major calculations. The company touts more than 100 customers, with more than 75 of those clients deploying Ripple commercially.

Size

Bitcoin is huge. At the time of writing, the total valuation of all bitcoins in circulation is at $276 billion, while Ripple is at $120 billion. These two rest at the top of the cryptocurrency pile, while the total market is valued at $769 billion.

This may seem confusing, considering the discrepancy in the price of a single token. The important thing to bear in mind, though, is that there are 38 billion XRP tokens in the world, and just 16 million bitcoins. This means that each bitcoin is more valuable, but the entire market isn’t too far off Ripple’s valuation.

Coins in Reserve

The creators of both cryptocurrenies hold a number of tokens in reserve. In the case of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto — a pseudonym for the coin’s anonymous creator — reportedly holds 980,000 of the total possible 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist. Sergio Lerner, head of cryptocurrency firm rsk.co., claimed in 2013 that these untouched bitcoins almost certainly belong to Nakamoto as the founder would have complete confidence in his creation.

A similar case exists with Ripple. The company holds around 62 percent of all the XRP supply, which is capped at 100 billion.

Transaction times and fees

Bitcoin has come under fire for its transaction times and fees. Users can pay miner to prioritize their transaction. As a result, average fees have risen to $27, while each transaction takes on average 70 minutes to clear.

Ripple requires a minimum transaction cost to avoid overloading the network. At the time of writing, this is 0.00001 XRP, or a fraction of a cent. To pay the fee, the network destroys the XRP rather than paying it to anyone in particular, which in turn increases the value of the remaining XRP.

Ripple transactions can settle in as little as four seconds thanks to what’s known as “off-ledger” transactions. Essentially, a provider batch processes a number of transactions before putting them on the blockchain, maintaining the security features of cryptocurrency while avoiding the hassle of logging each transaction at a time.

A similar solution for Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, is under development. Whether it’s enough to turn things around for Bitcoin, and potentially encourage the same business adoption as Ripple, remains to be seen.",,https://studybreaks.com/tvfilm/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-not-secure/,"While the recent market optimism for cryptocurrencies — such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin — has encouraged millennials to use these cryptocurrencies in the place of standard banking, American college and university students should carefully consider the risks of using digital currencies.

In his article, Joshua Althauser, a writer for Cointelegraph, the online newspaper offering the latest news on Fintech, Blockchain and Bitcoin, presents a survey on why millennials prefer banking using cryptocurrencies over traditional banking. One in four millennials invests their money in a digital currency such as Bitcoin instead of opening traditional bank accounts, claiming that they earn more from their Bitcoin investments and their money is safer.

As outlined well in Marissa Cortes’s article on Study Breaks concerning the withdrawal of support from the use of bitcoin currency by American video game developer and digital distribution company Valve on their platform Steam, a digital gaming service, merits a second look into the hype about cryptocurrencies — especially for those students currently using or investing in cryptocurrencies.

Although there is still doubt about his identity and developed initially unintentionally in 2008, Japanese-American computer engineer Satoshi Nakamoto did not envision creating an entire currency when he built Bitcoin, the first and still most significant cryptocurrency. Nakamoto’s now infamous white paper, or report, on what would become digital currency was “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.”

To prevent the occurrence of double spending, which is when one party in a transaction spends the same amount twice, Satoshi developed a record-keeping system to keep the network secure.

In a decentralized peer-to-peer network — one with no central authority, but rather with various sources controlling the money supply — each entity of the network must arrive to a consensus on a transaction and whether this transaction should be added as a block to the blockchain, an incorruptible collection or ledger of economic transactions programmed to record financial transactions. If there is disagreement in the network, the network breaks — it requires absolute consensus to continue.

Once absolute consensus is achieved, a transaction requires confirmation — a critical concept to understanding the inner workings of cryptocurrencies. An unconfirmed transaction is pending and can be forged, meaning that the transaction can still be altered. However, once confirmed, a transaction is irreversible and becomes part of a record of previous transactions in the network: the blockchain. Individuals called miners, anyone with an internet connection and proper hardware on their computer, are the only ones who can confirm a transaction.

Though anyone can become a miner, as a power check, miners must submit some of their computing work before achieving the status of a miner in the form of a hash, a product of cryptographic function or a mathematical operation run on digital data.

The process is called Proof-of-Work in which a miner, for the work they have produced on a blockchain, received a reward, typically in the form of digital currency, for each mathematical problem solved. Though the set of cryptographic hash functions differs among cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin explicitly operates under the Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA 256).

It is useful to consider William Mougayar’s idea of a blockchain as a Google doc: “The traditional way of sharing documents with collaboration is to send a Microsoft Word document to another recipient, and ask them to make revisions to it. The problem with that scenario is that you need to wait until receiving a return copy before you can see or make other changes because you are locked out of editing it until the other person is done with it.

That’s how banks maintain money balances and transfers; they briefly lock access (or decrease the balance) while they make a transfer, then update the other side, then re-open access (or update again). With Google Docs (or Google Sheets), both parties have access to the same document at the same time, and the single version of that document is always visible to both of them. It is like a shared ledger, but it is a shared document.”

While cryptocurrency advocates boast of the highly secure nature of the blockchain, miners have the ominous possibility of overtaking the consensual peer-to-peer network in what has been deemed as the 51 percent attack.

Though still only a hypothetical scenario, a group of miners, if they gain control over 50 percent of the network’s computing power, would be able to prevent the confirmation of transactions, or reverse transactions to cause one party to double spend. Given that the network is pseudonymous, decentralized and that miners can be anyone, the network also sets up ripe conditions for a hacker attack—that could potentially upset the established balance in the network.

Some of Bitcoin’s key security features also place added risk on cryptocurrency users. Lauded by many as a critical reason to consider cryptocurrencies as a banking option, the absence of an intermediary’s intervention such as a financial institution places added risk on the user. The irreversibility of the confirmation process in a transaction puts cryptocurrency users at risk of theft.

In traditional banking, a client may call financial customer service intermediaries to assist in the event of making a mistake while banking online such as depositing funds to the wrong account or entering the incorrect amount for a bill payment. However, with digital currency, once a transaction is confirmed no one can undo said transaction. In this way, it is imperative to double, triple and quadruple check to ensure the correct amount of funds is sent and to the correct addressee.

On that note, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies also makes this network vulnerable to hackers. To make matters worse, there is no opportunity for pressing charges or ability to obtain said funds back — the funds are as good as gone.

According to Dave Liedtka and Erik Schatzker’s article in Bloomberg Technology, Bitcoin is becoming a more and more volatile stock to invest in as it lost 20 percent of its total value just this past week. While it is normally difficult to predict the increase or decrease of any stock, investing in cryptocurrencies is a precarious option that may not yield desired results. In its sudden rise in the stock market, it has also gone down by almost 80 percent of its stock on five separate occasions.

However, for those who are insistent on using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, there are ways to secure your wallet such as Bugis Credit. Instead of using a basic wallet, consider a hardware wallet such as through Trezor or Ledger in which you can store your cryptocurrency by yourself in a more secure way.

Perhaps Thomas Carper, U.S. Senator of Delaware, best sums up the current cryptocurrency craze Americans and the world are witnessing: “Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others, and confused the heck out of the rest of us.”",2018-01-05 12:00:36-06:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/visa-veto-leaves-several-european-cryptocurrency-cards-locked-out/,"Visa Veto Leaves Several European Cryptocurrency Cards Locked Out

European cryptocurrency card holders are awakening to discover that their plastic is now worthless. A Visa-led crackdown has seen several crypto card issuers forced to call an end to their services across Europe. Visa subsidiary Wavecrest is being blamed for the withdrawal of service, which affects scores of crypto card issuers including Bitwala, Tenx, Bitpay, and Xapo.

Visa Issues a Veto

Seemingly overnight, Visa, acting via Wavecrest, has put an end to cryptocurrency cards. The prepaid cards, which have become extremely popular in the crypto community, provide a means of indirectly paying for goods and services using cryptocurrency. The cards are a means of bridging the gap between the fiat and crypto worlds, preventing hodlers from needing to cash out to spend their digital assets.

As a result of the surprise crackdown, companies such as Cryptopay, Bitwala, and Bitpay have been left with no choice but to end their European services and return funds to users. Upon news of the clampdown emerging, the price of the PAY token linked to the Tenx card dropped by 15%. With the Tenx wallet on Bittrex still offline, seemingly as a result of the Spectre bug being patched, many token-holders have been unable to transfer PAY from their mobile wallets to their normal exchange. The Tenx PAY token was trading at $5 hours ago, but is now sitting at around $4.30.

Bitwala were one of the first card-issuers to break the story to their customers, tweeting:

Cryptopay tweeted: “Unfortunately, our card issuer instructed us to cease all Cryptopay prepaid cards starting January 5th, 2018. All funds stored on cards are safe and will be returned to your Cryptopay accounts ASAP. Sorry for all the inconvenience caused, we’re working on the solution!” Other crypto card companies have yet to pass comment, but it appears that the vast majority of European cryptocurrency cards are reliant on the Gibraltar-based Wavepay including Uquid, Coinsbank, Spectrocoin, Advcash, and Wirex.

Xapo’s European Service is Zapped

In an email sent to its customers today, Xapo explained: “Unfortunately, Xapo did not receive any anticipated notice to prepare for – and have our cardholders prepare for – the cancellation of our Card program.” It continued:

Your Xapo Card has been deactivated, and you will not be able to use it for further payments or withdrawals. The rest of your Xapo account remains active, and you can continue to access your Xapo wallet balance and funds without interruptions. All other Xapo services are available for your use, as always.

The email finished: “As a token of our appreciation for being a loyal Xapo customer, once we are able to service Xapo Cards in your country again, we will offer you a new card free of charge. We are hard at work to find alternative card solutions for you. The past years have shown what a powerful product a cryptocurrency payment card can be, and we are already in discussions with potential card issuers allowing Xapo to continue serving customers in Europe and beyond.”

Legacy Finance Lashes Out

The reasons for Visa electing to wield the banhammer are unclear, though the company has long been regarded as hostile to bitcoin. Given that bitcoin threatens to disrupt the status quo, of which Visa is a firmly entrenched part, that tallies. Visa has stated that the cards have been suspended due to “continued non-compliance with our operating rules”, and insists the move isn’t part of a targeted campaign against cryptocurrency. It also claims that Visa cards which convert Bitcoin into fiat currency won’t be affected by the decision, stating:

Visa has other approved card programmes that use fiat funds converted from cryptocurrency in a number of jurisdictions. The termination of WaveCrest’s Visa membership does not affect these other products.

Web-users who value their financial freedom have long been been wary of Visa. This is the company, after all, which facilitated the financial blockade of Wikileaks in 2011. That decision ultimately proved to be Wikileaks’ salvation, with Julian Assange later crowing that the switch to bitcoin caused a windfall as the cryptocurrency began to multiply in price.

The repercussions of the Wavepay edict are still being felt, and it is too early to say whether the affected crypto companies will be able to find an alternative payment processor. Whatever the reason for the ban, the case illustrates something bitcoiners have known for years: too much centralization is a dangerous thing.

Do you think Visa has valid reasons for shutting down crypto cards, or is it simply hostile to cryptocurrency? Let us know in the comments section below.

In December, the virtual currency’s value rose by over 400% amid the hysteria surrounding the rise in crypto-giant Bitcoin.

Dogecoin – which was introduced in 2013 and has a meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog as its logo – is an altcoin which are peer-to-peer digital tokens that descended from Bitcoin.

Jackson Palmer, the founder of the cryptocurrency, told Coin Desk the surge in Dogecoin speaks volumes for the current state of the altcoin market.

There are currently more than a thousand digital currencies on the market with Bitcoin taking up 40% of the market.

Other popular atlcoins include Ethereum and Ripple – with the latter having a massive 35,000 per cent jump in value in 2017.

Dave Chapman, managing director at digital assets trading house Octagon Strategy, said the popularity of altcoins owes to a perception that Bitcoin’s value is now out of reach for ordinary buyers.

Bitcoin and ethereum both saw their values skyrocket in 2017, largely on the strength of newfound investor interest in the cryptocurrency space, media hype, and the initial coin offering (ICO) craze. However, the cryptocurrency with the largest percentage increase in price was ripple (XRP). (See also: How Do I Buy Ripple (XRP) Cryptocurrency?)

Though founded in 2012, ripple hovered at just a fraction of one cent per token going into 2017. As of this writing, it is worth more than $3 per token. How much would $100 invested in XRP in early January 2017 be worth today?

From $0.006 to $3.02

According to data from CoinMarketCap.com, the price of one XRP token on January 2, 2017 was $0.006396. Investing $100 in XRP at that time would have enabled you to purchase 15,634.77 XRP tokens. (Note: That's assuming you didn't have to pay a transaction fee. Given that different exchanges require different fees, it's simpler for our purposes to eliminate the fee consideration. In actuality, though, your $100 would have yielded somewhat fewer tokens than indicated above.)

As of this writing, according to CoinMarketCap.com, one XRP token is valued at $3.02. Given your 15,634.77 XRP purchased one year ago, your ripple holdings would now be worth a whopping $46,904.32. This is including the $100 you spent on your initial purchase. Needless to say, your initial investment would have yielded tremendous results.

Effects of a Bubble?

While some investors might look to the results above as a sign of easy money to be made in the cryptocurrency market, many others see this as further confirmation that digital currencies are in a bubble (or perhaps multiple bubbles).

This type of risk/reward ratio is essentially unheard of, and investors should not assume that it can be duplicated in the future. A slightly more diversified investment (say, $100 in each of the top 10 cryptocurrencies) over a similar period would have yielded returns of more than $64,000, according to a report by Forbes. Still, this may be more the product of lucky timing than anything else. (See also: Ripple Execs Are Now Billionaires Thanks to XRP's Success.)

Fresh reports have emerged about a crackdown—though not an outright ban—on bitcoin mining operations in China. Bloomberg reported Wednesday (Jan. 3) that the nation’s central bank has outlined plans to curb the power supply to some bitcoin miners, citing unnamed sources. Reuters noted that the bank intends to tell local governments to regulate miners’ power usage to “gradually reduce the scale of their production.” Chinese business magazine Caixin, meanwhile, reported that (paywall) authorities will no longer offer mining companies preferential benefits such as discounted electricity and tax deductions.

The crackdown could well put an end to China’s dominance in bitcoin mining.

The country accounts for more than two-thirds of the world’s processing power devoted to bitcoin mining. It’s also home to some of the world’s leading creators of mining hardware, such as Beijing-based Bitmain. These hardware makers usually also operate large mining “pools”—groups of miners who agree to add up their resources to improve their odds of finding bitcoin.

Cheap electricity is a major advantage for bitcoin miners in China. Coal-abundant regions such as Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia have in recent years taken to crypto mining as a niche approach to transforming their less-developed economies.

Bitmain, a mining giant, has taken advantage of cheap coal-fired power in those two regions to build several of the world’s largest mining facilities. In Inner Mongolia’s Ordos city, local authorities offer the company a subsidized electricity rate of just 4 US cents per kilowatt hour. That’s 30% cheaper than what industrial firms in the area typically pay, and well below prices in the US and most European Union countries.

Miners get even cheaper rates by bargaining with hydropower stations—rather than local or national grids—in the mountainous Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. At one stage, Bitmain’s mining facility in Yunnan enjoyed a rate of less than 2 US cents per kWh, according to company executive Su Jiahai. Such practices are carried out in a legal grey area but make perfect business sense for both sides. In a 2015 column for CoinDesk, Chinese miner Eric Mu explained why a hydropower station in Sichuan agreed to power his company’s mining operations:

[The power station] couldn’t obtain the quota enabling them [to] sell power to [the] national grid, which prefers the state-owned power stations over those that are privately-owned. Also, the county-level grid could only consume a small percentage of the power the station generated. When Wu Gang [Mu’s colleague] appeared on the scene with a wacky idea to mine bitcoin using hydropower, people were initially skeptical. However, once they overcame this initial bout of confusion, it was clear a win-win arrangement could be formed.

Bitcoin mining in China is “mainly an opportunistic way of making some money out of the failures and inefficiencies of the power system.”

Bitcoin mining in China is “mainly an opportunistic way of making some money out of the failures and inefficiencies of the power system,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, a Beijing-based campaigner with Greenpeace. The massive hydropower networks in Sichuan and Yunnan were built to transfer electricity to the rest of the country, noted Myllyvirta, but state-run grid operators too often fail to prioritize renewable energy over coal. In 2016, Yunnan wasted a staggering 32 billion kWh (link in Chinese) of hydropower, about equal to the total electricity consumption of Denmark the same year.

The crackdown on miners comes amid China’s efforts to reduce the country’s power glut and better transfer electricity to where it’s needed the most. As Bloomberg notes, the annual increase in China’s installed generating capacity has fallen to its slowest rate since 2010, and 15 of the 16 lines in its ultra-high-voltage transmission network—designed to send power from the oversupplied north and west to the east—will be completed this year.

As China continues to make better use of its power system, miners in the country may find their lives getting tougher, and feel the need to seek cheaper power in other parts of the world. In fact, some of them have already done so. A Beijing-based mining firm told Quartz in November that it is scouting for backup options in Sweden and Canada for the tens of thousands of mining machines it currently operates in Xinjiang, although the company has no specific timetable to move out. Bitmain for its part has set up a regional headquarters in Singapore.

Already, the Chinese government has effectively killed bitcoin trading in a country that once dominated the global market. Soon, bitcoin mining could be the next to fall.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-valuations-have-created-very-wealthy-founders/,"Cryptocurrency Valuations Have Created Very Wealthy Founders

Bitcoin has been on a tear for well over a year now, but a few other cryptocurrencies have increased in value far more than BTC. This past week the two digital assets ripple (XRP) and ethereum (ETH) have spiked in value exponentially, making the founders of these projects some of the wealthiest men in the world — Right up there with bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto.

Also read: Visa Veto Leaves Several European Cryptocurrency Cards Locked Out

The Founders of Bitcoin, Ripple, and Ethereum Are Among the Richest Individuals On Earth

The total market capitalization of all the digital assets combined is currently over $770Bn and is quickly approaching the $1 trillion mark. A bunch of cryptocurrencies have been rising, but four digital assets in particular, bitcoin core, ethereum, ripple, and bitcoin cash as well, have made the founders of these projects very rich. It is believed that at one time Satoshi Nakamoto may have mined over 1 million BTC during the first year the original bitcoin codebase was born. RSK Labs chief scientist, Sergio Lerner, has done quite a bit of research on the fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto. According to Lerner’s report, Nakamoto using a single computer may have mined over 1 million BTC, and none of these coins have ever been spent.

At the time of writing Satoshi’s net worth with all of his BTC reserves is roughly around $16Bn USD. That number does not include the tokens Nakamoto owns from the recent fork last summer creating the digital asset bitcoin cash (BCH). Nakamoto’s BCH reserves gives the creator another $2.6Bn as both assets make the anonymous group or person among the top 200 wealthiest people on earth. Many bitcoin investors are confident with the fact that Satoshi is missing and believe he’s not a threat to the market as far as dumping his coins. Some believe the creator may be a threat in the future if Nakamoto decides to spend those coins. So far, Satoshi has been gone since 2010, and the coins in his possession have not moved since the day they were mined.

Ripple Co-Founder Chris Larsen is Worth More Than the Founders of Google

Another digital asset market valuation that has grown exponentially is the ripple (XRP) market which is worth over $120Bn USD right now. This makes the co-founder of Ripple Labs, Chris Larsen, to be worth an estimated $50Bn and among the 200 wealthiest individuals in the world. Ripple has been controversial since its inception creating 100Bn XRPs and releasing only 38Bn of these tokens to the general public. Ripple Labs, Chris Larsen, and the other co-founders are in control of a vast majority of the uncirculated XRPs. A 100 billion is a significant number making people leery from investing in the project, especially when over 50Bn are held by the founders. Ripple investors believe the price of XRP gained significantly in value because Ripple Labs promises to keep the ‘founders coin’ in a time-locked escrow.

ETH Inventor Vitalik Buterin: ‘I Am Not Going to Apologize for Sound Financial Planning’

Lastly, the other digital currency founder who is one of the wealthiest individuals on earth is the inventor of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. Back in 2016, Buterin told the public on the forum Reddit that he held roughly 630,000 ETH. At the moment less than half of the total ETH ever to be released is in circulation which makes Buterin a very wealthy individual holding $656.5Mn worth of ether. However later that year Buterin disclosed that he had sold over 25 percent of his original ETH holdings making his estimated worth roughly $500Mn.

“I’ve sold about a quarter of my ETH — Meh, I am not going to apologize for sound financial planning,” explains Buterin.

Cryptocurrencies Have Created the Largest Transfer in Wealth Since the 1800s

The birth of bitcoin and other digital assets that followed is proving to be one of the largest transfers of wealth since the 1850s when people discovered oil. Cryptocurrencies have made these founders extremely wealthy, and investors of these blockchain tokens don’t seem concerned about the founder’s holdings. To these people, it’s likely that people like Nakamoto, Larsen, and Buterin won’t ‘dump’ their reserves in order to keep the cryptocurrency growing in value. Many individuals and those who are confident in these founders understand that if they did dump their coins on the market, it would be devastating.

What do you think of the founders of these digital currency projects becoming the wealthiest people on earth? Do you think investors should be worried about these vast holdings? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

News reports are full of this magic internet money’s rocketing value – currently $16,000 – and Facebook is dotted with people who picked some up at $500, $50 or even 50 cents. But the cryptocurrency ship hasn’t yet sailed. In the volatile market of alternative cryptos, relatively unknown alt-coins such as ripple, litecoin and ethereum regularly shoot up by hundreds of per cent in a matter of weeks, and plummet just as fast. Bitcoin envy has brought in vast sums of new money, dollar-eyed investors taking a Las Vegas gamble on which of the more than 1,000 alt-coins might rocket next. In September the cryptocurrency market cap was $137bn. Today it’s $800bn. It’s a blockchain gold rush.

In mid-December a Facebook friend well-versed in crypto tipped Cardano’s ADA, which at 21 cents was just the tip I was after. Little did I know I was riding unarmed into a lawless digital wild west, where fortunes are made and lost on a tweet and every shill, trickster, bot and conman is using all the unregulated tricks in the book to make a fast buck. And this was undoubtedly my first rodeo.

For a form of currency designed to wrestle financial control away from centralised banks and governments and back into the hands of the people, there is a surprising amount of red tape involved with buying cryptocurrency online. It took me two days to pass security checks on depository Coinbase and crypto exchange Binance and scour Reddit to find out how a digital “wallet” worked. One night my wife woke me at 5am: ADA was 51 cents and rising fast. I scrambled for the laptop and bought all the ADA I could.

Rookie mistake: the Fomo – “fear of missing out” – buy. The pump quickly turned to dump – a regular cycle in cryptocurrency – and ADA drifted painfully downwards. With my very first trade I was that most maligned of crypto trader noob – the top-buyer.

‘It is easier for a 3 cent coin to go to 3 dollars, than it is for a $300 coin to go to £30,000’

Let loose in this cyber-cash chocolate factory, I browsed further. Avoid the vast number of scam “shitcoins” floating around and the potential is clearly enormous. If bitcoin is the Atari of internet money – a slow, first-generation technology with heavy fees – then the faster and cheaper ethereum and litecoin are its ZX Spectrums, and the crypto community is jostling to discover the third-gen PlayStation, with each new alt-coin designed for an innovative purpose. Due diligence is key: you’re looking for a respectable team with an innovative project that could eventually reach mass adoption, a strong support community and a bargain price for a coin with a small circulating supply.

John McAfee, head of McAfee Antivirus and a major voice in crypto, tweeted, “it is easier for a 3 cent coin to go to 3 dollars, than it is for a $300 dollar coin to go to $30,000”, so I looked to the cheaper coins for my future fortune. Most intriguing was a five-center called verge (or XVG), tipped by McAfee as the next big privacy coin. Several years in development, verge was created by a team of volunteers led by head developer Justin Vendetta and were promising the imminent release of Wraith Protocol, a means by which users can make a transaction with verge either public or untraceable at the flick of a switch. You could pay your gas bill and run a Mexican drug cartel with the same currency.

Verge was already a phenomenon. On the back of a single tweet from McAfee, the price had shot up 2,000% in a couple of days, and almost 30,000% in 2017; $400 of verge purchased in January would now be worth $17m. With McAfee claiming Verge could hit $15 in a year, it sure looked like the future. I grabbed me a hefty chunk.

I wasn’t alone. All of crypto’s shadowed eyes were on verge. Its bullish community of supporters filled Twitter with entreaties to HODL – hold on for dear life – until it goes “to the moon” and everyone can buy “lambos”. Within a couple of days, as the hype about Wraith Protocol’s spread and firm promises were made that it would be released before 2018 was rung in, the price tripled. On the day bitcoin crashed to $10,000, taking most of the market with it, verge soared, hitting almost 30 cents. Graph readers were suggesting the release of Wraith would shoot the value to 70 cents or more.

I found myself obsessed, constantly monitoring Twitter, waking in the night to check coin tracking apps. Pundits were hailing verge as a game-changer, the next bitcoin. Unbelievers pointed to previous missed deadlines and called it “vaporware”, a nonexistent con, the biggest scam in crypto history. In this unprecedented hype, there was clearly unprecedented money to be made.

And more than one way to make it. Three things hold sway over these unregulated crypto markets: coin innovations, bitcoin whales manipulating prices with huge pump and dumps, and social media. The merest hint of FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) on a coin’s Twitter or Reddit threads can tank its price quickly, and as the final days of 2017 slipped by with Wraith Protocol still unreleased, the FUDers went to town on verge.

A crypto tipster named Marquis Trill tweeted his 4.6 million followers on Christmas Day to “sell XVG!”, claiming he had proof from a Reddit whistleblower that the Wraith Protocol project was falling apart. The price plummeted, only to recover again when Trill claimed his Twitter had been hacked and the allegation proved false. In the dip, a new verge wallet was opened and 2bn coins were purchased, 14% of the supply. Someone, somewhere, on the back of just two tweets, had made millions in minutes. If that wallet suddenly emptied when verge went to the moon on the release of Wraith, one commenter suggested, it would be “the heist of the century”.

Then, on 27 December, McAfee posted a tweet claiming his prediction of a future $15 price for verge had come from a fake account, and that he’d only ever claimed it would reach 15 cents. Verge’s price dropped to that amount.

In retaliation, on 30 December, the coin’s highest-profile Twitter supporter XVG Whale posted a series of texts claiming to be from McAfee, demanding the team give him more than $1m in ethereum or he’d tweet the coin into the ground. New Twitter accounts were opened, tweeting FUD about verge 170 times a day to drive the price down; in the dips, that monster wallet grew by 2m coins every half hour. Dark forces were at work, and all us minnows could do as the days ticked by was strap ourselves in to the Wraith Protocol rocket and hope that, come midnight on New Year’s Eve, its release would shoot us moonwards. For verge, and my fledgling portfolio, this was death or glory.

At 5am on New Year’s Day, I and thousands of #Vergefam sat hunched over verge’s Twitter feed as eagerly as Beyoncé fans awaiting a surprise album drop, counting down the ball in Times Square. Five, four, three, two, one … nothing. Like thousands of others, I hit the sell button; the price dropped 3 cents in as many seconds. Then a tweet from Vendetta citing a last-minute bug steadied the price and I bought straight back in, but the short-term profit seekers had hopped off and, when Wraith Protocol arrived four hours late, a site quickly popped up claiming to have hacked the first batch of IP addresses from it. By the time this was proved to be fake news the Verge price had dwindled to 13 cents, and the momentum of cryptocurrency’s biggest moment was lost.

Then a minor miracle. Once the FUD cleared and Wraith was shown to work exactly as promised, Verge’s price rallied to about 20 cents, with tipsters predicting it to hit $1 in the coming months. They might be a small band of developers with poor PR being buffeted by the malevolent winds of crypto, but verge is the game-changer, not the scam. So, yes, the bitcoin bubble might soon burst, bringing this whole, wild rollercoaster ride off the rails, but I’ll be HODLing my verge for a year or two. Meanwhile, ADA quietly hit $1.20. Perhaps I’ll be opening that lambo dealership on the moon yet.",2018-01-07,https://www.coindesk.com/meltdown-spectre-cpu-flaws-mean-cryptocurrency,"Recently leaked computer vulnerabilities Meltdown and Spectre offer yet another reminder of how hard the digital age makes it to keep private information – even cryptocurrency private keys – safe.

Unveiled Wednesday, the widespread hardware vulnerabilities simultaneously impact Intel, ARM and AMD computer chips, which power the vast majority of the world’s computers, mobile devices and servers, making it possible to steal private data such as passwords, financial information or just about anything stored on any device that uses one of these chips.

Where this is important for cryptocurrency in particular is, hackers can potentially use the specific attack vector to pinch the private keys that allow users to control their bitcoins on the blockchain.

Popular Mechanics called it a “horrific” bug, contending it’s “hard to zero in on the most troubling part of this flaw,” while an informational page authored by security researchers remarks that you’re “most certainly” impacted by the bug.

And though there’s no evidence that any passwords have been compromised, experts say it wouldn’t be surprising if hackers or the NSA have been exploiting the attack.

If you’re already following best practices for cryptocurrency storage, then you’re probably fine. But if not, or if you’re a newer user, experts say it’s important to keep private keys on a safe device.

“Better safe than sorry,” said Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk, adding:

“An attacker who has knowledge of a sufficiently powerful vulnerability can theoretically force your CPU to reveal secret data such as private keys used to control your bitcoin.”

Attack vectors

It’s important to note that the advice to store private keys on a secure device is nothing new. (Crypto developers have long warned against storing private keys on laptops or other devices that interact with the internet.)

But the reasons why might not be obvious for newer users. Even though bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are secure protocols, they must interact with the open internet and regular computers. In short, storing private keys so close to the internet can potentially expose users to hacks and theft.

And the new CPU vulnerabilities make the situation even worse, as a chain of actions can lead to error and compromise.

“If the protected memory problem is real, then a browser plugin or even a website may access your private keys,” said Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli.

The full details of the issue aren’t yet public, so it’s unclear what the precise attack vectors are. Still, others suggested a similar impact could be likely.

“To get hit by this attack, all you would have to do is click a link by accident and maybe you end up on a website that serves a bad ad with the malware code that steals your data,” Bishop added.

And while these scenarios might sound far-fetched, most of today’s malware prey on similar vulnerabilities that have yet to be patched. It’s just impossible to know who and when they’ll actually hit.

Operating system fixes are now available that users should use to patch up their Windows, Mac, and Linux devices. But, for cryptocurrency users, the better option is not to store private keys on an internet-connected device at all, a recommendation common far before this particular vulnerability.

One option is to store private keys on a so-called “hardware wallet,” such as Ledger or Trezor. The small devices might not be quite as easy to use, but they are more secure in that their not connected to the internet.

Pavol Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs, the company behind Trezor, went as far as to argue “Using a [hardware] wallet is now more important than ever!” While ethereum developer Lefteris Karapetsas quipped, “I bet Spectre and Meltdown is the best thing that could have happened for cryptocurrency cold wallet businesses.”

Exchange treasure troves

Beyond solo consumer devices, a much bigger, more worrying target is cryptocurrency exchanges and businesses, which store cryptocurrency private keys for millions of users at once.

Some cryptocurrency exchanges use cloud hosting services such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud to run their websites, rather than spin up their own servers.

While these platforms make websites easier to manage, they are particularly vulnerable to these attacks. A hacker could theoretically spin up a server using the same hardware as a cryptocurrency startup running operations on such a cloud platform and suddenly have access to all of their data.

In the crypto world, a hacker could hypothetically use this attack vector to steal private keys.

On the one hand, many of the most popular cloud platforms quickly unrolled fixes. On the other hand, researchers worry that deep-rooted vulnerabilities could spawn unfixed variants, with possible lingering effects to come.

Ripple has arrived in 2018 by grabbing headlines, mostly down to optimism from mainstream banks that - unlike bitcoin, with its links to the Dark Web and terrorism - offers blockchain technology without the accompanying bad press. Ripple or XRP has a market capitalisation of $112billion, having overtaken Ethereum earlier this year. It now sits second only to bitcoin’s market capitalisation of $225billion and has gained more than 45,700 percent over the last 12 months. Express.co.uk spoke to asset manager Levi Meade, Lead Investment Analyst at Columbus Capital about the many differences in the “protocols” of the new offerings and why this is important in understanding their move towards mainstream adoption. Mr Meade says that, although Bitcoin cash, Ethereum and Ripple are all referred to as cryptocurrencies, they are very difference animals and not necessarily in direct competition with one another.

While legacy Bitcoin has attracted much attention in late 2017, Bitcoin Cash has been quietly gaining traction. Jimmy Nguyen, nChain

Bitcoin Cash, Mr Meade says, was created on the basis of becoming a global currency, with Bitcoin only more recently seeming to be a potential safe haven asset or store of wealth. In terms of payment, both bitcoin and bitcoin cash have been built to allow the simple A to B transfer of value as the application. Ethereum, on the other hand is referred to as a smart contract platform. Mr Meade adds: “This was built with the purpose of extending the programmability of money, which simply means that much more complicated transactions than simple A to B transfers can take place when utilising the capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain.” The asset manager presents an example, when he said: “Perhaps you would like to do a transaction with another person or company that has certain criteria to be met which affects the timing and amount of a payment or even perhaps stream of payments. “With this is mind, rather than aiming to become a world currency, Ethereum has the potential to be a fundamental piece of architecture behind the next generation of the Web and smart devices, handling all aspects of value transfer natively to these systems.”

Finally, the Ripple blockchain again differs to an even greater extent to bitcoin than Ethereum. The asset manager says that while the name of the game for bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum is “disruption” of the financial world. He said: “Ripple is a blockchain solution that can best be described as a massive infrastructure upgrade to the world of finance bringing value transfer into the digital age. “The Ripple blockchain seeks to replace existing payment rails that connect Banks, Payment providers, Corporates and exchanges in order to provide quite dramatic savings in costs and time.” But which of these offering is most likely to challenge bitcoin’s hegemony as the number one cryptocurrency? None of them, according to Mr Meade. He added: “It is certainly not the case that Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum or Ripple are directly chasing bitcoin.

South Korea, among others, is considering a ban on trading with virtual cryptocurrency operators that are not regulated by local authorities.

Here are some of the traditional banks and exchange operators that allow you to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Switzerland

In August 2017, the Falcon Private Bank announced that it was the first Swiss private bank to provide blockchain asset management for its clients.

The Swiss bank headquartered in Zurich allows its clients to trade in Bitcoin (XBT), Etheruem (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

The Swissquote bank based in Gland, also started trading in cryptocurrencies in 2017.

Customers of the bank can trade in Bitcoin, Etheruem, Litecoin, Ripple (XRP) and Bitcoin Cash.

IG Bank started trading with cryptocurrencies in 2017. Customers can use it to buy Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

United States

In December 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) became the first US-based exchange to offer Bitcoin Futures based on the Bitcoin price on the Gemini virtual exchange.

As described by CBOE, Bitcoin futures are legal agreements that stipulate the price at which parties will trade Bitcoin on a specified date in the future. Each futures agreement is stipulated with an expiration date anywhere from a week out to nine or more months.

At the futures contract due date, Bitcoin futures are settled based on the official auction price for Bitcoin on the Gemini Exchange on that day.

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) became the second exchange to offer Bitcoin trading on December 2017.

The following public exchanges do not yet offer trade in Bitcoin, but reportedly have plans to do so in 2018:

The Nasdaq Stock Market plans to launch a futures contract based on Bitcoin in 2018, making it the third exchange operator to offer Bitcoin contracts in the US.

The New York Stock Exchange is planning to dive into the cryptocurrency market. In December it asked the US Securities and Exchange commission for approval to list two Bitcoin futures on its market.

Bitcoin ATMs

The world’s first Bitcoin ATM opened on 2013 at the Waves Coffee House in downtown Vancouver, Canada.

The internet-connected machines look like traditional ATMs but they are not connected to a bank account and instead simply allow users to connect to a virtual Bitcoin exchange.

Users insert cash, buy Bitcoins online, and receive Bitcoin as a paper receipt.

There are over 2,000 Bitcoin ATMs and tellers around the world, according to the Bitcoin ATM Radar website.

Virtual exchanges

Popular virtual Bitcoin exchange operators include Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, Coincheck, and Kraken.

Hacking risk. Over 36 dedicated exchange operators have closed down in recent years. The latest was South Korea’s You.Bit exchange on December 19, which filed for bankruptcy after it was hacked for the second time this year.

Over $70 million worth of Bitcoin has reportedly been lost after hackers targeted several cryptocurrency exchanges.

Read: Bitcoin starts 2018 by tumbling",,https://qz.com/1160667/the-secret-lives-of-students-who-mine-cryptocurrency-in-their-dorm-rooms/,"Mark was a sophomore at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts, when he began mining cryptocurrencies more or less by accident.

In November 2016, he stumbled on NiceHash, an online marketplace for individuals to mine cryptocurrency for willing buyers. His desktop computer, boosted with a graphics card, was enough to get started. Thinking he might make some money, Mark, who asked not to use his last name, downloaded the platform’s mining software and began mining for random buyers in exchange for payments in bitcoin. Within a few weeks, he had earned back the $120 cost of his graphics card, as well as enough to buy another for $200.

From using NiceHash, he switched to mining ether, then the most popular bitcoin alternative. To increase his computational power, he scrounged up several unwanted desktop computers from a professor who “seemed to think that they were awful and totally trash.” When equipped with the right graphics cards, the “trash” computers worked fine.

Each time Mark mined enough ether to cover the cost, he bought a new graphics card, trading leftover currency into bitcoin for safekeeping. By March 2017, he was running seven computers, mining ether around the clock from his dorm room. By September his profits totaled one bitcoin—worth roughly $4,500 at the time. Now, four months later, after bitcoin’s wild run and the diversification of his cryptocoin portfolio, Mark estimates he has $20,000 in digital cash. “It just kind of blew up,” he says.

Mark Four of Mark’s desktop computer miners.

Exploiting a crucial competitive advantage and motivated by profit and a desire to learn the technology, students around the world are launching cryptocurrency mining operations right from their dorm rooms. In a typical mining operation, electricity consumption accounts for the highest fraction of operational costs, which is why the largest bitcoin mines are based in China. But within Mark’s dorm room, MIT foots the bill. That gives him and other student miners the ability to earn higher profit margins than most other individual miners.

In the months since meeting Mark, I’ve interviewed seven other miners from the US, Canada, and Singapore who ran or currently run dorm room cryptomining operations, and I’ve learned of many more who do the same. Initially, almost every student began mining because it was fun, cost-free, and even profitable. As their operations grew, so did their interest in cryptocurrency and in blockchain, the underlying technology. Mining, in other words, was an unexpected gateway into discovering a technology that many predict will dramatically transform our lives.

While it’s impossible to estimate how many dorm room cryptominers exist globally, it’s likely their numbers are growing as cryptocurrency values continue to balloon. Once they graduate, these students are poised to play a critical role in shaping the next technology revolution.

A dorm room operation

Years before meeting Mark, when I was a junior at MIT, I had heard rumors of my peers mining bitcoin. After its value exploded, and along with it, the necessary computational and electrical power to mine it, I assumed that dorm room mining was no longer viable. What I hadn’t considered was the option of mining alternate cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, which can and do thrive as small-scale operations.

When mining for cryptocurrency, computational power, along with low power costs, is king. Miners around the world compete to solve math problems for a chance to earn digital coins. The more computational power you have, the greater your chances of getting returns.

The more computational power you have, the greater your chances of getting returns.

To profitably mine bitcoin today, you need an application-specific integrated circuit, or ASIC—specialized hardware designed for bitcoin-mining efficiency. An ASIC can have 100,000 times more computational power than a standard desktop computer equipped with a few graphics cards. But ASICs are expensive—the most productive ones easily cost several thousands of dollars—and they suck power. If bitcoin prices aren’t high enough to earn more revenue than the cost of electricity, the pricey hardware cannot be repurposed for any other function.

In contrast, alternate currencies like ethereum are “ASIC-resistant,” because ASICS designed to mine ether don’t exist. That means ether can be profitably mined with just a personal computer. Rather than rely solely on a computer’s core processor (colloquially called a “CPU”), however, miners pair it with graphics cards (“GPUs”) to increase the available computational power. Whereas CPUs are designed to solve one problem at a time, GPUs are designed to simultaneously solve hundreds. The latter dramatically raises the chances of getting coins.

Mark Another desktop computer miner that sits on Mark’s desk and doubles as his computer for work.

Most of the dorm room miners I spoke to mined alternative currencies with personal computers and graphics cards. Some used their desktops, while others built their own computers. A few of them even used their laptops. Pretty much everyone already had graphics cards for gaming or other purposes before realizing that they met the hardware requirements for mining.

“It just so happened that at the time I was reading up on mining, I was building a personal computer for purposes of video editing…some AI stuff, and whatever I throw at it,” says Arjun Singh Brar, a recent graduate of Singapore University of Technology and Design. With access to his dorm’s free electricity, he thought, “Why don’t I just give [mining] a try.”

Free electricity and massive amounts of heat

By Mark’s estimation, four of the other 35 residents on his floor also have homegrown rigs. Unlike his setup, most just use a single desktop with one or two graphics cards.

None of them really know what MIT’s policy is on their profit-generating activities, so they take precautions to avoid getting caught. “I have a lot of experience with exactly what outlets in my room can pull what amounts of current before I trip the breaker,” Mark says. He knows it trips if he ever overclocks any one of his computers by running its CPU at a faster speed than it was designed for. That causes his entire operation to shut down, which could draw the scrutiny of the university’s facilities department. (MIT did not respond to request for comment.)

“All chocolate I accidentally leave here melts, but it’s not horribly uncomfortable.”

So far, everyone on Mark’s floor has flown under the radar. MIT monitors electricity use by building rather than by individual, and the miners almost certainly don’t pull enough power to make their dorm’s electricity use look anomalous. All of the other miners I spoke to had similar experiences; (SUTD and Stanford did not respond to requests for comment. Babson College said it didn’t “have anything to add on this subject.”)

1 On the question of whether mining cryptocurrency for profit should be allowed in dorm rooms, Andrew Sellars, the director of Boston University’s Technology & Cyberlaw Clinic, says he “would venture to guess most universities, if not all universities, have not thought about this question at all or perhaps only very generally.” There are technically no legal ramifications for dorm room mining, he says. Most universities have a non-solicitation policy that prevents students from doing business out of their dorms, which could be stretched to apply to this scenario, but Sellars doesn’t think universities have a strong incentive to crackdown. “Dorm rooms are kind of a funny space,” he says. Even though universities own them and are in charge of their students’ health and safety, they must also afford their students a degree of autonomy as arbiters of the bridge from childhood to adulthood.

Mark figures the university owes him, anyway. “The only thing that I’m concerned about is if somebody at MIT comes after me for unnecessarily using their electricity, which I think is kind of silly considering to go here,” he says. James Spann, a sophomore at the Rochester Institute of Technology who also mines crypto, echoed Mark’s reasoning: “The electricity and internet are part of the tuition.”

2 The estimated cost of attendance for undergraduates at MIT is $67,430 for the 2017-2018 school year.

What dorm miners don’t pay for in electricity, they pay for in discomfort. Even without the radiator running in the middle of a Boston winter, the temperature in Mark’s room is well above desirable. His rig is “essentially a 2,000-watt heater running at all times,” Mark says. “All chocolate I accidentally leave here melts, but it’s not horribly uncomfortable.” This is even after he moved his two most efficient mining rigs to his girlfriend’s room three floors below because the heat in the summer was unbearable.

Other miners described how they handled the massive amounts of heat—and what their significant others and roommates put up with. Rahul, a Stanford class of 2015 electrical engineer, drew his girlfriend’s ire for his rig. “It was very loud and blew a lot of hot air. My girlfriend was very upset that it had to be on at night,” he laughs.

Nicholas Abouzeid The computer Abouzeid built to mine bitcoin.

When Nicholas Abouzeid, a senior at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, began mining from home in high school, he ran the software off his Macbook Pro and kept his bedroom window open to regulate his laptop’s temperature. “It would get to 35 degrees in my room, and I was shivering in bed, but my computer was very happy,” he says. A few months before leaving for college, when he built his own computer to mine crypto more efficiently, he surrounded it with fans to disperse the heat.

Patrick Cines, a recent college graduate who mined in his dorm room at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania, was particularly innovative. To regulate his room’s temperature in the August heat without air conditioning, he hacked together a ventilation solution out of Home Depot dryer tubes. “The ones that people usually connect to their dryers in their houses to put out all the heat,” he explains.

Patrick Cines Cines’ rig used giant dryer tubes from Home Depot to funnel the hot air out of his room.

Fast gains and faster losses

In the fast-paced, unregulated world of crypto, a fortune gained one day can be quickly lost the next, not just because of the market’s high volatility. Lack of regulation increases susceptibility to fraud and security breaches.

On Dec. 6 last year, for example, hackers penetrated NiceHash, the platform that introduced Mark to mining, and whisked away 4,736.42 bitcoin, worth more than $60 million based on the day-of price. Mark had returned to NiceHash after mining ether, but fortunately only lost roughly $300 of unpaid bitcoin. He immediately switched to using a different cryptomining marketplace. NiceHash froze its operations for two weeks.

“I got burned.”

While Mark’s encounter with bad actors left him relatively unscathed, Rahul, the Stanford graduate, suffered a much greater loss. In December, 2013, he spent a couple thousand dollars on an ASIC to mine bitcoin. Within the first three months, he mined what was at the time worth $10,000, he says. (According to CoinDesk, the price of bitcoin during that time averaged around $800.) Confident that the price would rise, he purchased another $10,000 of bitcoin with his own money and placed all of his holdings on Mt. Gox, then the largest and most trusted bitcoin exchange in the world.

In February of 2014, Mt. Gox got hacked and lost 740,000 bitcoins. The Japanese exchange declared bankruptcy and Rahul lost every penny. Despite joining the subsequent class action lawsuit, he told me he still hasn’t seen any of his investment returned.

“Our BTC, plus the additional investments we made, would have been worth well over six figures at today’s prices,” he says. “I got burned.”

Ahead of the curve

Though dorm room mining may seem trivial, it’s creating a new generation of cryptocurrency experts. Many miners say their experiences taught them crucial lessons about the technology, and some have already substantially profited as well.

Abouzeid at Babson, for example, was introduced to crypto in December 2013 while he was still a junior in high school. His friend showed him the lighthearted, meme-obsessed subreddit for dogecoin, a new bitcoin alternative, named after the viral doge meme. “I was like, ‘Oh this is fun and kind of silly. I’ll buy in,'” he says.

He began dabbling with mining doge (the dogecoin unit of currency) on his Macbook Pro. In January 2014, the subreddit pooled together $30,000, or 26.5 million doge, to send the Jamaican bobsled team to the Sochi Winter Olympics. Two months later, it pooled together $55,000, over 100 million doge, to sponsor a driver in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race. Both stunts made Abouzeid realize the power of crypto.

“Now I can look back and go, ‘Wow look, I know more about bitcoin than most people!'”

Invigorated, he dug into understanding bitcoin and built his first specialized mining computer at home. “It ran for three months until my mother got our electricity bill,” he says. Once he arrived at Babson, the university’s free electricity gave him unfettered freedom to dive deep into the crypto world.

“I don’t know if I could justify my interest in it initially,” he says. “Of course now I can look back and go, ‘Wow look, I know more about bitcoin than most people! This is totally a good investment.’ But at first it was just fun.” The experience has inspired him to work in the industry in the future.

Akash Nath, a class of 2016 Boston University graduate, began a bitcoin derivatives trading platform called Alt-Options with a few other classmates several months after he began mining in his dorm room as a sophomore. He and the other founders sold the company for an undisclosed amount in April 2016, earning a neat return before even graduating from college. ”It worked out pretty nicely,” he says.

Now 23, Nath runs a company unrelated to crypto, but maintains his network in the crypto and blockchain community. If he returns to the crypto world, he plans to educate new users. There are “very few clear resources to properly direct and educate newcomers,” he says.

An impending revolution

No one yet fully understands how cryptocurrencies will change how we transact business with one another, but many experts predict they will spark a revolution. That thinking was reflected in 2017 when bitcoin’s price rose 1,000%, yet still fell short of the top 10 cryptocurrency gainers of the year; when Estonia announced that it would pursue plans to launch a crypto-token, making it the first country to do so; and when major Japanese and South Korean banks began trialing blockchain-based payments (paywall).

“I fundamentally believe that blockchain technologies are going to improve the world,” says Abouzeid. “I don’t know when, I don’t know how. I don’t know if it’s going to be bitcoin or ethereum or whatever coin is coming up today or tomorrow, but I enjoy it and it’s fun.

“It’s fun to be part of the ride.”",,https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-crypto-ecosystem-pagarex-release-set-evolve-crypto-world/,"PR: Crypto Ecosystem PagareX Release Set to Evolve the Crypto World

This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.

A new product in the cryptocurrency world is ready to launch in the form of PagareX. This launch aims to provide both crypto-education and multiple investment opportunities in order to empower people financially. In doing so, the PagareX aims to cater to the cryptocurrency masses throughout the world and become the leading crypto-community by the year of 2020. So, how will it do this?

The PAGAREX has been designed in order to reduce – and potentially eliminate – the dependency on centralised banking and financial institutions, thereby granting financial freedom to crypto users. Furthermore, identity theft and other connected issues with fiat currencies will be all but eliminated due to the security level of this cryptocurrency. Users of PagareX will also find themselves being able to connect socially and financially to a vast community of investors and lenders. As the cryptocurrency price increases, anyone using PGX will be able to increase the value of their coins in the wallets.

The PagareX release will promote storing and investing consumer wealth, which will occur in a non-government controlled, safe and secure currency. Anyone possessing the PagareX within their wallet will receive interest on their balance. What else will holders be able to do with PagareX though?

Buying and Using PGX

Purchasing the PGX coins will allow you to start lending. Lending with PagareX will provide users with daily profit on top, which is dependent on the investment option taken. Users will then receive their capital back once the investment term ends. It’s then possible to withdraw this from the PagareX lending platform or reinvest it back in to continue receiving daily profit. This works by holders of PagareX lending out to software which has been designed to purchase Bitcoin when the price is low and sell it when the price is high. Any profit is then split between users and the software.

Mining will also be possible to users, with developers of this product designing its algorithm to resist the development of custom mining hardware. All transactions will be validated by a widely distributed network. This means that selling pressure will not be a factor when large mining pools end up flooding the market with fresh coins. The PGX coin will also be minable from any device, including computers, tablets and smartphones.

Because the PagareX network is run by holders of the PGX, the revenues that it generates are given out to stakers. This is solely to reward them for the protection and maintenance of the network. With this being the case, the more users owning PGX, the more mining power they have. As a result – bigger profits will be made.

An additional possibility for users of PagareX will include the refer and affiliate program. Through this, further PGX coins can be earned by referring people to our community. The PagareX platform will also offer a unique bonus scheme giving users the potential to earn more for every new user they refer.

In a global survey of 672 active Bitcoin investors, researchers asked traders the method they used to fund their cryptocurrency trading accounts. The majority of investors used banking systems such as credit cards and ACH transfers to fund their accounts.

But 22 percent of traders revealed that they have not paid off their credit and debit cards after purchasing Bitcoin, effectively investing in the cryptocurrency with borrowed money. The report read:

“The wisest and most frugal way to fund a virtual currency exchange account would be through an ACH transfer, which is completely free of charge. Only 18.60 percent of our 672 Bitcoin-invested respondents were paying for the cryptocurrency in this fashion. However, this was not even the most pressing concern coming from the LendEDU poll. That recognition belongs to this data-point: 22.13 percent of Bitcoin investors did not pay off their credit card balance after purchasing Bitcoin.”

Exaggerated generalization

Lately, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, revealed that it has been adding more than 250,000 active users on a daily basis, and were forced to stop adding new users temporarily as a result. Coinbase and Bitstamp have also been adding more than 100,000 users per day and at the time of reporting, Coinbase has close to 20 mln users.

In early December, Bitstamp Co-founder and CEO Nejc Kodrič stated:

“Please understand that we currently have over 100,000 new accounts opened daily. It is challenging to cope with such surge. We are expanding our capacity to onboard clients faster, but this takes a bit of time.”

Hence, 618 Bitcoin users, is nowhere sufficient to create generalizations about the entire global Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market.

But, it is important to acknowledge that a small portion of Bitcoin investors are still trading the cryptocurrency with debt to this date, despite the advice of experts and analysts to refrain from doing so.

Only invest amount that can be lost

In June, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos strongly emphasized that he only invests an amount in cryptocurrencies that he is willing to lose, given the significant risk involved in cryptocurrency trading. While the risk of investing in Bitcoin is lower than others given the size of its market, the risk for other cryptocurrencies in the global market still remains substantially high.

“I own a few different crypto assets as part of a small but diversified portfolio. I only risk as much as I'm willing to lose,” said Antonopoulos.

In a presentation at Coinscrum, an event hosted by the Imperial College London, Antonopoulos also noted that he can lose all of his investments in cryptocurrencies and still have everything else because he has invested his career, intellectual capacity, and work in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.

For casual investors and newcomers, it is extremely risky to obtain debt to invest in a particular asset and this is not exclusive to Bitcoin. It does not matter which asset it is, becoming in debt to invest in a particular asset or asset class is highly risky.

""My small savings that I do have are invested in Bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I'm still trying to pay off, so it is more than 100 percent in Bitcoin. Now, I'd like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven't invested my money in Bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in Bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in Bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I'd still have everything else,” Antonopoulos explained.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/exponential-growth-cryptocurrency-exchanges-are-adding-100000-users-per-day,"Major Bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading platforms within the global market have been adding more than 100,000 users per day.

Many of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase (GDAX), Binance, Bittrex, Bitstamp and Kraken have struggled in dealing with the abrupt surge in demand for cryptocurrencies. Some exchanges have overhauled their systems to improve their scalability, while others have temporarily stopped opening new user accounts.

Unexpected growth rate

This week, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, the global market’s largest cryptocurrency exchange with a staggering $9.5 bln daily trading volume, revealed that it has added more than 250,000 users on a single day.

“Sorry guys, servicing existing members is higher priority at this point. Full team working around the clock. Both tech and support. Just too much demand. Added 250,000 new users in the last 24 hours,” said Zhao, referencing the official statement released by the company.

On Jan. 4, Binance stated, “due to the overwhelming surge in popularity, Binance will have to temporarily disable new user registrations to allow for an infrastructure upgrade. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.”

In December, both Kraken and Coinbase allocated a significant portion of their resources and capital in improving customer support and the scalability of their platforms. On Dec. 23, Kraken, which has found difficulty in processing account verifications, disclosed that it has implemented major system upgrades and improvements in performance and will continue to develop its trading platform to support new users.

The Kraken development team admitted that its current infrastructure is “degraded and unreliable,” and vowed to improve it throughout January. The company said:

“We have made significant progress in the last week with the system upgrades and have realized moderate improvement in performance. Unfortunately, we were not able to complete all of the upgrades and the most impactful measures are yet to come. For the time being, systems should still be considered degraded and unreliable.”

Regional exchanges such as South Korea’s Bithumb, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of daily trading volume, have also stopped accepting new users.

Why are large exchanges struggling?

In late 2017, South Korea’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange Korbit was acquired at a valuation of $140 mln by a $10 bln gaming giant in Nexon. Given the size and the market valuation of Korbit, major exchanges like Bithumb, Bitstamp, Kraken and Binance could be worth more than $1 bln, as Coinbase was valued at $1.6 bln in its latest funding round.

Even with such large market valuation, high-profit margins, and many resources, cryptocurrency exchanges are struggling to address the exponentially increasing demand from investors because of the strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems the companies were forced to implement by the authorities.

Each user application must be manually approved and verified. The failure to segregate fraudulent accounts from legitimate users could result in large fines and lawsuits for exchanges. Consequently, the vetting process of users is rigorous and requires significant efforts from the employees of exchanges.

Given that exchanges are adding more than 100,000 users per day, it is likely that exchanges are also receiving more than one mln trading account approval requests per month, at least.

That is, if the approval process of accounts take around 10 minutes per account, 166,666 hours on a monthly basis that employees have to cover manually.

In the next few months, global cryptocurrency exchanges will make drastic changes to their systems. Until then, users, especially newcomers, will find it difficult to open approved trading accounts.",,https://qz.com/1174091/china-wants-an-orderly-exit-from-bitcoin-mining/,"New technology is upending everything in finance, from saving to trading to making payments.

Bitcoin mining could be on its last legs in China.

The country’s top internet-finance regulator, the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, issued a notice asking local governments to “guide” bitcoin-mining operations to make an “orderly exit” from the business, according to a leaked document online. Citing government sources, Bloomberg and Reuters earlier reported that China is planning to limit electricity supply to bitcoin miners.

“Currently, there are some so-called ‘mining’ enterprises that produce ‘virtual currencies.’ They have consumed huge amounts of resources and stoked speculation of ‘virtual currencies,’” according to the document dated Jan. 2.

The document, issued to local offices of the internet-finance regulator, asks local authorities to use measures linked to electricity price, land use, tax, and environmental protection, among other things, to guide bitcoin miners to quit the business. It also asks the local offices to report information about mining facilities in their regions, as well as the progress of the exits from mining by Jan. 10, and then on the tenth day of every month.

Calls to the contact number on the document went unanswered.

Also leaked online was a separate document from the internet-finance regulator’s Xinjiang office, dated Jan. 4. The document asks the local authority in the western region to report miners’ exit progress by the fifth day of each month. It also cited concerns over energy usage and speculation as in the national-level document.

When reached by Quartz in a phone call, Zhang Qiubin from the Xinjiang office confirmed the authenticity of the local document, but refused to comment on the national-level one. But both documents note that the regulatory decisions on bitcoin mining were made during a November meeting between the internet-finance regulator and its local branches.

The Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation was set up by China’s cabinet in 2016, with Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the Chinese central bank, as its head. Pan said in December that the central bank has made the right decisions in banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) and shutting down local cryptocurrency exchanges. He also predicted the death of bitcoin.

China accounts for more than two-thirds of the world’s processing power devoted to bitcoin mining. It’s also home to some of the world’s leading creators of mining hardware, which usually also operate large mining pools—groups of miners who agree to add up their resources to improve their odds of finding bitcoin.

The latest crackdown on bitcoin mining comes amid China’s efforts to better distribute electricity to places where power is undersupplied. Bitcoin miners have taken advantage of cheap power in coal-abundant areas like Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia in recent years to expand their operations.

It’s also worth noting that Beijing worries about social chaos triggered by small investors who lose money investing in risky financial products, and has cracked down on investment vehicles like peer-to-peer lending and online insurance. Shutting down crypto exchanges would be on its own insufficient to curtail the hype around bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as the documents indicate.

Already, some of the biggest bitcoin miners in China are moving operations overseas, with the US and Canada among popular options. But still, industrial players have doubts over how effective the state crackdown could be: For one thing, local governments have strong incentives to keep big mining firms running in their localities, given the huge tax and electricity bills they pay. An employee with Beijing-based Bitmain, which runs some of the world’s largest mining facilities, told Quartz that the company hasn’t heard anything from the Xinjiang government regarding its mining operations there.

As to mining farms owned by smaller players, especially those in the mountainous areas of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, simply locating the miners is a near impossible task. A growing number of private owners of hydropower plants in the two regions have begun to operate mining machines themselves as the price of bitcoin has surged, Du Jun, founder of Node Capital, a Beijing-based venture-capital firm focusing on the blockchain industry, told Quartz prior to news of the latest crackdown. “How can you find them?” he asks.",,https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/07/the-cryptocurrency-bubble-is-strangling-innovation/,"Sure, fine, maybe it’s a bubble. OK it’s definitely a bubble, but that’s a good thing, a bubble brings attention and investment in infrastructure, which breeds real innovation. Right? Look at the dot-com boom. A lot of people lost a whole lot of paper money, but it brought us a cheap worldwide fiber backbone and companies like Amazon and Google. Today’s crypto bubble is just like that. Right?

…So goes the theory, by which I mean, desperate rationalization. And it was somewhat true, for a while; but not any more. Cryptocurrencies have now ascended to speculative values that actually preclude any non-speculative uses. They have become so expensive that they are preventing innovation.

Most “crypto tokens” are, in fact, just glorified hash values stored on the Ethereum blockchain — literally nothing more than a table of numbers like “address A: 10,000. address B: 20,000,” wrapped in standard blocks of code (the ERC20 and ERC721 standards, for fungible and non-fungible tokens respectively) so that they can be easily transacted.

…Which means that every transfer of such tokens requires a transaction to be performed on the Ethereum blockchain. And as the price of ether has skyrocketed — to more than $1,000 as I write this — transaction fees have done so as well, so that the average fee for an Ethereum transaction is now around US$2.50.

(Ethereum’s variable-gas-price mechanism doesn’t really help; fees are driven by supply and demand. And of course it’s not just Ethereum. Blockstack’s DNS uses the Bitcoin blockchain as its source of truth, and Bitcoin transaction costs have also gone through the roof. SegWit transactions are cheaper / more efficient but that’s noise compared to the overall trend.)

This is fine if you’re just speculating, trading hundreds/thousands of dollars worth of tokens at a time. But it is crippling if you’re actually trying to build an app that people use for anything else.

If you’re trying to build a decentralized name / identity service … your names now cost more than many top-level Internet domains that automatically resolve in browsers. If your tokens represent ownership of virtual entities, or access to decentralized storage … suddenly just using the token at all, never mind transferring the value associated with the tokens, makes your cost structure somewhere between punitive and prohibitive.

So if you’re trying to build anything even remotely high-volume atop an Ethereum token — forget it. Your entire business model is catastrophically doomed at today’s prices. (Ethereum’s “sender-pays” model doesn’t help either, although that’s due to change sometime soonish.) Only very-low-volume, very-high-value applications need apply. Like the current wave of speculation.

As a result, entire categories of cryptocurrency experimentation and innovation are on hold until the bubble bursts, or until / unless Ethereum finds a way to scale such that transaction fees plummet. Oh, people can still write and deploy code. But nobody will use it. Curious would-be users will be repelled by the nontrivial expense of mere experimentation, never mind ongoing usage.

So developers won’t be able to find real-world users, and get any feedback from real-world use; they won’t discover any emergent properties; and nobody will use and then iterate on their work. That whole continent of the blockchain ecosystem is now essentially in a deep freeze, covered by glaciers.

It remains an open question whether even much, much lower fees would be viable in the long run. Proponents of micropayments don’t seem to realize that the fundamental problem with micropayments is not their cost, or the absence of supporting infrastructure; it’s the cognitive load that they induce. Parker Thompson of AngelList argues that fee-free decentralized apps are the only ones which might possibly succeed in consumer markets, and I think he’s right, but that raises the question of how you prioritize and prevent spam blockchain transactions in the absence of fees.

Today that’s a moot point, though. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not saying the sky is falling, the feepocalypse is upon us, and every decentralized application is doomed forevermore. A lot of interesting work and research has in fact been done regarding scaling Ethereum: sharding, Raiden, Plasma. Hopes for them remain justifiably high.

But until and unless they roll out, and/or the cryptocurrency markets stop being voting machines and start being weighing machines, most non-speculative token projects are doomed to indefinite hibernation. If you care about actual innovation, the inevitable popping of today’s bubble won’t mark the onset of crypto winter; rather, it will bring a crypto spring.",2018-01-07,https://cointelegraph.com/news/combined-crypto-market-capitalization-races-past-800-bln,"The combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies hit $800 bln on Sunday, just days after reaching the previous all-time high of $700 bln. The number is at over $825 bln as of press time and keeps growing.

Following a two-day period of sharp decline just before the New Year, the majority of cryptocurrencies are now growing again, contributing to the rapid increase in the combined market capitalization.

The latest all-time high comes just under a month after the market has achieved a total capitalization of $500 bln. This immense growth, coupled with the fact that 2017 started at a mere $18 bln combined, seems to indicate that cryptocurrency is well on its way to becoming a trillion-dollar industry.

Speaking of individual coins that are driving this upward dynamic, several are of note. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is hovering at a relatively stable price range between $16,500 and $17,000, with slight growth over the past week. However, the share of its capitalization against that of the market as a whole is still at all-time lows of around 34 percent, as major competitors seem to be outpacing it.

Ethereum, for example, has surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time this Friday and keeps growing. Among the likely reasons for this dynamic is the immense level of adoption of the cryptocurrency, which seems to be higher than that of the rest of the market combined.

Ripple is another major producer of growth on the market. It started skyrocketing in mid-December 2017 and has already managed to displace Ethereum as the second-highest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, making its own chairman potentially the richest person on the planet in the process.

However, even if you disregard the major players, there are a lot of factors as to why the numbers are growing so fast. When even meme coins are reaching billion-dollar capitalizations, countries are issuing their own cryptocurrencies, and prominent tech CEOs like Thiel and Zuckerberg are eyeing the industry, a trillion-dollar combined market cap can easily seem a distinct possibility.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-tax-tips-to-start-2018-right,"Even though cryptocurrencies are getting more and more exposure, their legislation seems to be a grey area for most governments, especially when it comes to declaring your income in digital currencies. The Internal Revenue Service, the US tax collection agency, has issued Notice 2014-21 stating that Bitcoin and altcoins are subjects to federal income and payroll taxes. So what to do with your crypto money and how to declare your taxes right?

Records

Let’s start with the dreary subject of records. Yes, that applies to crypto investors too. You’d better have some if you are thinking about taxes. If you’ve ever tried to tell the IRS “I lost my receipt,” you don’t want to do it a second time.

The IRS has heard every excuse in the book. While it is not without sympathy, you’ll find it far easier not having to go to the additional effort of proving something by another means. Periodically, the IRS issues reminders to taxpayers regarding the importance of safeguarding your tax records.

That’s especially true in cases of natural disasters that make traditional record-keeping go haywire. But think of it year-round wherever you are. The IRS suggests creating a backup set of records stored away from the originals. It is good advice for crypto investors.

Selling some assets?

If you are sitting on some big gains, you might consider how your tax picture will look for the entire year. It isn’t too soon to start thinking this way. In fact, try to do it long before year-end so you can make adjustments. You might want to sell or hedge some, even if you think the market is still headed up.

There is a lot more than taxes involved in such decisions. But it can be wise to at least think about it. For example, what if your tax year already has a big capital loss in it, or you have a big carryover loss from prior years? In general, unused capital losses can be used to absorb up to $3,000 per year in ordinary income.

But unless you have capital gains to offset your capital losses that $3,000 would be the extent of your tax benefit. Some people sit for years and years with unused capital losses that carryover each year. So, if you also have unrealized capital gains, you might consider selling some gain assets, to be able to absorb your losses. Run some numbers and see how it looks.

And what exactly are you selling?

Another topic as tax time nears is to ask whether you really know what you are selling. That is, if you have 100 Bitcoins and you sell 10, which 10 did you sell? There is no perfect answer to this question. Most of the tax law considers shares of stock, not cryptocurrency.

However, many advisers think that the same kinds of rules should be applied in the case of multiple crypto assets that you hold. If so, specific identification of what you are selling, when you bought it, and for what purchase price, is likely to be the cleanest. But that may not be possible.

Some people use an averaging convention, where you essentially average your cost across a number of purchases. Consistency and record-keeping are important. You don’t want the IRS to claim that you denied the government its fair share of each sale. And remember, if you are claiming long-term capital gain treatment, being able to prove that you held the cryptocurrency for more than a year before selling is key.

Loans with interest and hedges

Loaning money shouldn’t be a taxable event to either the borrower or the lender, except for interest payments. So, can you loan out your cryptocurrency to people? You can, but the question is whether that loan will be treated the same as a loan of money by the IRS.

The jury is still out on that question. The IRS says cryptocurrency is property for tax purposes. You don’t want the loan and the repayment (of different cryptocurrency?) to be treated as taxable dispositions. Some of it may depend on your documents, and how much you make it look and feel like a real loan.

Hedges of cryptocurrency are another hot topic to consider. Hedges can help to avoid some of the volatility that has characterized the various crypto markets. But be careful that you are doing your best to avoid a disposition, meaning a sale for tax purposes, that you don’t want.

Gifts

The holidays may be over, but probably everyone in your family would still like some Bitcoin or other crypto issues. The prices have been so ever-present in the news, that gifts and donations are still very much in the news. But is it smart tax-wise?

A charitable contribution would be the best type of transfer. If you give to a qualified charity, you should get an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the crypto. If you bought for $500, and donate to a 501(c)(3) charity when it is worth $15,000, you should get a $15,000 charitable contribution deduction. What’s more, you won’t have to pay the capital gain tax on the $14,500 spread.

Giving to private parties is not as impressive. The same gift to your niece gets you no tax deduction. And it requires you to file a gift tax return since the gift is worth more than $15,000. For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called “annual exclusion” gifts you can give to any number of people each year with no reporting required.

Any gifts over that $15,000 amount require a gift tax return, even though you probably won’t pay any gift tax. You normally would use up a small portion of your lifetime exclusion from gift and estate tax. For 2018, that number just went up dramatically. The amount you can transfer tax-free during your life or on death just went up to $11.2 mln per person. That is $22.4 mln per married couple.

Forms 1099

Finally, don’t forget about the coming onslaught of IRS Forms 1099. Normally, these not-so-fun little tax forms arrive around the end of January, reporting income paid to you in the previous calendar tax year. The IRS says that wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.

Similarly, payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors are taxable to them, and payers who are engaged in business must issue Form 1099. A payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting just like any other payment made in property. That means if a person in business pays virtual currency worth $600 or more to an independent contractor for services, Form 1099 is required.

If you are a recipient of Form 1099, as most everyone is, keep track of them. Each one gets reported to the IRS and applicable state tax authorities. If you don’t report or otherwise address the reported income on your tax return, you can expect that the IRS will follow up.

This may seem confusing, but you shouldn’t worry. The IRS is usually much more lenient to those who fill in taxes, even with mistakes, rather than to those who avoid doing it at all.",,https://www.coindesk.com/regulatory-whack-mole-wont-beat-cryptocurrency-sanctions-evasion,"Bradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures, which works with a variety of startups in regulated industries and has holdings in Coinbase and Ripple.

Everyone saw this coming.

The New York Times reports that both the Russian and Venezuelan governments are trying to evade U.S. sanctions by creating new, state-sponsored cryptocurrencies that can avoid U.S. jurisdiction. Of course they are – that’s what rouge actors do. The question for us is how we deal with it.

There’s a cliché called “death by a thousand cuts.” In trying to resolve each specific problem only after it arises, eventually there are just too many wounds and the patient dies.

If the U.S. government just tries to go after each problematic example of crypto on an ad-hoc basis, that’s exactly what will happen (just like the War on Drugs has been a complete and utter failure) and it’ll never get ahead of the problem. That presents opportunity.

This is not the time to play whack-a-mole. This is the time to recognize that crypto is real and here to stay. It’s time to start forming sensible regulations to help govern the sector broadly and wisely.

What does that look like in practice? These are the first four steps we should consider:

Acknowledge the reality

First, our institutions need to realize that the more they try to deny the legitimacy of cryptocurrency, the more they inadvertently reinforce why it exists in the first place.

Trust in official institutions like government, organized religion, the media, and higher education are at an all-time low, all over the world. That’s why people want decentralized alternatives.

The more that top officials in the public and private sectors keep calling bitcoin a fad (or worse), the more they signal that they don’t get it.

No one knows for sure whether any specific currency will succeed or fail long-term, but I do know that crypto isn’t going away. The federal government needs to recognize this too.

Industry acceptance

Likewise, the industry needs to recognize that the institutions aren’t going away, either.

There are always bad actors in every sector and every walk of life. The public relies on government and the media to help separate the good from the bad.

Absent embracing some form of regulations, the bad guys like Russia and Venezuela (or sham initial coin offerings with no technological value) will drag everyone down.

Concrete steps forward

That’s why we need national regulations on crypto assets (a 50-state patchwork approach is a very predictable disaster).

We need to accept it as a new and permanent addition to the financial system.

And then we need to regulate it as such: bank charters, licenses, standards, best practices and reviews.

We have a slew of regulations to ensure that banks, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, mortgage lenders and a host of other financial institutions meet certain standards. Some of those regulations make sense. Others don’t. But we all agree we need some structure to provide guidance, direction and ensure good behavior (or at least try to).

The same applies here. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission should start working on what a national regulatory structure would look like and how it would work and the major players in the industry should eagerly volunteer to help provide ideas, advice, information and feedback.

Take it to the next level

Then it needs to go global.

Sure, between President Trump’s views on NATO, the U.N., NAFTA and free trade, this isn’t exactly a watershed moment for global cooperation. But for the very same reasons that bitcoin’s creation was fueled by a lack of faith in the financial system, if the standards governing crypto aren’t relatively similar everywhere, that futile game of whack-a-mole is still going to exist.

And while we may not see the U.S. take the lead during this administration, by the time we have U.S. standards fully in place, we may have new leadership in Washington. In the interim, the World Bank and IMF should do as much as they can to start producing sensible global standards (including those that can help exile state-sponsored currencies designed to evade sanctions).

Even if the value of bitcoin (or XRP or ETH or anything else) plunges, crypto will still be here. People will still search for alternatives to the status quo.

Either we can pretend it’s not real and only exacerbate all of the problems by sticking our heads in the sand or we can embrace the advancement of new ideas, platforms and technologies and bring them into the fold, rationally and thoughtfully.

Russia and Venezuela are betting we’ll pick the former. Let’s prove them wrong.

Whack-a-mole image by Shutterstock",2018-01-07 10:00:24+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/07/the-guardian-view-on-cryptocurrencies-a-greater-fools-gold,"Last month a plague of kittens brought down one of the most fashionable cryptocurrencies on the internet. This might not have been news, except that the cryptocurrency, Ethereum, bills itself as “the world computer” – a distributed program that can replace large parts of both the legitimate banking system and the legal system itself, since contracts can be written into computer code. Unless, that is, Ethereum becomes the plaything of an imaginary kitten. Like all other cryptocurrencies that have appeared in the wake of bitcoin, and like bitcoin itself, Ethereum is useless as a medium of exchange because the price fluctuates violently and unpredictably. But it turns out to be an excellent medium for the propagation of imaginary kittens and when a small Canadian company introduced a game that let players buy and breed cartoon cats, the resulting popularity brought the whole network briefly to its knees. Had Ethereum been a real currency, this would have been as if the Beanie Baby craze of the last century had crashed the world’s credit card system. But of course Ethereum is not a real currency, and neither is bitcoin; nor are Ripple, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, or any of the other thousands of cryptocurrencies that are the focus of intense speculation today.

They are the latest manifestation of the eternal dream that we could, by magic, become really rich really quickly. Why, if only you had bought bitcoin a year ago, they would now be worth 16 or 17 times as much, or, last week, only 13 times as much. What could possibly go wrong? Nonetheless the bubble must one day pop and the fool’s gold vanish, leaving only fools.

The central paradox of all these currencies is that we’re told they have eliminated the need for trust between humans and replaced it by mathematical guarantees; but all their tradeable value depends on blind faith and ignorance of computer code. Only last week a Google researcher discovered a hole in some software widely used to store bitcoins which would leak all their contents to any suitably malicious webpage that the owner visited. This had in fact been pointed out to the developers months ago, but they had not bothered to fix it. Flaws in the code of Ethereum led to the theft of $30m in the summer of 2016 and the disappearance of $170m last autumn, though all these sums are entirely notional. Even software built by gigantic, legitimate companies can turn out to have catastrophic bugs in it, as we learned last week from the publication of the Meltdown and Spectre flaws, which between them affect almost all modern computer chips.

There is even less reason to trust software developed by small teams of programmers who hope both to become insanely rich and to circumvent all efforts by governments to control them – and that is how all cryptocurrencies have been built. But there is not much use in sober realism here. So long as ordinary people can expect to make their fortunes overnight, they will step up to the gaming table and play – at least while the cryptokittens are away.",2018-01-07,,,

The South Korean government has announced that some taxes can be applied to cryptocurrencies under the current law, which will be finalized in the first half of this year. Other taxes are also being considered but some are not easily implemented under the current tax system.

Some Taxes Coming Soon

The South Korean government has been discussing ways to tax cryptocurrency transactions. “Virtual currencies are not taxable under the current Income Tax Act,” Chosun described. Previously, the regulators had not confirmed if the current legal framework allows the taxation of cryptocurrencies.

However, at a briefing on the amendment bill for the Enforcement Decree of the Revision of the Tax Code on Sunday January 7, Choi Young-rak, head of the tax department of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, was quoted by the Kyunghyang Shinmun:

There are some things that can be taxed under the current law.

Specifically, “Under current law, corporate taxation is possible,” Edaily quoted him explaining. The publication noted that the tax plan is expected to be finalized within the next six months. News1 Korea added, “The part that can be taxed by the current law will be taxed in the first half of this year.”

Specific Taxes Being Discussed

The Virtual Currency Taxation Task Force was recently created following the releases of government’s measures for crypto regulation. The group met for the first time recently with related experts and ministries including the Korean Ministry of Internal Affairs and Internal Revenue Service, according to Choi.

He was quoted by Asia Today, “There are some areas where legislation is necessary, such as capital gains tax. We need to review whether it is appropriate to impose capital gains tax and legislate.”

News1 Korea elaborated:

At present, it is concluded that the taxation of income tax, corporation tax, transfer income tax, etc. is possible in the case of virtual currency, while taxation of virtual currency is difficult in terms of value-added tax.

In addition, at a recent meeting of the National Economic Advisory Council, presided over by President Moon Jae-in, an official was quoted saying “countermeasures against the difficulty of tracking tax revenue are also necessary.” He added, “there is a need to regulate brokers who mediate virtual currency transactions such as exchanges and accumulate taxation information.”

With that trade, one bitcoin was assigned an initial value of less than a quarter of a penny.

Today, a single bitcoin could purchase 1,500 Papa John's pizzas, pay for delivery, and provide an extremely generous tip for a driver.

Over the past year, bitcoin has soared in value, withstanding heart-stopping crashes and reaching closing prices as high as $19,000 per coin. The currency's ability to climb rapidly in value has attracted not only those who use it as a form of digital payment, but also speculators who've bought in as investors with the hopes of getting rich quick. (Full disclosure: the author of this article owns .0067 of a bitcoin, and larger fractions of other cryptocurrencies not mentioned here.)

But what is bitcoin and how does it work? And what does the craze tell us about the future of finance?

The concept of cryptocurrency was first described in a 2008 white paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto's identity has never been made public, but whoever it is shuttered their online presence in December 2010, disappearing into obscurity with about a million bitcoins—an alleged stash that would now be worth more than $10 billion.

The system Nakamoto described was a way of exchanging currency without the use of a centralized bank or mint, with transactions occurring directly from person to person and protected by advanced computer encryption. Cryptocurrencies are highly secure, in part because varying degrees of anonymity are provided to users, but also because the digital network doesn't rely on a single server or institution like a bank to control or store records.

Since Nakamoto first introduced bitcoin to the world, several other forms of cryptocurrency—collectively called alt-coins—have also risen in popularity. In 2013, Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green helped develop a form of cryptocurrency called Zerocoin with a group of graduate students. Their concept has developed into a commercial currency called Zcash, which now has a $1.7 billion market cap.

""The biggest concern is that we're in the middle of this crazy bubble, and that it's all going to burst,"" Green says. ""If it does, people are going to look at the underlying technology and say, 'Wow this is a disaster, let's never talk about this again,' and I'd be really sad about that because I think this is an amazing and promising area.""

Despite the risks, bitcoin's climbing prices attract investors by the thousands to online ""wallets"" where coin purchases are made and managed. The leading platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, Coinbase, boasts more than 13 million user accounts—more than the number of brokerage accounts managed by banking giant Charles Schwab—with a reported 100,000 new users registering every day during a single week in late November.

Most of these investors buy whole or fractions of coins and use these holdings like a stock or a bond, buying low and hoping that coin values increase, later trading them for U.S. dollars. There are a growing number of retailers that accept bitcoin as a form of payment, including Microsoft, Overstock.com, Expedia, Dish Network, the global nonprofit Save the Children, Wikipedia, Tesla, the student bookstore at MIT, and the online retailer Shopify.

The trouble with using bitcoin as a currency and the risk of using it as an investment—especially during this unpredictable bull market—is the extreme fluctuations in exchange rates, and the fact that coin values are not backed by a commodity like gold, the way the U.S. dollar originally was.

""Similar to any other asset or security, bitcoin prices are driven by supply and demand,"" says Jim Liew, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School who specializes in big data machine learning and wealth management. ""If there are more buyers than sellers, the price will go up. If there are more sellers than buyers, the price will go down.""

The price of bitcoin can also be subject to manipulation, he says.

""Over the summer, two competing camps were at war over a bitcoin operational decision, and it prompted a volatile response"" he says. ""The losing camp attempted to punish bitcoin holders by abruptly selling large holdings and causing the price to fall dramatically. But the market recovered and is climbing to greater heights—for now."" ￼￼￼

As bitcoin's value and popularity soar, so too does curiosity about how the currency works.

Bitcoin transactions occur when a coin owner signs part of or all of a coin to another user—similar to endorsing a check over to another person. These transactions are publicly announced on a digital ledger called a blockchain that is passed around the Internet.

The bitcoin network doesn't have a centralized company or fleet of staff members who maintain the blockchain—that's where the bitcoin miners come in. They use highly specialized computer processors to make sure no one has spent the same bitcoin twice. These processors, called ASICs, are highly efficient at working in the encrypted network, so part of the mining process involves solving complex mathematical equations. These equations artificially slow down the mining process and help keep it competitive.

Video credit: BitcoinMining.com

Despite the efficiency of the ASICs, mining still requires a substantial amount of electricity to power the computer processors, and as the network grows, so does the energy required to maintain it. So much electricity is needed, in fact, that the bitcoin network alone reportedly uses as much electricity as 3 million American households.

Miners are reimbursed for their work—and their electricity—with bitcoins that have been freshly minted. So to speak.

Cryptocurrency is attractive as a democratic system of finance, but bitcoin has particular limitations that competing alt-coins have sought to improve. Although the bitcoin blockchain is encrypted, it's not entirely anonymous, for example. Public keys are used as digital signatures so it's possible to track transactions—and in some cases determine who is behind a payment.

Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer, aimed to address this privacy deficiency when he developed Zerocoin, which allows computers to verify transactions on the blockchain without relying on personally-identifying information.

""Back in 2013, my grad student Ian Miers and I were looking at bitcoin, trying to find ways to make it anonymous,"" he says. ""Zerocoin allows you to make transactions where nobody knows who is paying whom—even the person you pay doesn't know who you are.""

This type of enhanced, zero-knowledge blockchain system is starting to attract the institutions cryptocurrencies were originally designed to bypass: big banks.

""Banks want to redo their internal systems in a way that increases anonymity,"" Green says. ""If you're a bank, and you're doing a trade with another bank, you don't want some third or fourth or fifth bank learning about the details of that trade. But you can't do that with the [traditional] blockchain. If you want to have a blockchain where lots of banks are participating together, you need to keep your transactions secret. Zero-knowledge means I can do my transactions on the blockchain, but nobody else can see what they are, so I still get confidentiality.""

Carey Business School expert Liew says the evolving technology is also attracting businesses and credit card companies that want to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their payment options in order to draw in bitcoin users—and the collective financial value they represent.

""More traditional companies are announcing that they are accepting cryptocurrencies, so they may gain traction at some point, but it's still too early to make that call,"" he says. ""It's going to be a worthwhile currency given more time, but there will be more heart-wrenching draw-downs along the way.""

Those value draw-downs may scare away skittish investors—and may even damage the finances of less-savvy traders. But they will also likely drive innovations in the blockchain technology, like those developed by Green.

""I think we're seeing version 1.0 of what cryptocurrency can be,"" Green says. ""But years from now, nobody will care about version 1.0. They'll care about version 5.0 or 10.0. But this is going to be really important in the future.""

Adds Liew: ""This is the future of finance. Without a doubt.""",2018-01-08,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/ethereums-co-creator-predicts-a-flippening-with-bitcoin-in-2018.html,"Ethereum co-creator Steven Nerayoff says increased projects built on the cryptocurrency could trigger a ""flippening"" in 2018, in which ethereum overtakes bitcoin.

""What you're seeing with ethereum is exponential increase in the number of projects — there are billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem right now — maybe 10 times more projects this year than last year, which could easily lead to a doubling, probably a tripling in price by the end of the year,"" Nerayoff said Monday on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""

While bitcoin was designed to function as a peer to peer electronic payment system, ethereum was designed for smart contracts that execute when specific conditions are met. Nerayoff, who helped craft token sales for the ethereum project, said businesses in an increasingly wide variety of industries are starting to take note of what value Ethereum's protocol could offer them.

""You're seeing a tremendous amount of growth across a wide variety of industries. Fintech is actually the natural area, but now you're seeing it becoming increasingly more creative — you find projects in the oil and gas industry, you're finding government using it in their applications, you're seeing it in gaming, all kinds of different areas,"" Nerayoff said.

Beyond project building, Nerayoff said usage is increasing because ethereum can process transactions more quickly and cheaply than its rival.

""People are actually using it for currency, as well,"" he said. ""Lower transactional costs are increasing usage of the entire network, and that's increasing the network effects of it. There are more users, more projects being built on there and more programmers,"" he said.

Despite his confidence, Nerayoff isn't discounting bitcoin and the interest in cryptocurrency it inspired in 2017.

""The entire space is increasing. There is huge interest by the public and there are more areas in which the public can invest, even in bitcoin, so you could just see an expansion in the entire space,"" he said.

Either way, when it comes to 2018, Nerayoff thinks ethereum is going to have a good year.

The most valuable cryptocurrency's huge rise late last year, when it climbed nearly 1,400%, was dubbed a ""bubble"" by market watchers. Bitcoin's market cap is now $248.5 billion, or roughly one-third of the entire cryptocurrency world, which is valued at $721.7 billion, according to coinmarketcap.com.

Bitcoin's latest woes infected all of the biggest cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, the second-most valuable digital currency, was down more than 2%. Ripple, which had been surging, was down 27%, and Bitcoin Cash was 19% lower.

The steep drops were due to ongoing concerns about regulation and demand from Asia.

Investors should expect this wild price action to continue, given that digital currencies are still in their formative stages and are still seeking wider acceptance from markets, investors and other key players, says James Sinegal, an analyst at Morningstar.

It’s definitely a warning sign for investors.""",2018-01-08,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-its-big-in-japan,"While the Asian market accounts for a large portion of the cryptocurrency market, not all of the countries in the East have been as receptive to the burgeoning market. However, the situation is totally different in Japan thanks to a soft approach from government and much higher adoption.

Japan continues to lead the way in the East with its approach and as such, there is a higher interest from the citizens, including from the self-proclaimed ‘Miss Bitcoin.’

Miss Bitcoin

Mai Fujimoto, aka Miss Bitcoin on her social media platforms, figure-heads an attitude that seems to be crowing in the Land of the Rising Sun. She boasts how all of her disposable income is deposited straight into Bitcoin.

“I convert all my disposable income into cryptocurrency,” the 32-year-old told AFP. “I’ve been doing this for nearly a year now. I convert all my savings into cryptocurrency instead of putting them in a bank.”

Why the hype in Japan?

The attitude in places like China and even Korea is one of the people battling against the regulators. There is huge interest in these two nations from the citizens, but regulators have put their foot down.

China’s ban on ICOs, and then exchanges, set a huge precedent in terms of the hard-nosed approach to digital currencies.

Korea also recently started taking steps towards its own style of the ban on digital currencies, however, despite that, there is still massive interest.

Japan also set its own precedent in the understanding of Bitcoin as back in April it was announced that Bitcoin was accepted as legal tender, instantly showing a positive approach from the government.

Japan also benefited greatly from China’s ban as many companies and investors crossed the Sea of Japan to set up shop on the Island.

Adoption

Japan was also the pioneer in terms of Bitcoin adoption as about six months ago there was a boom in businesses trying to integrate Bitcoin payment systems. Even salaries are starting to be paid partly in Bitcoin. A well-known commentator on the crypto-business in Japan Koji Higashi said:

“The involvement of big companies, the sense of security derived from government approval and media exposure really brought in a whole new group of people to the market.”

A good alternative

Bitcoin also comes at a great time for the investment-savvy Japanese as ultra-low interest rates from the deflation-battling central bank that has left investors scratching their heads for places to find returns on their cash.

However, some are suggesting that it is more hype and mania than savvy investing.

He said: “They’re going to slowly mete it out over the next several years, this has alleviated some of the concern.

“That being said, purist denaturalised coin people don’t necessarily like what Ripple has done. “I happen to like that they have several banks using it, and they have a company that is out there trying to make the value of the currency go high.” Ripple also does not hold the level of anonymity that bitcoin does, which makes the currency more favourable to banks. Banks are taking notice of Ripple, with over 100 banks around the world using the blockchain, according to the company’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse.",2018-01-08 14:34:00+00:00,https://mashable.com/2018/01/08/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-governments/,"Russia is working on a government-run cryptocurrency. And they're not alone.

Governments around the world — including the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Venezuela, Estonia, Sweden, and Uruguay — are either actively working on some form of digital currency or exploring the topic.

But don't expect a bunch of bitcoin clones. Governments have very different priorities, and decentralization — a main feature of most cryptocurrenices including bitcoin — doesn't tend to be one of them. In fact, government digital currencies could herald a new era of centralization, posing serious questions about privacy and the viability of true cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

There's important differences between true cryptocurrencies and what are generally called ""centralized digital currencies"" (CDCs). One of the main qualities — if not the central feature — of cryptocurrencies is that they're decentralized. This means no single person, government, company, or group can control them. CDCs, on the other hand, are on the opposite end of the spectrum. They are as centralized as can be.

That centralization could provide governments with some world-changing capabilities — some good, some rather scary. There's the upside of giving people a secure and cheap way to buy thing. There's also serious privacy concerns, especially when talking about authoritarian countries.

Russia has, in particular, floated some interesting ideas around why it would want to introduce some form of government-led cryptocurrency. Details are scant, and it's not clear if the ""cryptoruble"" would be a true cryptocurrency using decentralized ledger technology or if it could be mined. What is clear, however, is that Russia is interested in some sort of digital currency to get around international sanctions and possibly even allow the government to tax its sizable black markets.

""There have been two reactions from central governments. One is to try to figure out how to regulate the darn things, and the other is, do we figure out how to make our own?"" said Paul Triolo, head of geotechnology at the Eurasia Group. ""2017 was sort of a watershed year in that 2017 saw the regulatory response globally really pick up.""

Why now?

The technology behind digital cash isn't new in concept of execution. Long before Venmo had become a verb, companies were working toward entirely digital transactions.

Adoption wasn't terribly quick or widespread. Nor were the systems that emerged to service digital transactions terribly efficient or cheap. Governments and banks weren't in any hurry to adopt this tech since nobody else was either.

Then bitcoin happened. The explosion of BTC and other cryptocurrencies have forced governments to take a look at just what these technologies mean for the future of commerce, finance, and centralized authority over the creation and movement of money.

Jacob Eliosoff, founder of cryptocurrency investment fund Calibrated Markets, said governments are now seeing the benefits of this technology but are also going to need time to understand it.

""In principle there could be various benefits: the simple efficiency of instant global electronic transactions, preventing counterfeiting, better record-keeping and monitoring of transactions, no printing press, etc,"" Eliosoff wrote in an email. ""But also right now some governments, like some companies, are probably just dazzled by the hype and making stuff up so as not to get left behind.""

There's also some larger conceptual issues at play here. Bitcoin has proven that it's possible to create money outside of government-based financial systems. Ole Bjerg, an associate professor in at Copenhagen Business School, said this is forcing governments and central banks to ask tough questions about their role in the economies of the future.

""What bitcoin has done is it's sort of made a lot of people aware that you can actually create money in new ways,"" Bjerg said.

By many definitions, digital currencies backed, issued, and tracked by a government or central bank would not be a cryptocurrency.

""To many of us Bitcoiners, the essence of 'crypto' is decentralization: a currency that no person or institution owns or controls, so no one can take it from you or prevent you from sending it, or print it at will,"" Eliosoff wrote. ""Countries like Denmark have been moving towards cashless societies since before Bitcoin existed, but of course those are still centrally managed currencies. You don't have to be against fiat per se (I'm not) to see it as fundamentally different from cryptocurrencies.""

To some, the question of what is and isn't a cryptocurrency is besides the point. The mechanism is just a detail.

""The main point is you can have digital money which is a liability with a central bank rather than a private bank. Whether you do that with a blockchain or you do it with a database doesn't make much of a difference,"" Bjerg said.

Why should I care?

There's a very simple reason a government digital currency could be good for you.

It'll save you money.

Andrew Levin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College, said digital currencies could cut out middlemen and banks, meaning fewer people taking a cut out of transactions.

""One important reason for trying to move ahead with a central bank digital currency is to create a payment system that is essentially free for consumers and businesses,"" Levin said.

If you have a debit card, there's a good chance it says some combination of MasterCard, Visa, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, or any variety of other companies. They're not providing that service out of the goodness of their hearts. They make money when you use that card.

Under the new system, you'd pay with money directly held by the government (or really a country's central bank) through what some call a ""Centralized Digital Currency,"" or CDC.

With a CDC, you'd have a card but it wouldn't say any of those companies. It would say probably say ""U.S. Federal Reserve"" — the U.S. central bank. It wouldn't take any cut, and the U.S. government is much less likely than a bank to go under and take your cash with it.

A CDC, then, is the functional equivalent to using cash, with one big caveat that we'll get to shortly.

Even the economists are getting excited

There's a good reason that economists have been getting excited about CDCs.

Governments control the economy through central banks. In the U.S., that's the Federal Reserve a.k.a the Fed. The Fed controls the economy through a relatively arcane system in which it tweaks interest rates to control the money supply. It’s a multi-step process that attempts to influence spending and saving behavior by consumers and businesses. But since financial resources are held by private institutions, the ultimate effects of the Fed’s decisions are filtered through these other organizations.

The major upside of a CDC is that central banks would be able to directly change the interest rates on the currency, meaning it’s incentives for saving and spending would pack a much bigger punch. And not just that, it could easily turn the interest rate negative — something central banks can't really do now — when it really needed to stimulate growth.

After the financial crisis and the ensuing global economic slowdown, these measures did not prove terribly effective at stimulating growth. Central banks did what they could, lowering interest rates about as much as they could in order to try to goose their economies.

Giving central banks the ability to aggressively push the economy through control of a digital currency would make a major difference in peoples' lives, Levin said.

""This has been a very long slow painful recovery that's been very painful for lots of normal households. Normal American families have really suffered for the last ten years and part of the reason for that is that the Federal Reserve was constrained,"" he said.

Imagine that the financial crisis was just a speed bump instead of a giant crater that the U.S. (and really the world) is just barely climbing out of. That's the kind of promise that some economists think CDCs could deliver on.

OK, so what are the downsides?

There's two main drawbacks here.

The first is that the promise of decentralization isn't just negated by a central digital currency; a CDC is even more centralized than the existing system. For people who believe that decentralization is a good thing that will free people from dependence on governments and big companies,

The other main drawback is privacy. Cash is anonymous, giving people a certain amount of freedom to spend money without having to worry about explaining their actions.

A CDC would conceivably remove any and all privacy from your spending (at least as far as hiding it from the government).

""This sounds glib, but many of us would argue that untraceable transactions are actually an important civil liberty which cryptocurrency enables, but digital fiat impairs,"" Eliosoff wrote.

Russia's nefarious goals for its cryptocurrencies point to how governments around the world could start embracing digital currencies for their own ends both good and bad. Meanwhile, countries like Russia and China — two of the countries most aggressively pursuing their own digital currencies — are the ones cracking down hardest on bitcoin and other distributed currencies.

Cache money

In the near future, not much will change. Governments don't tend to move quickly. There will be any number of tests to see how this could work, as some countries have done with ideas like a minimum basic income.

They could, however, be forced to adapt if cryptocurrencies begin to offer a real, viable alternative to the existing financial system. There's plenty of blockchain enthusiasts who believe that's just a matter of time, though it could be a while.",2018-01-08,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/new-insane-etf-proposal-for-bitcoin-generates-worry-on-wall-street.html,"Caution tape hangs near the steps of Federal Hall across from the New York Stock Exchange in New York.

""That would be insane for them to actually approve this. Then they're putting a rubber stamp on it as an asset, and I don't think governments want to go there yet,"" said Michael Cohn, chief investment strategist at Atlantis Asset Management. ""It just seems as though it's not something I'd want to put my clients into in any way, shape or form. You can only be embarrassed.""

But the effort by Direxion to bring them into the shadowy world of digital currency is raising some concern on Wall Street. The firm filed its application with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Jan. 4, starting a process that those familiar with it say could take six to nine months.

Such so-called leveraged funds, which use derivatives to achieve their investment goals, have been on the market for years. With $34.7 billion in assets, the funds make up a small but growing part of the $3.5 trillion ETF industry, according to ETF.com.

A regulatory application from Direxion Asset Management seeks approval for five new funds — one that seeks straight-up correlation with the cryptocurrency, but four others designed to amplify price movements either up or down.

The latest efforts to expand the way investors can buy bitcoins venture into the often misunderstood and potentially dangerous area of leveraged ETFs.

While it's far too early to tell what kind of chance Direxion has for gaining approval, it's important to understand what the proposed funds are and what they are not.

Their names are Direxion Daily Bitcoin Bear 1X Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.25X Bull Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 1.5 Bull Shares, Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bull Shares and Direxion Daily Bitcoin 2X Bear Shares. Direxion did not respond to a request for comment.

If approved, the latter four shares would use leverage to replicate the daily price movements of bitcoin by 1.25, 1.5 and two times respectively. The bear fund would effectively ""short"" bitcoin, or capitalize on declines in price.

However, the funds wouldn't be tied to the price of bitcoin per se but rather the futures price traded on the Cboe and CME. As such, the Direxion application points out that the funds ""should not be expected to track the performance of the target benchmark for any period longer than one business day.""

""There are a lot of conflicting attitudes about this thing. I don't think the SEC can wrap their arms around this,"" Cohn said. ""It's not an asset class, it's not a currency. It's going to be evolved into a technology. As to whether that technology is viable, that remains to be seen.""

Indeed, Merrill Lynch recently raised eyebrows when it slapped a ban on bitcoin trading, while other Wall Street principals such as J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink have decried it as well.

""Can you imagine what a 2X bitcoin put or call is going to do? It's going to be amazing volatility,"" said Nick Colas, a bitcoin watcher and co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""It's eye-watering.""

Colas said he sees the attempts at leveraging bitcoin as part of traders' quest for volatility, which has been noticeably missing from most of the market but is pretty much a daily fact of life for cryptocurrencies.

""This is the analog of the search for volatility,"" he said. ""Obviously, bitcoin does have a lot of volatility on its own. This is an attempt to create a product that has some volatility that leverages that.""

However, the Direxion efforts could represent just another step in the maturation process for cryptocurrencies, whose popularity has exploded over the past year. The top five offerings alone — bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and cardano — have a combined market cap of over half a trillion dollars, according to CoinMarketCap. Some 40 cryptos are worth more than $1 billion each.

Watchers of the growing space figured it was only a matter of time before bitcoin ETF applications accelerated after the CME and Cboe greenlighted futures trading.

""We're seeing different measures and steps and approaches to attempt to further legitimize digital currency. This is part of the reason why I say digital currency is here to stay,"" said Sheila Warren, the World Economic Forum's head of blockchain, which is the technology that powers cryptocurrencies.

""Institutional investors and others are going to respond to [the Direxion funds]. That's what's intended,"" she added. ""Is that a good thing or a bad thing? That's a matter of opinion.""

Warren said the SEC should apply consumer protection principles when evaluating applications from Direxion and others. The commission thus far has taken a fairly dim view of bitcoin-related ETFs, but that was before futures trading began.

With price discovery more attainable, that could push the SEC to take another look. The commission does not comment on ongoing applications.

""There's going to be a lot of ETFs getting approved this year,"" said David Drake, founder and chairman of LDJ Capital. ""I don't think it's going to be oversaturated. The market can handle quite a few of them.""

Drake said he expects the SEC to be ""very careful"" when reviewing the Direxion application as well as what he expects to be a fairly large flow of other applicants this year.",2018-01-08,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42582343,"""With the right support for innovation, and collaboration Africa could once again leapfrog over the digital divide and become a market leader just like it did in the move from landline communications infrastructure to the mobile phone ecosystem.""",

He made his comments in an exclusive interview with Fox Business at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco.

In September 2017 at a banking conference, Dimon called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" and said that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded Bitcoin on the company’s accounts, in part for being “stupid”.

He also told Fox Business today that he “regrets” making the September comments, but is “not interested that much in the subject at all.”

However, despite his lack of interest, Dimon made an ambiguous statement about the government’s relationship to Bitcoin, telling Fox Business:

“The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people.”

Though it is unclear exactly what Dimon intended to say with these words, in the context of his earlier comments on the subject from 2015, he may have meant that cryptocurrency would eventually become fully government-controlled.

In 2015, responding to a question about the potential for a decentralized “shadow economy” of cryptocurrencies, Dimon stated more clearly:

“It’s just not gonna happen, you’re wasting your time. This is my personal opinion. There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There’s no government that’s gonna put up with it for long.”

During the Jan. 9 interview with Fox, Dimon asserted, as he did in 2015, that the viable digital currencies will be those that are government-backed, or fiat, such as a digital yen or dollar:

“You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO's you have to look at individually.”

Dimon seemed optimistic about Blockchain technology, noting:

“The blockchain is real.”

In 2017, multiple governments around the world announced that they were considering implementing a national digital currency. Others, such as Venezuela, have already done so.

An earlier version of this article implied that Dimon's 2015 statements were in fact made Jan. 9, 2018. The text has been edited to clarify timing.

""I don't see bitcoin as a credible competitor to the dollar in the United States of America, and the reason is the barrier of entry to you creating your own coin and me creating my own virtual currency ... is zero,"" Kashkari said. He noted that digital currencies can pose threats to one another, though, and that there's a ""long way of going before we know how this shakes out.""

But after a successful rebrand to focus on blockchain initiatives in addition to cold beverages, Long Blockchain is back in the safe zone. Shares rallied, allowing LBCC to achieve Nasdaq's ultimatum to avoid delisting: market value had to rise above $35 million for 10 straight days. After a nearly 20% rally Tuesday following news LBCC has purchased crypto mining operations, the company's market cap stands at about $56 million.

Harvard Profs: Bitcoin Bound to Drop

According to a report in Harvard University's Crimson newspaper, a group of Harvard economics professors asserted that the current valuation of bitcoin is ""unsustainable and will drop, thanks in part to government regulation."" From Harvard professor and crypto expert Ken Rogoff: ""near-anonymity"" allows for bitcoin's high valuation, but governments will soon want to unmask bitcoin users in the future.

More of What's Trending on TheStreet:",2018-01-09 22:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/kodak-launching-cryptocurrency-photographers,"U.S. technology firm Kodak has announced that it will launch its own cryptocurrency, with plans to host an initial coin offering (ICO) at the end of January.

In an official announcement, Kodak said the cryptocurrency would underpin “an encrypted, digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers.” Kodak is working with a company called WENN Digital on the initiative.

The idea is that photographers could use Kodak’s forthcoming blockchain to register works, with “KODAKCoin” functioning as a medium of exchange on the platform. Users can receive payment in the cryptocurrency as well as pay for rights, according to the company.

The unveiling marks the first time Kodak has revealed its interest in the technology. The company is perhaps best known for its photography-related products, though a bankruptcy and subsequent recovery in 2013 led the firm to focus more actively on printing and digital film.

Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said in a statement:

“For many in the tech industry, ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem. Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.”

It’s not clear at this time how much Kodak intends to seek through the ICO, but the company said that the token sale – set for Jan. 31 – will be open to accredited investors from countries including the U.S. and Canada.

“This initial Coin Offering is issued under SEC guidelines as a security token under Regulation 506 (c) as an exempt offering,” Kodak said.

Market data suggests that, at the very least, Kodak is enjoying a bit of an investor windfall as a result of its announcement. As of press time, shares for Kodak are up roughly 37 percent for the day, having risen from an opening of $3.10 to as high as $5.50 before settling down around $4.30, according to Google data.

Investors have generally reacted to these announcements by sending the stocks soaring. However, Kodak framed the move as being about more than profiting off a buzzword.

""For many in the tech industry, 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' are hot buzzwords,"" Jeff Clarke, Kodak's CEO, said in a statement. ""But for photographers who've long struggled to assert control over their work and how it's used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem.""

Kodak says it will use the blockchain, essentially a digital ledger, for a new platform called KODAKOne to help photographers manage image rights. KODAKCoin will be used for transactions when photographers license their work.

The Kodak news was quickly met with sarcasm on social media. As one reporter joked on Twitter (TWTR), it may only be a matter of time before we see the launch of ""PolaroidCOIN"" and ""SearsCOIN.""

This would imply the opportunity for invested funds to double in value about once every decade.

However, cryptocurrency investors have laughed their way to the bank over the past year, with virtual currency valuations going through the roof. When 2017 began, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies combined was just $17.7 billion. By Jan. 4, 2018 (369 days later), the combined market cap of all 1,384 investable cryptocurrencies had soared to $774 billion. That's an increase in value of close to 4,300%, and it's a return the broad-based stock indexes would take decades to deliver.

Objects in the rearview mirror are getting closer

Bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, and the digital coin accepted by more merchants than any other virtual currency, is often credited with being the impetus for this rally. After all, bitcoin was the first to bring blockchain technology -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that underlies cryptocurrencies -- into the mainstream, and was the first actively traded digital currency on decentralized exchanges.

But, truth be told, the rally in recent months has been about far more than just bitcoin. In fact, bitcoin's dominance in relation to the aggregate cryptocurrency market cap is about as low as it's ever been at 34%, suggesting that the valuations of other virtual coins are growing at a much quicker pace than bitcoin's. In fact, the aggregate value of all cryptocurrencies, excluding bitcoin, has jumped from $2.24 billion on Dec. 31, 2016 to $522 billion as of Jan. 4, 2018, according to CoinMarketCap.com. That's a better than 23,200% increase in just over a year's time.

The search for the next bitcoin has investors and speculators pushing a number of digital currencies higher. However, only four, in my opinion, currently have the ""tools"" needed to surpass bitcoin's market cap in the intermediate term.

The two likeliest candidates to surpass bitcoin

Two of the likeliest cryptocurrencies to surpass bitcoin's market cap are Ethereum and/or Ripple, which just so happen to be third and second, respectively, in cryptocurrency market cap at the moment.

Ethereum

What makes Ethereum so special is its blockchain, and the number of organizations currently testing out that blockchain technology in some capacity. Ethereum's digital ledger incorporates protocols known as ""smart contracts,"" which help to verify, facilitate, or enforce the negotiation of a contract. Smart contracts are particularly attractive from an efficacy and legal standpoint for businesses, which is why the Ethereum Foundation has had little issue finding takers to test out its technology. Ethereum's blockchain also moves beyond bitcoin's currency-only applications, which is why so many different industries are interested in what Ethereum has to offer.

In February, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance was formed, and by Oct. 18, 2017, exactly 200 organizations from a variety of industries were testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain in small-scale and pilot projects. This includes a number of brand-name companies, as well as governments. If we begin to see wider acceptance of the Ethereum blockchain in real-world applications (i.e., beyond pilot projects), there's a real chance it could surpass bitcoin's market cap.

Ripple

Ripple might even be a bigger threat to bitcoin, with the second-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin needing only to double once more in order to surpass it.

Like Ethereum, all eyes are on Ripple's blockchain technology, which is being specifically targeted at big banks and financial institutions. Ripple's exceptionally low transactions fees and quick settlement times are designed to be a major upgrade over the long-winded verification process payments go through with the traditional banking system.

Though Ripple announced in June 2016 that seven large banks would be testing out its blockchain technology in a limited capacity, it really gained notoriety in November 2017 when American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Banco Santander (NYSE:SAN) announced their intention to use Ripple's blockchain in a real-world test. The partnership will allow U.S.-based American Express users who send non-card payments to U.K. Santander accounts to have those payments processed through Ripple's blockchain. It's believed that these transactions will settle instantly, which is far quicker than what happens with current cross-border transactions, where the verification process can take days.

Ripple has also benefited from rumors surrounding its presumably inevitable listing on Coinbase, the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchange. Assuming it does get listed soon and manages to snag new banking partners, it could give bitcoin a real run for its money.

Two dark-horse candidates that could really surprise and surpass bitcoin

There are also two dark-horse candidates that could do exactly what Ripple has done and emerge from the shadows to make a run at bitcoin.

Stellar

As with Ripple and Ethereum, Stellar's blockchain technology is the star. Stellar's blockchain offers quick processing times on its network of between two and five seconds for most transactions, which again would be a major improvement over the extended verification times often seen in cross-border payments.

Stellar's blockchain also incorporates its own version of smart contracts. Again, Stellar is making it clear that its blockchain is designed for enterprise customers and targeted at cross-border scalable applications.

But unlike Ripple and its laser focus on big banks, Stellar is approaching its search for scalability by seeking out multinational businesses. In October, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and KlickEx partnered with Stellar to facilitate cheaper and quicker cross-border transactions in the South Pacific region. This partnership involves a dozen international banks, representing multiple different currencies, developing and deploying Stellar's blockchain. The idea here being that IBM, which generates tens of billions of dollars each year outside the U.S., can receive payments from customers and have those payment process almost instantly, instead of waiting days for them to settle.

Assuming this project proves fruitful for IBM, ""Big Blue"" could choose to expand its application to other parts of the world. This is Stellar's chance to shine, and if it does, it may have a shot at garnering new partnerships and toppling bitcoin in the process.

Monero

Though it's the smallest of the four at the moment, with a market cap that's almost $250 billion behind that of bitcoin, Monero has the potential to really turn heads and supplant bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency.

Why Monero, you ask? Look no further than the tremendous surge in interest for privacy coins of late. A privacy coin is nothing more than a virtual currency that's placed an increased emphasis on the privacy and anonymity of the sender and receivers of virtual funds.

Many cryptocurrency users falsely believe that because their logged data is stored in an encrypted fashion on a digital ledger that it can't be traced back to them -- but this just isn't true. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service recently won a legal battle against Coinbase that required the cryptocurrency exchange to turn over information on 14,355 users who'd exchanged more than $20,000 worth of bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. Though the IRS's legal win was for the purpose of catching capital-gain tax evaders, the broader theme here is that blockchain transactions often aren't as anonymous as you'd think.

Monero employs an open-sourced protocol known as CryptoNote that uses ring signatures to obscure the sender of a payment. Ring signatures are akin to having multiple signers on a joint bank account, but without knowing who the official signer is. Each transaction on Monero's blockchain generates a one-time spend key known as a stealth address that allows only the recipient to detect and spend those funds.

If privacy coins remain popular among cryptocurrency investors, and Monero lands a major partner, it could come out of nowhere to leapfrog bitcoin.",2018-01-09,https://www.coindesk.com/report-south-korea-eyes-joint-crypto-regulations-with-china-japan,"Finance regulators in South Korea are reportedly looking to cooperate with authorities in China and Japan on new rules for cryptocurrency trading.

A Jan. 8 report by Yonhap News states that representatives from the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC), as well as those from the relevant agencies in Japan and China, met last month to discuss the oversight of cryptocurrency investment.

FSC chairman Choi Jong-ku, according to the source, told reporters that the countries plan to cooperate in their efforts to curb speculative investing. Jong-ku reportedly called investing in cryptocurrencies “irrational,” going on to say:

“[A] fever of speculative investment in cryptocurrencies is ongoing … however, cryptocurrencies are unable to play a role as a means of payment.”

The report follows a statement by the country’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and Financial Intelligence Unit, which outlined how the two bodies have begun inspecting six banks to ensure they are in compliance with newly-implemented anti-money laundering regulations.

The banks in question have ties to the country’s bitcoin exchange ecosystem, which in recent months has seen elevated trading volumes and prices trading at high premiums compared to other marketplaces around the world. South Korean officials have expressed concern about price speculation around cryptocurrencies in the past.

And in what is perhaps a sign of the speculative boom taking place in the country, data site CoinMarketCap excluded three Korean exchanges earlier this week due to the price differences.

There’s been a lot of talk lately about market capitalization and circulating supply. As sub-$1 altcoins have shot up in price, some new investors have been making noises about their anointed coin being worth more than bitcoin one day. What these new entrants fail to take into account is digital scarcity: the notion that assets which are plentiful are cheaper than those with a limited supply for good reason. Bitcoin Price Equivalence is a new website that seeks to set that right.

Cheap But at What Price?

The rise of crypto’s “penny stocks” has brought with it fevered debate about how much these digital assets are worth. A widely circulated tweet last week “Removing Unit Bias,” asked, “If everything had the same supply cap as Bitcoin, would you still buy it?” and displayed popular cryptocurrencies’ current value if there were just 21 million of each in existence. Bitcoin columnist Eric Wall followed this up in his weekly trading feature, writing:

Of course, the unit price of a coin is a totally senseless basis for making investment choices on. Any cryptocurrency–even Bitcoin–could have been a sub-cent item, if Satoshi chose the final cap to be 21 quadrillion instead of 21 million.

To help calculate the true value of cryptocurrencies, whose circulating supply can differ wildly, a new website has been created. Bitcoin Price Equivalence “normalises price by removing unit bias, coins that look “cheap” are probably not as cheap as you think”.

Leveling the Playing Field

If ripple and stellar had the same supply as bitcoin, for example, one XRP would cost around $15,000 and one XLM would be worth $4,000. The two coins currently trade for around $2.50 and $0.66 respectively. The question buyers should be asking themselves when eyeing a “cheap” cryptocurrency is “Would I be willing to pay this if it were priced using the BPE?” Plenty of buyers are willing to pay a few dollars for a ripple, but no one in their right mind would consider shelling out $15,000 for one. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no shortage of takers at that price.

Dentacoin is a token for the dental industry which has been raising eyebrows since soaring to a $1.8 billion market cap. The BPE of the coin, of which there are eight trillion, works out at $633. Should the coin ever reach its BPE valuation, dental patients will be paying for a check-up using fractions of a DCN.

The Bitcoin Price Equivalence is useful not only in showing coins that are blatantly overvalued, but also in showing ones that still have room to grow. Ethereum, for example, has a BPE of $6,700. The network has its share of problems to address, including scaling and over-centralization, but at least ethereum is being used. A $6,700 ethereum in the future sounds less far-fetched than a $15k ripple, $633 dentacoin or $600 kin.

Do you think the Bitcoin Price Equivalence is a useful way of valuing cryptocurrencies? Let us know in the comments section below.

The clampdown in South Korea, a crucial source of global demand for cryptocurrency, came as policymakers around the world struggled to regulate an asset whose value has skyrocketed over the last year.

Justice minister Park Sang-ki said the government was preparing a bill to ban trading of the virtual currency on domestic exchanges.

“There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,” Park told a news conference, according to the ministry’s press office.

After the market’s sharp reaction to the announcement, the nation’s Presidential office hours later said a ban on the country’s virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalised while it was one of the measures being considered.

A press official at the justice ministry said the proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading was announced after “enough discussion” with other government agencies, including the nation’s finance ministry and financial regulators.

Once a bill is drafted, legislation for an outright ban of virtual coin trading will require a majority vote of the total 297 members of the National Assembly, a process that could take months or even years.

The government’s tough stance triggered a selloff of the cryptocurrency on both local and offshore exchanges.

The local price of bitcoin plunged as much as 21 percent in midday trade to 18.3 million won ($17,064.53) after the minister’s comments. It still trades at around a 30 percent premium compared to other countries.

Bitcoin BTC=BTSP was down more than 10 percent on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp at $13,199, after earlier dropping as low as $13,120, its weakest since Jan. 2.

South Korea's cryptocurrency-related shares were also hammered. Vidente 121800.KQ and Omnitel 057680.KQ, which are stakeholders of Bithumb, skidded by the daily trading limit of 30 percent each.

Once enforced, South Korea’s ban “will make trading difficult here, but not impossible,” said Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at EST Security.

“Keen traders, especially hackers, will find it tough to cash out their gains from virtual coin investments in Korea but they can go overseas, for example Japan,” Mun said.

Park Nok-sun, a cryptocurrency analyst at NH Investment & Securities, said the herd behavior in South Korea’s virtual coin market has raised concerns.

Indeed, bitcoin's BTC=BTSP 1,500 percent surge last year has stoked huge demand for cryptocurency in South Korea, drawing college students to housewives and sparking worries of a gambling addiction.

“Some officials are pushing for stronger and stronger regulations because they only see more (investors) jumping in, not out,” Park said.

By Thursday afternoon, the Justice Ministry’s announcement had prompted more than 55,000 South Koreans to join a petition asking the presidential Blue House to halt the crackdown on the virtual currency, making the Blue House website intermittently unavailable due to heavy traffic, the website showed.

REGULATORY CONUNDRUM

There are more than a dozen cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, according to Korea Blockchain Industry Association.

The proliferation of the virtual currency and the accompanying trading frenzy have raised eyebrows among regulators globally, though many central banks have refrained from supervising cryptocurrencies themselves.

The news of South Korea’s proposed ban came as authorities tightened their grip on some cryptocurrency exchanges.

The nation’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinone and Bithumb were raided by police and tax agencies this week for alleged tax evasion. The raids follow moves by the finance ministry to identify ways to tax the market that has become as big as the nation’s small-cap Kosdaq index in terms of daily trading volume.

Some investors appeared to have taken preemptive action.

“I have already cashed most of mine (virtual coins) as I was aware that something was coming up in a couple of days,” said Eoh Kyung-hoon, a 23-year old investor.

Bitcoin sank on Monday after website CoinMarketCap removed prices from South Korean exchanges, because coins were trading at a premium of about 30 percent in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. That created confusion and triggered a broad selloff among investors.

An official at Coinone told Reuters that a few officials from the National Tax Service raided the company’s office this week. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Coinone was cooperating with the investigation.

Bithumb, the second largest virtual currency operator in South Korea, was also raided by the tax authorities on Wednesday.

“We were asked by the tax officials to disclose paperwork,” an official at Bithumb said, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.

The nation’s tax office and police declined to confirm whether they raided the local exchanges.

South Korean financial authorities had previously said they are inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions, amid concerns the increasing use of such assets could lead to a surge in crime.

Reuters reported tonight that Bithumb and Coinone were raided by police and tax office officials on Wednesday and Thursday. Citing employees of the two exchanges, which are among the largest in South Korea, the news service said officials visited their offices amid an investigation into alleged tax evasion.

“Local police also have been investigating our company since last year, they think what we do is gambling,” a Coinone employee told Reuters. The employee said that the exchange was cooperating with the investigation.

In an email to CoinDesk, a representative of Bithumb confirmed that they had met with Korean tax authorities.

“It is true that the National Tax Service visited Bithumb. However, we weren’t raided by the police,” the rep said.

Separately, South Korean news service SBS has reported that the South Korean Justice Department is planning legislation that would pave the way for exchanges in the country to be shut down entirely.

“The Ministry of Justice will set up its own bill, which sees the virtual money brokerage itself as illegal and completely closes the exchange, and plans to start full-fledged ministry discussions this week,” the service reported, according to a translation.

According to a subsequent report from Reuters, the Justice Ministry said that a bill was forthcoming.

“There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,” Park Sang-ki was quoted as saying.

The news represents a significant expansion in the growing scrutiny applied to the crypto-exchange space by South Korean regulators. Earlier this week, the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit and the Financial Supervisory Service announced that they were inspecting six unnamed banks for compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations.

The government had already declared in December that it would move to apply more scrutiny amid growing trade volume at the exchanges, including moves to curb anonymous trading.

Exchanges in South Korea have consistently seen prices well above those seen on other marketplaces. Indeed, it’s a circumstance that earlier this week led to a controversial change by one popular data service to begin excluding some of the country’s exchanges from its cryptocurrency price averages.

Bitcoin prices fell last month after South Korean authorities announced steps to regulate cryptoassets. This week, authorities raided some of South Korea’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Coinone and Bithumb, two large exchanges for virtual currencies like bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, were raided by police and tax authorities, according to Reuters. An official at Coinone said that National Tax Service investigators had paid a sudden visit, while an employee at Bithumb said the company was asked to disclose paperwork. The Coinone official added that the exchange has been under scrutiny since last year by local police who “think what we do is gambling.”

Virtual-currency exchanges have sprung up rapidly in the past year or so in South Korea, with everyone from college students to grandparents trying to cash in on the craze (paywall). Recently the nation accounted for some 20% of global bitcoin transactions.

In Seoul last August Bithumb launched a walk-in customer service center, and the following month Coinone opened a store front in the financial district complete with a help desk and virtual-currency ATMs.

The South Korean government announced last month it would crack down on potential money-laundering using virtual currencies, and ban anonymous accounts with cryptocurrency exchanges. Earlier this week, South Korean authorities said they were also inspecting six local banks that provide virtual-currency accounts to institutions, checking whether they were requiring real names for accounts and following rules against money laundering.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Wednesday the recent craze over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well. ""In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,"" the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said. ""When it happens or how or anything else, I don't know,"" he added in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" from Omaha, Nebraska. ""If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it but I would never short a dime's worth.""

Also on the show, Buffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, also blasted frothiness in bitcoin — and in venture capital funding. Earlier Wednesday, the Omaha-based conglomerate announced the appointment of two new vice chairs. Gregory Abel, 55, will be vice chair of non-insurance businesses. Ajit Jain, 66, will be vice chair of insurance operations. Buffett said he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures. ""We don't own any, we're not short any, we'll never have a position in them,"" he said.

An upcoming conference dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology has stopped accepting ticket payments in bitcoin, suggesting that the method was slow, costly and labor-intensive.

The North American Bitcoin Conference, held in Miami next week, said on its website that network congestion and manual processing influenced the decision to stop accepting payments in cryptocurrencies.

Last minute tickets were selling for $1,000.

""We have, and always will, accept cryptocurrencies for our conferences, up to fourteen days before the event,"" the organizers wrote. ""However, due to the manual inputting of data in our ticketing platforms when paid in cryptocurrencies, we decided to shut down bitcoin payments for last minute sales due to print deadlines.""

CNBC has reached out to the organizers for further comment.

The conference organizer, Moe Levin, earlier told Bitcoin.com that his company was working to get bitcoin cash or other digital assets with cheaper fees integrated into the ticketing system. He told the news site: ""We wish this was easier, but no ticketing options exist which can handle large volumes of ticket sales, and transaction fees on the Bitcoin blockchain exceed $30 at certain times of the day.""

Relatively slow transaction times and high processing fees for bitcoin payments have led to many merchants rethinking their decisions to accept cryptocurrencies. For example, tech giant Microsoft temporarily stopped taking bitcoin as a payment option at its store, before resuming such transactions. Last month, gaming platform Steam also stopped accepting payments in bitcoin, citing ""high fees"" and ""volatility.""

According to industry site BitInfoCharts, in the last three months, the average bitcoin transaction fee was as high as $55. On Jan. 9, data showed the fee was about $31.

Bitcoin's relatively high transaction fees are, however, profitable for so-called bitcoin ""miners,"" who work out complex cryptographic puzzles to add transactions to the blockchain — a decentralized record of all bitcoin transactions. In return, they are rewarded bitcoin.

Meanwhile, data from Blockchain.info showed that, at the time of publishing, it takes an average of 51 minutes to confirm a bitcoin transaction. Over a 30-day period, that average time was as high as 3,564 minutes (more than 59 hours) on Jan. 1.

What is Ethereum? How is it different from Bitcoin? How do you get Ethers? What does the future look like for Ethereum? In this tutorial, Jakob Mayer will answer all these questions and more.

What is Blockchain and why is it important to understand what Ethereum is?

To understand what Ethereum is and why it is needed, it is important to first define the term ‘Blockchain’. To best understand what Blockchain is, the easiest way is to visualize an Excel spreadsheet with the same information on it stored on thousands of computers. Whenever someone changes this spreadsheet, every user has the ability to see this change immediately.

The Blockchain database is not just stored on one computer or server, but on thousands of devices. This makes all existing data publicly accessible and easily verifiable. Also, hackers cannot attack a single database due to it being stored on thousands of computers. In short, Blockchain is a decentralized database that is transparent to anyone and less vulnerable to hacker attacks because the database is stored on thousands of computers.

What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open source software platform based on blockchain technology, enabling software developers to create decentralized applications.

What is the difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin?

Ethereum and Bitcoin are both Blockchain-based technologies. The biggest difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin lies primarily in the use of their technologies. Bitcoin only offers a Blockchain-based application. This is namely the ability to send and receive from a digital currency, that being Bitcoin. The Ethereum Blockchain on the other hand, not only provides the ability to receive and send payments but also allows all decentralized applications to be handled through the Ethereum Blockchain network.

Also, the Ethereum network has a digital currency called Ether. This can be mined by miners, similar to Bitcoins, and serves Ethereum developers to make payments for services and payments to use the Ethereum network. Another advantage of the Ethereum Blockchain over the Bitcoin Blockchain is the so-called Smart Contracts.

A Smart Contract is a computer code that allows an operation to be performed when a previously determined condition occurs. For Bitcoins, these Smart Contracts are limited to sending and receiving payments. The Ethereum Network, on the other hand, allows developers to develop a Smart Contract for a variety of operations. For example, a Smart Contract could be used to fulfill a service.

One problem with Blockchain technologies is known as ‘forks’. These are changes in the Blockchain code. These need to be done in part to counter network congestion or make operations more efficient. Such forks must be agreed within the community and carried out at the same time, otherwise individual applications will no longer work without corresponding updates. Such forks have been necessary for Bitcoin but also for the Ethereum network on several occasions.

How do you get Ethers?

As mentioned before, the Ethereum Network has its own digital currency called Ether. Ethers can be mined similar to Bitcoins. During mining, Ether blocks are found using complex computer operations in the Ethereum network. For the newcomers among you, this may not be the ideal solution for Ether. It is easier to acquire Ether in a crypto exchange. Coinbase and Kraken are quite popular options for such. Here you can exchange your Euros at the current daily exchange rate for Ether. Of course, if you own Bitcoins you can also trade Bitcoins for Ethers. Your Ether can be saved in a wallet below.

Here are some different options to choose from.

For the more advanced among you, a paper wallet might be the safest option.

For beginners, the page myetherwallet.com may be more appropriate. There, you can create your virtual wallet for free with your wallet address. From the crypto exchange, you can then send your newly purchased Ether to that wallet.

As another safe wallet option, you should take a closer look at so-called hardware wallets. These wallets are similar to USB sticks and store your cryptocurrencies within such. For this, we can especially recommend the Ledger Nano S Wallet.

As a software developer, there is also the question of how you can become part of Ethereum yourself and develop your own applications. As mentioned above, Ethereum is an open source network — meaning anyone can become part of the community and develop products for free. A good starting point for interested developers is this website. This is the official Ethereum Beginners Guide for software developers.

What does the future look like for Ethereum?

The development of applications using the Ethereum Blockchain increased dramatically in 2017. With the strong growth of digital applications requiring Blockchain technology, the Ethereum network is also expected to experience further growth in popularity in 2018 and beyond.

Of course, with the increase in popularity and the development of more and more Ethereum applications, there are also some issues and challenges that the Ethereum team needs to overcome. The biggest challenge is to increase the number of confirmed transactions per second. Bitcoin can currently confirm about three to four transactions per second. Ethereum can currently confirm 20 transactions per second. At the moment, however, crypto-transactions are not yet a mass phenomenon and are only carried out by a minority of Internet users.

That being said, as Blockchain and Blockchain network transactions become a mainstream trend, it will be necessary to be able to handle thousands of transactions per second. To enable this, the Ethereum Developer Team is working on a technology called Casper. According to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, this Casper technology will be available in the summer of 2018. With this Casper technology, up to one million transactions per second can be confirmed. From then on, it is also possible to handle mini transactions via the Ethereum Blockchain. The year 2018 brings a lot of excitement in any case, and hopefully a lot of progress within the Ethereum Blockchains.

The real sign of our times is Japan’s new all-girl pop group Kasotsuka Shojo, each of whose eight members represents a different cryptocurrency. They’re holding their first cryptopop concert in Tokyo this Friday.



The group, whose name translates to Virtual Currency Girls, was recently launched by Japanese entertainment company Cinderella Academy, which also manages several other popular groups, to educate the public about the crypto world, in song. Each girl in the group represents a different currency such as bitcoin, ethereum or ripple, which can be identified from their fuzzy masks. It isn’t clear how French maid outfits symbolize cryptocurrency or blockchain technology—but they’re popular costumes in Japan’s anime and cosplay circles.

“We want to promote the idea through entertainment that virtual currencies are not just a tool for speculation but are a wonderful technology that will shape the future,” said the group’s leader Rara Naruse, 18, in an online statement. Naruse symbolizes bitcoin cash.

Payment for the Virtual Currency Girls debut concert Friday (Jan. 12) in Tokyo will only be accepted via cryptocurrencies, according to the band’s official site (link in Japanese). The group’s first song, “The Moon and Virtual Currencies and Me,” appears to take its inspiration from the warnings issued by various regulators in recent weeks—it’s a lecture on online security and watching out for fraudulent crypto businesses. Listen for yourself:

Bitcoin has been recognized as a legal form of currency in Japan, which, at one stage, accounted for the biggest share of global bitcoin trading. Tokyo-based BitFlyer is one of the world’s largest crypto-exchange operators. The dramatic rise in bitcoin’s price this past year will boost Japan’s GDP growth by 0.3%, according to a recent research note from Nomura.

The digital currency hit a record high of $1,417.38 before paring some of those gains, according to CoinDesk, a website that tracks the prices of the digital currency. Ethereum is up over 13,000 percent in the last year. Ethereum is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization behind bitcoin, with a value of $131.5 billion, CoinDesk data shows. The digital coin is backed by a blockchain, much like bitcoin, but the technology is slightly different and aimed at a specific use case: smart contracts. Many see it as a cryptocurrency with a real world use because of large companies that are experimenting with the technology. A consortium called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which includes companies like Microsoft and JP Morgan, is looking to develop applications using the Ethereum blockchain.

There also appears to be a sense of investors looking at alternative digital coins to make a profit. Ripple recently surged to a record high before plunging. Some of that money may have been funneled into ethereum. As of 8:00 a.m. London time on Wednesday, over 43 percent of purchases of ethereum had been made using bitcoin, according to CryptoCompare. Last year also saw just over $3.7 billion raised via initial coin offerings (ICO), a process where a company can raise money by issuing a new digital token.

This fall in prices comes after two major cryptocurrencies hit record highs. Ripple hit an all-time high of $3.84 on January 4.

Reuters reported that the proposed ban on cryptocurrency trading was announced after ""enough discussion"" with other government agencies including the nation's Finance Ministry and financial regulators. Major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are often traded at a premium on South Korean exchanges, meaning that they are at a higher price versus other exchanges in the U.S. or Europe for example. Earlier this week, industry data provider CoinMarketCap even removed some South Korean exchanges from the way it calculates the prices of cryptocurrencies, citing ""extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world."" Regulators are taking a keener interest in the cryptocurrency world. Reuters reported Thursday that the U.S. Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing next month with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The South Korean government is preparing a bill to ban trading in all cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said Thursday.

""There are great concerns regarding virtual money,"" Park told reporters in Seoul. ""The government has repeatedly warned about the fact that it is a very dangerous transaction but the message has not properly been delivered,"" he said.

Park didn't give details on when the bill would be introduced in parliament. But his comments prompted bitcoin to fall sharply. The digital currency, which is known for its volatility, dropped around 14% before recovering slightly in early afternoon trading in Asia.

Ethereum, another cryptocurrency hugely popular in South Korea, also fell 14%.

A frenzy of cryptocurrency trading swept South Korea last year, helping propel huge gains in bitcoin and other virtual coins. The country has accounted for as much as a fifth of global bitcoin trade on some days in recent months.

But the country's government has been moving toward greater regulation of digital currencies in recent weeks, introducing a new law in late December that gives authorities the power to shut down bitcoin exchanges.

Such moves remain a possibility, Park said, before likening cryptocurrency trading to speculation and gambling.

""The government's basic position is that virtual currency trading is extremely dangerous and the bubble may burst anytime,"" he said.

Another exchange, Coinone, is being investigated on suspicion of facilitating illegal gambling through cryptocurrencies, South Korean police told CNNMoney.

Coinone couldn't be reached for comment.

Don’t tell that to investors in XRP, though. In the last month the currency owned by Ripple, a company that bills itself as using blockchain technology to build the payment system of the future, soared in price by a whopping 700 percent. XRP’s overall value pushed up to nearly $150 billion and briefly made Chris Larsen, Ripple’s cofounder, one of the richest people on the planet.

This piece first appeared in our new twice-weekly newsletter, Chain Letter, which covers the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Sign up here – it’s free!

The exuberance was fueled, at least in part, by a belief that anyone buying up XRP was getting in on the next Bitcoin. But for some it could end up as a very expensive lesson that what they bought into is a different animal altogether.

To begin with, Bitcoin relies on a network of “miners” running code that validates transactions and keeps the currency secure. Bitcoins are released as rewards for this mining and act as an incentive to keep the network running (see ""What Bitcoin Is, and Why It Matters""). In Ripple’s setup there are no miners; all 100 billion coins of XRP that exist were created when the network launched in 2012. Its creators kept 20 billion and gave the rest to the company. Since then, Ripple has been “methodically” distributing tokens to clients, but it still holds nearly 50 billion in an escrow account.

That’s not all. Ripple uses a novel consensus algorithm (PDF) to validate transactions, and it recommends that clients use a list of identified, trusted participants to validate their transactions. This stands in stark contrast to Bitcoin, where anyone can become a miner.",2018-01-11,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-bitcoin-china-idUSKBN1F10BU,"MONTREAL/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s Bitmain Technologies is eyeing bitcoin mining sites in Quebec, a company spokesman told Reuters, as expectations of a potential Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrency mining make the energy-rich Canadian province an attractive alternative.

China has grown into one of the world’s biggest sources of cryptocurrency mining but there are signs Beijing is increasing scrutiny of the sector’s players and may ask local authorities to regulate their power use. Bitmain Technologies, operator of some of the largest mining farms in the country, is among several companies looking to expand overseas.

Bitmain spokesman Nishant Sharma said in an e-mail on Friday that the company was looking at sites in Quebec and is in talks with regional power authorities in the province. It is also planning to expand in Switzerland.

Bitcoin mining consumes large quantities of energy because it uses computers to solve complex math puzzles to validate transactions in the cryptocurrency, which are written to the blockchain, or digital ledger. The first miner to solve the problem is rewarded in bitcoin and the transaction is added to the blockchain.

While Beijing has not issued any official edict on the bitcoin mines, two Chinese miners told Reuters that local authorities had grown more unwilling to allow expansion and had started to shut down some mines in late 2017, as China clamped down on cryptocurrencies.

Last September, Chinese authorities banned so-called initial coin offerings and ordered Beijing-based cryptocurrency exchanges to halt trading.

“We, and from what I understand many of our peers, are already making plans to go overseas,” said Li Wei, chief executive of ZQMiner, a Wuhan-based company that sells bitcoin mining equipment and has mines in three Chinese provinces.

Globally, regulators are increasingly voicing concerns about cryptocurrencies, which are not backed by any central bank, because of their volatility and worries about risks to investors. China, which has strict capital controls, is also worried that cryptocurrencies could facilitate illegal fund flows and breed financial risks.

In Canada, Hydro Quebec described a potential sales pipeline of around 30 large cryptocurrency miners after a campaign by the public utility to attract data centres to the province triggered a flurry of interest from bitcoin miners in 2017.

“Of the world’s top five largest blockchain players, we have at least three or four,” David Vincent, director of business development at Hydro Quebec distribution, said in an interview on Wednesday.

MANITOBA ALSO ATTRACTIVE

Stephane Paquet, a vice president of Montreal International, which promotes foreign investment in the province’s largest city, has called Quebec a place for “green bitcoin.”

According to Hydro Quebec, the province has an energy surplus equivalent to 100 Terawatt hours over 10 years. One terawatt hour powers 60,000 homes in Quebec during a year.

Neither Hydro Quebec nor Montreal International would divulge names of interested miners. Vincent said companies are eyeing operations from about 20 megawatts, the size of a data centre, to sites as large as 300 megawatts, about the size of a small aluminum smelter.

He expects some of the large companies to begin operations in Quebec this year and in early 2019. Bitmain’s spokesman said that Bitmain has been mining in Canada since 2016, but did not say where.

The challenge for miners is finding existing facilities in Quebec that already have buildings and other infrastructure in place to use the large energy supply required for cryptocurrency mining. A new facility would take about a year to be operational.

“We have the energy available,” said Eric Filion, customer vice-president for Hydro Quebec’s distribution division. “It’s a question of finding land and buildings quickly.”

Hydro Quebec, which offers some of the lowest electricity rates in North America, charges an industrial rate of $0.0248 per kilowatt hour (Kwh) (2.48 U.S. cents) for data centres and $0.0394/kwh (3.94 U.S. cents) for cryptocurrency customers. Customers would have to assume other start-up costs, Filion said.

Textiles and pulp and paper factories are particularly attractive to cryptocurrency mining companies.

Alain Bourdages, a company vice president at Montreal-based Resolute Forest Products Inc RFP.N, said by phone that the company has been contacted by cryptocurrency companies about possibly sharing their existing production sites, or ones that are no longer in use.

“We are looking at this prudently,” he said. “It’s an interesting opportunity that could generate value.”

In central Canada’s Manitoba province, provincial government-owned utility Manitoba Hydro has fielded more than 100 inquiries from cryptocurrency miners in the past three months about specific sites, a company spokesman said.

The interest includes North American brokers who represent Chinese investors, attracted by Manitoba’s cheap power and potential reduced cooling requirements, spokesman Bruce Owen said. It is working with two large-scale cryptocurrency operations that want to set up in Manitoba, he said.

Manitoba’s power rates may soon rise, however. Manitoba Hydro is asking the province’s utilities board to approve a rate increase of 7.9 percent across the board, effective April 1, 2018. That is far larger than utility rate changes proposed last year in other provinces, including 0.7 percent in Quebec, according to Manitoba Hydro data.",2018-01-12 04:23:19+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/11/warren-buffett-watcher-were-near-the-top-of-a-bitcoin-bubble.html,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is right about cryptocurrencies, and the price of bitcoin will be much lower in the near future, a veteran investor told CNBC on Thursday.

Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, warned on Wednesday the recent craze over bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies won't end well. But Buffett added he would not take a short position on bitcoin futures.

""I wouldn't bet against Warren,"" said John Rogers Jr., chairman and CEO at Ariel Investments. ""At the same time, I continue to see everywhere I go, everyone's talking about [cryptocurrencies]. College students, business school students.""

""When everyone's talking about it, it makes me feel like we're probably near the top of a bubble,"" Rogers said in an interview on ""Squawk Box."" ""I agree with Warren.""

Rogers, a longtime Buffett watcher and Berkshire shareholder, said investors could see the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ""much, much lower"" in about five years.

Buffett's bitcoin comments to CNBC on Wednesday came a day after J.P. Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon backpedaled his earlier criticisms of cryptocurrencies. In September, Dimon called bitcoin a fraud.

That said, you can’t exactly walk into a KFC location in Canada and pay with crypto at the cash register.

Instead, the company is accepting Bitcoin via BitPay as one of the options through an online check-out page. The Bitcoin Bucket will be delivered directly to the customer’s address (the product also carries a $5 fee), according to the check-out process on its website.

Indeed, the company appears to be jumping on the publicity bandwagon surrounding cryptocurrencies. However, unlike some public-traded firms that have seen their stock prices soar after announcing some kind of tie-in with the tech, the move doesn’t seem to have had much of an effect on the price for Yum!

Currently based out of San Francisco, Jackson works as a product manager but is still active in the cryptocurrency space. Jackson has holdings in various cryptocurrencies, including less than $50 worth of Dogecoin. You can follow him on Twitter and YouTube.

When I jokingly tweeted about “investing in Dogecoin” in late 2013, I never imagined that the tongue-in-cheek cryptocurrency I had just brought into the world would still be around in the year 2018, let alone hit a $2 billion market cap like it just did over the weekend.

Last year saw an explosion of interest and investment in cryptocurrencies across the board, so it’s tempting to see 2017 as the best year to date for the industry. But I feel it is shortsighted to mistake this explosive growth as being sustainable—in fact, I feel 2017 was arguably the worst year for cryptocurrencies yet. To understand why, let’s revisit what I learned from the currency I created as a joke.

Dogecoin started as a parody of the multitude of alternative cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins,” flooding the market at the time. As interest in Dogecoin grew through social media and an active Reddit community, it went on to become an educational gateway for many people dipping their toes into the world of cryptocurrencies for the first time, thanks to its low price and welcoming community.

In 2013, the vision for the future of cryptocurrencies seemed relatively clear: To deliver a peer-to-peer alternative to cash that, through decentralization, did away with the need for trust in financial institutions, which the 2008 crisis showed to be unscrupulous, and often corrupt. Bitcoin, which ignited the cryptocurrency movement in 2009, brought real technical innovation to the table in achieving this vision. Back then, I hoped that through the power of community, a project such as Dogecoin may help drive further awareness of and innovation in that technology.

However, as I quickly learned, a passionate community of people throwing around money is like blood in the water to the shark-like scammers and opportunists who, in late 2014, co-opted the Dogecoin community and fleeced its members for millions of dollars.

Read More: The Guy Who Ruined Dogecoin

By 2015, the energy in the community had changed—those who got burned by the scammers began to disappear and the community’s interest in Dogecoin declined, as did its price in US dollars. At the same time, confidence in Bitcoin was shaken: hacks and scams dominated the news cycle, and merchant adoption failed to grow at forecasted rates. Despite these events, huge sums of venture capital continued to pour into fresh cryptocurrency companies backed only by buzzword-laden websites and lacking any discernible business model.

In light of all this, in 2015 I decided to back away from any involvement in Dogecoin and cryptocurrency in general. I handed development of Dogecoin over to a team of community members that I trusted. I made it clear at the time that any Dogecoin I previously held—the small amount I have now came from people “tipping” me after I left—had been sent to charity drives run by the community, and that I’d made zero profit from my involvement with the project.

I saw the space being overrun by opportunists looking to make a buck, rather than people investing in evolving the technology (which, even back then, we knew was facing real technical issues.) Over the following two years, I monitored the space from afar. What I noticed was a shift away from developing the core technology powering these networks to churning out shiny new projects that shoehorned in “blockchain” wherever possible.

There is a popular saying in financial markets along the lines of, “When your taxi driver is telling you to buy stock, you know it’s time to sell.” Basically, when a stranger with (presumably) little experience in the stock market is giving you tips, it’s an indication that the market is too popular for its own good. Having been out of the cryptocurrency space for two years, in early 2017 when my Uber drivers started talking to me about Ethereum, I knew we were entering a renewed period of speculative crypto-mania.

No trend better exemplified this than the “ICO,” or Initial Coin Offering. In 2017, thousands of fledgling companies collectively raised over one billion dollars (one ICO alone raised $700 million in December) in exchange for virtual “tokens” which buyers could then trade immediately on a secondary market—often for a large profit. I began having flashbacks to the scams from the Dogecoin days. For example, a token called PlexCoin raised nearly $15 million in an ICO last year before Canadian and US regulators froze the creator’s assets and a Canadian court sentenced him to jail.

These concerning observations have led me back into the cryptocurrency space to help educate my co-workers, friends, and family who are asking me if they should pour their money into cryptocurrencies. Hopefully, if I do my job, they will better understand the potential pitfalls of doing so.

Over the past year we’ve seen the collective market cap of all cryptocurrency assets balloon to more than $700 billion USD, largely because of speculative trading. Everyday, it seems there is a fresh news article about the 20 year-old who became a millionaire in Bitcoin. Or in the case of my own creation—Dogecoin—how a currency that hasn’t received a software update since 2015 briefly passed a $2 billion market cap ($1.5 billion at the time of writing).

Dogecoin’s valuation is the result of market mania that has resulted in inexperienced investors buying up low-priced assets on a whim, hoping that they will follow Bitcoin’s meteoric trajectory. This irrational enthusiasm, coupled with large players manipulating largely unregulated markets, has resulted in a weekly cycle of rallies and crashes across just about every crypto asset. While the Dogecoin community on Reddit has seen a recent uptick in participation, the majority of new discussion seems to fixate on the USD price and speculation as to when it will rally once again.

It’s great to see mainstream excitement about cryptocurrency, but the continued focus on price and potential to “get rich quick” distracts from the laudable goals that projects like Bitcoin set out with. Even more importantly, the underlying technology is still facing technical challenges related to scaling that need to be addressed. At the time of writing, it costs an average of of $30 to send any amount of money using the Bitcoin network. At the same time, a token that touts itself as “the blockchain solution for the global dental industry” has just surpassed a $1 billion market cap. Something isn’t right here.

At the same time, it seems like Bitcoin’s original anti-establishment principles are being diluted even further. We’re seeing money pouring into the industry from large institutional traders, and Bitcoin futures contracts—basically betting on whether Bitcoin’s price will go up or down—have begun trading on Wall Street. Which leaves me asking: what happened to removing the supposedly corrupt financial institutions from the table?

Given the immense price increases and media hype, there's a tendency to see 2017 as the best year for cryptocurrencies yet, but I would argue the opposite. In many ways, 2017 marked the year that cryptocurrency stopped being about technologically innovative peer-to-peer cash and instead essentially became a new, unregulated penny stock market. 2017 was also the year that the very institutions Bitcoin originally sought to dismantle have begun to co-opt it for profit.

Still, I can’t concede that it’s game over for cryptocurrencies. It’s difficult to predict how much the current crypto bubble will inflate, or when it’ll burst (not if). The burning question on my mind is this: Once the cryptocurrency price bubble pops and takes all the hype with it, will the community be able to recover the energy it needs to build real, innovative technology once again?",,,,,,,

A new J-pop girl group from Japan is capitalizing on the recent hype surrounding bitcoin and singing about cryptocurrencies, as spotted by Quartz.

The group’s name is Kasotsuka Shojo, which translates as Virtual Currency Girls. Each one of the eight members represents a different cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Cardano. The women are outfitted in maid dresses and lucha libre-style masks that denote the currency they represent.

“We want to promote the idea through entertainment that virtual currencies are not just a tool for speculation but are a wonderful technology that will shape the future,” said the group’s 18-year-old leader Rara Naruse in a press statement.

Japan passed laws last April that recognize bitcoin as legal tender, and cryptocurrency trade in the country accounts for around half of global trade volume. The band itself was started by entertainment company Cinderella Academy to educate the public about cryptocurrencies. Cinderella Academy also manages other J-pop bands.

Kasotsuka Shojo’s debut single is called “The Moon and Virtual Currencies and Me” and is a blistering electro-pop song that warns listeners to be aware of fraud and to maintain their security online.

Earlier this week, the South Korean Justice Ministry announced that it was preparing legislation to close the country’s online exchanges amid a speculative boom in cryptocurrencies. That shot across the bow was paired with the news that tax authorities were investigating at least some of the exchanges in Korea, and in the hours to come.

Yet the proposal drew swift pushback from within the South Korean government – the president’s office, in particular, said no move is “finalized” as of yet – as well as cryptocurrency supporters and traders in the country who cried foul as the statements sparked a fall in cryptocurrency prices.

The public backlash against the proposed move appears to be accelerating. On the Korean president’s Blue House website, more than 4,000 petitions have been filed related to “virtual currencies” since Jan. 10.

One petition asking the Minister of Justice to step down in light of the move received more than 30,000 signatures on its own. According to Reuters, one petition alone has attracted more than 100,000 signatures and the website itself became inaccessible at one point due to excessive traffic.

Comments on the government’s website included a petition from a user who claimed to have lost money due to the Justice Ministry’s saber-rattling.

Another petition compared cryptocurrency trading with the stock market, but claimed the latter is much more speculative.

Yet another petition struck a supportive note on the development of new rules but called for the government to consult with the wider cryptocurrency community before implementing any such rules.

Opposition pushback

Other members of the Korean political scene are reportedly crying foul as well.

A new report from Korean daily newspaper The Hankyoreh states that leaders of several opposition parties are moving to criticize what they deem a unilateral crackdown without any discussion or debate.

One opposition lawmaker said the ban was not a government position, but rather one that the Ministry of Justice and, possibly the president, hold themselves.

The lawmaker continued (according to a translated statement):

“The government announcement should be based on detailed reviews and coordination. If there is a problem, we should warn and prepare in advance.”

Path toward regulation

In recent months, the government has made efforts to tamp down on what it refers to as speculation surrounding cryptocurrencies.

These efforts included new regulations for banks conducting transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges. On Jan. 8, regulators inspected six banks to ensure compliance with the new regulations, which included strict know-your-customer identification rules, among other measures.

However, rather than comply with the new rules, some banks said they would simply cease trading with cryptocurrency exchanges altogether, according to the Korea Times.

South Korea’s largest bank, Shinhan Bank, said on Friday that it would be closing down the virtual currency accounts it offers in order to comply with new regulations surrounding their use.

An official from Shinhan said the bank had initially built a system to comply with the new regulations before deciding to just de-risk.

“We’ve developed a system to introduce identifying virtual [currency] account customers in accordance with the government’s efforts to curb the cryptocurrency craze. However, we decided to scrap the service enabling the trade of digital tokens which has become a serious social issue,” the representative told the publication.

The former hedge fund executive said that while there are existing laws to track the use of cryptocurrencies, he is worried about some of bitcoin's usage.

""We want to make sure that bad people cannot use these currencies to do bad things,"" Mnuchin said.

The Treasury Secretary also said that there was no need for a ""digital dollar"" or an established crypto alternative to the US dollar.

Mnuchin also hit on a variety of policy topics. He said:

There will be no shutdown — he said either Congress will pass a full funding bill by the January 19 deadline or a short-term extension.

DMM’s Crypto Exchange Launched

Japanese internet and entertainment conglomerate DMM Group has launched a cryptocurrency exchange under the brand name DMM Bitcoin. The platform began trading on Thursday January 11.

To commemorate the grand opening, the exchange is giving away 1,000 yen (~$US9) to all customers who open a new account during the campaign period between January 11 to March 11.

Customers can trade on their PC or use an Android or iOS app. The platform supports bitcoin (BTC), litecoin (LTC), ether (ETH), ethereum classic (ETC), nem (XEM), bitcoin cash (BCH), and ripple (XRP). Fourteen currency pairs are available for trading. In addition to the 7 coins trading for yen, 7 crypto-to-crypto trading pairs are offered; they are ETH/BTC, ETC/ETH, XEM/BTC, XRP/BTC, LTC/BTC, ETC/BTC and BCH/BTC.

According to DMM’s announcement, the exchange is using a trading platform provided by Simplex Inc. called “Simplex Cryptocurrency.” This platform offers trading tools for general investors, business management systems, and a dealing system.

Simplex has been providing securities and FX trading systems to major banks and financial services companies such as SBI Holdings, GMO Group, Nomura Securities, Matsui Securities, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Bank, and Money Partners Group. The company recently started offering a cryptocurrency trading system and DMM Group is its first customer for the new service.

Another DMM’s Exchange Coming Soon

In addition, a subsidiary of DMM Group is launching a new cryptocurrency exchange. Next Currency Inc announced earlier this week that it has filed with the Japanese financial authority to register a new exchange called Cointap.

Planned to launch this Spring, Next Currency described, “Cointap is a service that allows you to easily buy and sell virtual currencies from smartphones,” adding that it is “best suited for those who want to start virtual currency transactions such as bitcoins.” Furthermore, the company claims:

Since virtual currency exchanges so far are centered on services for people with knowledge and investment experience of virtual currency, they are fashionable but difficult to understand and difficult to use.

Citing that there are many inexperienced investors who do not know how to buy or sell, the DMM subsidiary explained Cointap will be tailored for investors entering the market for the first time.

Industry experts say the online money cannot be defined as a cryptocurrency due to the way it is mined. Critics say Ripple should not be included on sites such as CoinMarketCap as it is misleading. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee said: “XRP is NOT a crypto-currency.” Bitcoins are created through miners who run code that validate transactions and keeps the currency secure.

Mining is the processing of transactions in the digital currency system, in which the records of current bitcoin transactions, known as a block, are added to the record of past transactions, known as the blockchain. Ripple’s setup has no miners, as all 100billion coins were created when the network launched in 2012. The creators kept 20bn for themselves and gave the rest to the company in charge of Ripple, called Ripple Labs. Ripple also requires a more specific computer to validate transactions, and needs the computer to identify itself and obtain permission to participate in the network. On the other hand bitcoin allows any computer to join. This system means that the company controlling Ripple has a large amount of control over it meaning it is not decentralised. Decentralisation is the process of distributing or dispersing power away from a central location or authority.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited is planning its own cryptocurrency, dubbed as JioCoin. Reliance Jio has been instrumental in changing the landscape of India’s telecom sector with its discount offers and very competitive tariffs.

Reliance Industries Limited is a Fortune 500 company and the largest private sector corporation in India.

According to a recent news report, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd plans to create its own cryptocurrency, JioCoin. “The company plans to hire 50 young professionals with average age of 25 years for Akash Ambani to lead. There are multiple applications of blockchain (for the company). The team would work on various blockchain products.”

Akash Ambani is the son of Reliance Jio chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man whose net worth reportedly tops $40 billion.

A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Constantly growing as ""completed"" blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order. It allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is the most popular application of the blockchain technology. In fact, it is bitcoin which introduced blockchain to the world. Reliance Jio plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency. In the present time, there are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies with a combined market capitalization of almost $700 billion, with bitcoin dominating 43%.

This project is in line with Reliance Jio's mission wherein it “promises to shape the future of India by providing end-to-end digital solutions for businesses, institutions and households and seamlessly bridging the rural-urban divide.”

India has seen a phenomenal rise in interest among its people for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the past year. The country offers the perfect conditions for adoption of such technology. India is the home to the second-largest population (1.2 billion) in the world with 63% of its population under age 35. This, when combined with the fast-growing smartphone and internet penetration amid a digital revolution, makes India a fertile land for innovative digital technology.

While the young and tech-savvy people in India are interested in indulging in these emerging technologies, the stance of the government currently continues to be cautious.

In December 2017, the Reserve Bank of India reinstated its cautious stance towards bitcoin and virtual currencies. The apex bank issued the first of such note in December 2013. In February 2017, it clarified that it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with bitcoin or any virtual currency.

In January 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jailey said, “The government is examining the matter. A Committee under the chairmanship of the Economic Affairs Department Secretary is deliberating over all issues related to cryptocurrencies to propose specific actions to be taken... Instead of taking any knee-jerk action, let's wait for the report of this committee.”

While regulatory ambiguity continues, some of the biggest banks in the country, including State Bank of India and ICICI Bank, have been experimenting on the use-cases of blockchain.

Virtual Currency Girls’ First Concert

Japanese 8-member idol group Virtual Currency Girls performed their first concert in Tokyo on Friday. The group was formed last week, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

The show, which lasted about half an hour, began with each member briefly introducing themselves as a cryptocurrency. They are bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), monacoin (MONA), neo (NEO), nem (XEM), cardano (ADA), and ripple (XRP). The group’s leader is reportedly Naruse Rara who represents bitcoin cash.

After a round of introductions, the group launched into their opening song called “The Moon, Cryptocurrencies and Me”. It incorporates warning messages of the risks of cryptocurrency trading as well as other basic security reminders such as “Be careful about your password! Don’t use the same one!,” Reuters described. Another line says “It’s hell if you buy at a high price!” and “Don’t underestimate the market,” according to the Financial Times.

The girls wear maid costumes which “aim to raise the group’s popularity with the use of a globally recognizable ‘uniform’,” Naruse explained.

Spreading Crypto Knowledge

The group explained that they are not about promoting investments, but rather to educate people about cryptocurrencies in an entertaining way. “We want to promote the idea through entertainment that virtual currencies are not just a tool for speculation but are a wonderful technology that will shape the future,” the Mirror quoted the girls.

Referring to cryptocurrencies, Naruse said at the concert, “Our brains are fried as we are studying every day,” Arab News reported and quoted her saying:

They’re so convenient you kind of have to wonder why we didn’t have them [cryptocurrencies] before…We want everyone to learn more about them.

Getting Fans into Crypto

“All merchandise sold at the venue is paid for in bitcoin, as are concert tickets and the members’ salaries,” Reuters noted.

The group also held a “meet-and-greet” event, which is common for idol groups. “Fans could take a picture, shake hands and even chat with one of the performers for 0.001 bitcoin (about $15),” according to Sputnik. After the show, “several fans admitted that they [the group] had given them ‘a good introduction’ to the world of cryptocurrencies,” the news outlet added. In addition, Reuters quoted Kensaku Nagao, a 46-year-old fan of the group, saying:

I know absolutely nothing about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but I want to make sure I have some on hand for further concerts and to buy merchandise.

Another fan, 43-year-old Hiroshi Kasahara, who runs an ad agency, said: “I have been trading stocks and forex but not bitcoin or other virtual currencies as I was a bit scared of them…But [now] I feel like opening an account” if the group accepts payment only in bitcoin, he was quoted by Arab News.

“I may well give it a try as it can be a catalyst to make life more convenient and fun,” said Makoto Sato, a 42-year-old office worker who said the idol group had given him “a good introduction” to the world of cryptocurrencies.

Bank Indonesia, Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia’s central bank, has issued perhaps its bluntest statement yet on curbing the use of cryptocurrency, affirming a hardening stance on the popularity of what it refers to as “virtual currency” such as bitcoin.

Bank Indonesia Warns All Parties

Bank Indonesia Warns To All Parties To Not Sell, Buy or Trade Virtual Currency is the title of today’s missive from Bank Indonesia by way of its Department of Communications. It “affirms that virtual currency including bitcoin is not recognized as a valid payment instrument, so it is prohibited to be used as a means of payment in Indonesia.”

Bank Indonesia (BI) is the Republic’s central bank, and as such it has been unusually active and belligerent with regard to cryptocurrency. Its governor issued statements late last year causing regional media to urge retail holders to sell back into fiat ahead of a ban. That followed Fall’s shutdown of bitcoin payment providers and businesses restructuring in an effort to get ahead of coming regulation. And just prior, BI had yet again reaffirmed its distaste for crypto, pushing advocates to insist the bank was denying a marvel of technological innovation. BI’s pronouncements have routinely contrasted with impressions on the street, as Indonesians do seem to have an appetite for the decentralized currency.

BI wants it crystal clear all obligations paid in money or “other financial transactions conducted in the Territory of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia shall be obliged using Rupiah.” Decrees of this sort appear to be driving Indonesians away from above-ground exchanges, for obvious reasons, and into more peer-to-peer arrangements such as Localbitcoins.

Stern Reminder

“Ownership of virtual currency is very risky and full of speculation because there is no authority responsible,” the central banker continues, “there is no official administrator, there is no underlying asset underlying virtual currency price and trading value is very volatile so vulnerable to the risk bubble and prone to be used as a means of washing money and financing of terrorism, so that it can affect the stability of the financial system and harm the public. Therefore, Bank Indonesia warns all parties not to sell, buy or trade virtual currency,” it concludes.

“Bank Indonesia,” they sternly remind, “prohibits all payment system service providers (principals, switching organizers, clearing organizers, final settlement providers, issuers, acquirers, payment gateways, electronic wallet operators, fund transfer providers) and Financial Technology providers in Indonesia both Banks and Institutions Bank to process payment transactions with virtual currency,” citing laws and regulations.

Undoubtedly, BI’s 13 January 2018 reminder is to ride the wave of publicity South Korean regulators garnered by floating the word “ban.” Mainstream press ran with the passing idea, and prices regionally as well as internationally dropped double digits, and fast.

As of this writing, the country’s most popular exchange, PT Bit Coin Indonesia, closing in on a million users, remains up and running.

No Crypto Investments Allowed

The Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (CVM) on Friday issued a circular addressed to all officers responsible for the administration and management of investment funds in the country.

It states that direct acquisitions of cryptocurrencies by investment funds “are not allowed.” Reuters elaborated: “Cryptocurrencies cannot be considered financial assets, regulator CVM ruled, in effect barring funds from investing directly in assets such as bitcoin.”

Furthermore, local funds interested in investing in cryptocurrencies indirectly by taking a stake in foreign funds should await further clarification from the regulator. The circular reads:

We consider it appropriate for managers and investment funds to await further and more conclusive manifestation of this oversight on the subject to structure the indirect investment in cryptocurrencies as described, or even in other alternative forms that seek this kind of exposure to risk.

Crypto Regulation Being Discussed

The Brazilian Chamber of Deputies established a special committee in May of last year to discuss the regulation of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. Seven public hearings were held in the second half of 2017 to debate this topic.

In December, the CVM and the Central Bank of Brazil published a joint statement warning about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies.

In the same month, “House Representative Expedito Netto made formal recommendations that would essentially ban bitcoin from being traded, created, held for third parties, or exchanged for fiat currency unless legal permission is granted,” Value Walk described. While recommending a penalty of 1-6 months’ jail time or a fine for violations, Netto did not clarify what “permission” mean.

At the December public hearing held at the Chamber of Deputies, the executive manager of Banco do Brasil’s Digital Affairs Directorate, Jonatas Ramalho, defended the creation of rules that would allow a more favorable environment for the use of cryptocurrencies. According to him, “The regulation of bitcoin and similar [assets] could open the way for banks to offer products and services aimed at cryptocurrencies.”

The exchange was scheduled to go offline on Jan. 11 at 5 UTC for a predicted two hours for a system upgrade. As the maintenance time offline grew to more than two days, Kraken only sporadically updated their status page with promises of progress and an explanation of a bug found in the production environment.

Kraken users had already been unhappy with the crypto exchange before the upgrade delay, citing difficulties placing exchanges and frequent connection errors on the site.

The highlight or lowlight of the time offline was Kraken’s update on Jan. 12, 3:46 UTC that they had sent their engineers home to rest rather than launching immediately.

The update reads:

“We are close but rather than launch immediately ahead of the team passing out; we will push off a bit to get some rest and be able to better monitor systems and react to problems following launch. Unfortunately, this means several more hours of delay.”

With their return online, Kraken announced that unleveraged trading is free until the end of the month on both their Twitter and their site. The site has been functioning normally since going online, but trading was paused for several hours due to problems displaying order book data that have since been resolved.

Earlier this year, crypto exchange Coinbase also went offline for several hours in May due to a reported degraded performance. Additionally, several other exchanges including Luno, Bitfinex, and Bitstamp experienced delays or went offline for maintenance in December after an influx of new cryptocurrency users inspired by the rising price of Bitcoin (BTC) exponentially increased the volume of traffic.

If you’ve been into cryptocurrencies long enough, you’d know that the price of bitcoin changes very often. There are plenty of bitcoiners who buy the dips and sell the tops, but those plays can have potential risks that people just holding their assets don’t have to face. Now, these types of investors are purchasing small amounts of bitcoin and using a strategy called dollar cost averaging.

Also read: Paul Krugman Is Excited to See Bitcoin Have Issues

Day Trading Bitcoin and Intra-Range Strategies Can Be Risky

Many people know that if you have bitcoins, you can sell them when you think the market has reached resistance or a high that will be followed by a significant dip. It’s at these times you can make some good money flipping bitcoins. For instance, if you purchase BTC at a low entry point and the price gains by 20 percent and you sell the BTC at that high then there’s potential to gain more bitcoins, if it drops back down to any number below the top sale. You can do it just a few times a month, or you can make a career out of trading cryptocurrencies. However, this type of trading technique comes with many risks that can leave traders high and dry. One risk that’s tethered to this kind of exchange is leaving funds on a trading platform that could cease operations in a blink of an eye. Lastly, bitcoin prices don’t follow most people’s predictions, and you may miss the highs and lows and lose significant amounts of funds forecasting the wrong market events.

Dollar-Cost Averaging: The Hodler’s Choice

Investors that are hedging bitcoin like hoarders or ‘hodlers’ for much longer term gains use a strategy called ‘Dollar-Cost Averaging’ (DCA). This technique is used by those who believe in the long-term progress of bitcoin and other digital assets. Using the DCA method means purchasing a fixed dollar amount of bitcoins no matter what the price happens to be. Further, the DCA technique requires purchasing the fixed dollar price using a scheduled calendar as well.

The ‘Hodler’s approach’ is far less stressful than those who day trade or play intra-range strategies. Those who purchase bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies using the DCA technique don’t have to watch the charts all the time or set price alarms so they can catch rises and dips. DCA investors are investing in the digital asset for the long haul, and everyday price volatility is meaningless to the hodler to a degree. Another aspect of buying a fixed dollar amount using a schedule means the investor doesn’t have to transfer funds to an exchange or keep funds there for faster trades. DCA investors can hoard their savings using cold storage and only send when they are ready to sell.

Recurring Purchases

There are a few companies like Coinbase and Blockchain.info, that offer recurring purchases. This means the platform will let you set a desired amount of bitcoin you want to purchase on a set schedule. The service will then deduct funds from your bank account or card listed, and you can acquire bitcoins using the DCA method in a more automated fashion.

Holding Cryptocurrencies for a Long Time Seems to Be Paying Off

Dollar-cost averaging isn’t for everyone, and some people believe buying dips and selling at tops is a far more profitable means of investing. However, most people would agree that DCA is a safer method of investing because it’s less stressful and you don’t have to keep money on an exchange or pay lots of fees to send money to trading platforms.

Basically by using the DCA method users can get an average cost of their overall investment over time. With the way things have been going with cryptocurrencies over the long term just holding digital assets has been a profitable means of investing.

Newbies, experienced adherents and even gurus could find something interesting to upgrade their mastering of the subject. Life hacks from experts, pioneers, trailblazers, those who went through the mills of different crypto experiences themselves- firsthand and as simply put as possible.

Cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) markets are ones of the fastest changing in the world. As soon as the ICO-phenomenon started to gather serious traction at the beginning of 2017, every noticeable cryptocurrency blogger and media mentioned BitcoinTalk as one of the key success components, often referring to it as a source of the most desirable and target audience for any ICO project out there.

All ICOs make announcement posts (ANN-posts) about themselves and majority of them launch their bounty campaigns on BitcoinTalk, while all trustworthy ICO listings require hyperlinks to ANN-posts when onboarding the projects. Thus, it can be said that at the moment, BitcoinTalk is a mandatory de-facto standard for any project doing or planning to do an Initial Coin Offering.

The following guide to BitcoinTalk is based on thorough research on the subject, available information gathered and practical experience. An exclusive collection of knowledge was tested along the story of a startup, which launched its ANN and bounty campaign posts on BitcoinTalk on Monday, Oct. 2. For the full first two weeks of the ICO campaign, no other user acquisition activities were made besides BitcoinTalk in order to receive a full understanding of how the platform worked and how it could help grow the project.

What is BitcoinTalk?

Modern BitcoinTalk is the largest and one of the oldest message boards dedicated to Blockchain and cryptocurrencies on the Internet. It was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto on November 22, 2009, and is a direct successor to his first SourceForge forum, which is now lost.

Initially, BitcoinTalk was a forum where people interested in technical details and everything connected to Bitcoin software could communicate with each other. Now it hosts a lot of different sections covering all the major areas of cryptocurrency world, including one made specifically for ICOs. Thanks to its huge user base (more than 464,000 community members) BitcoinTalk soon became a valuable traffic source for everything connected to cryptocurrency.

What to do right after your post has been published

The setup

In order to be able to publish announcements and bounty posts, you need to have an account on the forum, but if you plan to do a beautiful “branded” post with images, your account should be at least in a rank of Jr. Member, which means having at least 30 activity points. In order to get that, you need to participate in forum’s life – communicate with other people in various forum threads.

BitcoinTalk assigns points using the following scheme:

One publication or comment = one activity point, but as soon as you reach 14 points, your score stops growing for the current two-week period. Despite this fact, your activity is being tracked and your points are being registered, but not assigned to your account at the moment.

At the beginning of the following two-week period, the process starts again – your activity points continue to grow (even if you didn’t do anything during this new period, your previously registered activity points are now being assigned) until you reach next +14 points. This way, in order to gather the aforementioned 30 points you need to actively communicate on the forum for at least four weeks and two days. You need to keep this in mind if you plan to launch your announcement post by a certain date.

Bans

You also need to note that your account might get banned along the way if you do a lot of off-topic posts and change your geo-IP often and inconsistently, so we suggest you start with at least five accounts that you plan to bring to Jr. Member rank. We had four, three of them got banned.

Besides the in-house leveling up of BitcoinTalk accounts, there are two possible solutions to this situation:

Find someone who has an account of Jr. Member rank or higher and ask him to publish your ANN/Bounty post for you, but keep in mind that you will most likely need to update your posts during the campaign, so this person should be eager to help you out all the time;

Buy an account. This method is not forbidden on BitcoinTalk but is not encouraged. You should remember that there is a risk (a rather small one) that your newly bought account can get banned soon after the purchase. You can get banned for a variety of reasons:

– change or regular Geo-IP

– a complaint that accounts that you just bought was stolen

– because some of the forum dwellers are inspecting users who actively communicate in the threads they are interested in, with the goal of finding high ranking accounts with unnatural behavioral patterns (e.g., account was inactive for three months and then started to positively comment in your thread only) in order to report them for unfair thread pumping.

Usually, bans on BitcoinTalk are temporary, but receiving one may hinder your campaign a lot.

In order to minimize the risks, we advise you create your own accounts and grow them till Jr. Member rank. You should start doing so at least one month and two days before your planned ANN-post release date.

Here you can find the complete list of features and restrictions applicable to each account rank.

In case you still want to risk and buy an account, we’ve studied the matter for you. Here are the prices you can encounter on the forums in late November – mid-December*:

Jr. Member – from 30 EUR;

Member – from 56 EUR;

Full Member – from 90 EUR;

Senior Member – from 120 EUR;

Hero Member – from 195 EUR;

Legendary Member – from 310 EUR.

* Note: prices vary a lot, they depend on the vendor and account history, not solely on account rank, but given numbers do provide an actual understanding of the current market state.

Escrows

When buying an account on BitcoinTalk, it is strongly advised to use an escrow service. Escrows are experienced and respected high ranking forum members that act as the third party in your arrangement and guarantee that your deal will be concluded without fraud. Below you can find a list of BitcoinTalk members that could be contacted on the matter of providing escrow services. The list is descending – the man with the highest trust rating is displayed above. The structure is as follows: nickname, commission escrow takes from the deal, minimum reward sum escrow receives in any case*:

OgNasty – 1%, min. 0.01 BTC;

Tomatocage – 1%;

Blazr – 1%, min. 0.01 BTC;

Lyth0s – 1%, min. 0.01 BTC;

bitpop – 0.001 BTC;

Anon136 – 0.9%, min. 0.01 BTC;

TwinWinNerD – 1%, 0.01 BTC;

Dabs – 1%, min. 0.03 BTC.

* openly available numbers, you can try to lower them by contacting any of the mentioned users in personal messages.

ANN-post and everything connected with it

It’s a well-known fact that beautiful imagery sells better than naked text, it engages the user and holds his attention, it can bring additional value and help to favorably position your product against the competition.

On BitcoinTalk you can create both simple and discreet posts, as well as rich and beautiful publications full of images, but there are many nuances that you should know before deciding which type of ANN-post you should go for.

Mobile layout

BitcoinTalk is not a mobile-friendly platform. There is no direct option to make an adaptive ANN/Bounty post design for mobile devices, but default layout is fluid, meaning that all your text and imagery will be scaled down to meet the current resolution requirements. You may take that into account when preparing your design and make the content of your images bigger than needed so that it would look better on mobile phones, but it’s totally up to you.

During the first two weeks after our initial launch, we didn’t do any advertising or bring additional traffic to our website, receiving only what BitcoinTalk has to offer and that what came organically. We saw that most of the traffic came from desktop (more than 85 percent), that's why we dare to conclude that trying to make your ANN-post “mobile-friendly” is an ineffective approach.

Another feature of BitcoinTalk’s fluid layout is that elements that are specifically positioned in a single row. For example, [img][/img][img][/img], when viewing on a mobile device, can break this row and create a second line, despite the fact that there is enough horizontal space for them in the initial row.

How to mark up and test your post

BitcoinTalk, as many other forums use BBcode to markup its content inside the publications. Implementation of BBcode is a rather standard one but restricted. We would even say old to be precise. Working with multilevel ordered and unordered lists, for example, is a more complicated process than it is on modern phpBB/IPB forum-boards.

Post should be marked up and tested in personal messages (My messages → New message). You should send your post layout to yourself or your other account so that no one would complain about you sending spam in personal messages.

Before sending your test message, you can look at its preview-version, which might show you how your post would look like once published, but unfortunately, it’s not completely true. In preview version of the post, CSS styles that are applied to pictures with hyperlinks are different from the ones applied in real post. This can trash your complex layout if you don’t know about it in advance. When a post is published, all pictures wrapped in links receive an additional margin-left: 4px (four transparent pixels are added from the left side of the picture), but you can’t see this effect in the Preview mode.

Here’s an example of this effect in ELIX’s ANN-post:

Now that you know this nuance, all iterations of your post layout should be sent to you in personal messages and afterwards examined in My messages →

Inbox (sent messages do count as published posts and BitcoinTalk uses same CSS styles on them).

During this step, additional nuances that slow down your working speed appear. If you mark up and test your post layout with a freshly registered user, then each time you press Preview or Send Message, you’ll need to enter a captcha (fortunately, it doesn’t change for a few hours, so you would be able to remember it by heart). For new users (<16 activity points) these personal message sending restrictions apply:

One message in six minutes;

Not more than five messages per hour.

Based on this information, we once again strongly advice to create several accounts on BitcoinTalk and in case of encountering this limits, start doing the same thing, but from different account.

Nota bene: Unfortunately, recently BitcoinTalk forced same image-posting policies to personal messages that it uses in publications. This means that if your account rank is lower than Jr. Member, you can publish only text (image tags will be converted into hyperlinks), even in private messages.

How to extract the BBcode of the ANN-post you like

In order to simplify the ANN-post markup process (i.e,. not to make everything from scratch), you can take any post markup as a basis. It’s very easy to do, but generally, people who don’t work with forums don’t know about it.

Let’s say you like the UTRUST post. In order to see its BBcode markup, you need to log in to BitcoinTalk and press the quote button:

As soon as you do that, window with reply comment will appear, where in the body of the text message a BBcode of UTRUST’s ANN-post will be “quoted.” Everything you need is located inside the tags [quote] and [/quote]. Just copy this code and continue to work with it locally:

Images

BitcoinTalk doesn’t host your images, i.e., you can’t upload pictures to their servers when designing a post, like you can on Medium. You can refer to an image that is already uploaded to a server, preferably your own (with the same domain name as your website), using a hyperlink. If you don’t have a personal dedicated server where you store images, or for some reason, you don’t want to do so, you can use image hosting services such as:

This is where another nuance appears – BitcoinTalk Image Proxy. Theoretically, it was designed to block the loading of the images that exceed 2.5 megabytes in size, but in practice, it periodically blocks the rendering of images from different hostings for no apparent reason, showing you the following message: “bitcointalk.org image proxy: invalid image.”

The main problem here is that your ANN-post images can trigger Image Proxy not when they are rendered for the first time, but three days after the publication, making your post look broken (this is exactly what happened to us).

It is advised to upload your complete image set to different hosting services from the very beginning and prepare several BBCode copies of your post with different image links. In case you encounter this Image Proxy behavior, you will be ready to react to this situation by editing the post and instantly changing all broken images to new, working ones – this way you will minimize your reputation risks. In our tests, we found out that it is safer to use Imgur hosting services. This is probably so because Imgur is most popular image hosting service right now and a lot of companies host their ANN and Bounty post images there, so hindering it with Image Proxy is disadvantageous for the forum in whole.

Another thing to note: you can encounter a situation where you open your published post (or sent personal message) and find some images not being rendered at all. This is a standard situation – no need to worry, just refresh the page a few times. This happens a lot and most of the BitcoinTalk commoners know about it, so they will easily refresh your page if needed.

Image optimisation

All beautiful, selling ANN-posts are made of images – some projects use small amounts of pictures, but very large ones, while others use a lot of small images. Because all images are examined by BitcoinTalk Image Proxy, their loading speed isn’t something to be desired. The general rule of thumb here is that the lesser the size of your images, the faster they load and less Image Proxy related problems are encountered.

In order to decrease your image size – they should be optimised, preferably using lossless algorithms.

These services can help you to achieve this goal:

TinyPNG (very easy to use web service that provides good compression results for PNG and JPEG formats);

PNGyu (Windows program that brings good results when dealing with PNG images);

ImageOptim (Mac OS app, works great with PNG and JPEG formats, in majority of cases performs better than all above-mentioned services).

For anyone who wishes to dive deep into this topic, we advise to take a look at these materials:

ImageOptim-CLI – comparative performance analysis of image optimisation tools;

Working with images (RU) – set of articles with detailed instructions from Art. Lebedev Studio employees are describing how to get maximum image quality while achieving minimum size.

Do you really need to bother, how effective this can be? Let’s compare ANN post of our project – Forty Seven Bank and ANN post of Tokenbox. Our image canvas is a lot longer than one of Tokenbox. We have more graphical content.

Forty Seven: 38 images, total file size – 824 kilobytes;

Tokenbox: 8 images, total file size – 2.26 megabytes.

The difference is 2.74 times.

Pros and cons of different ANN post types

In terms of markup specifics, all posts can be divided into four distinct types. Each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages.

Text ANN post

Example – Ethereum Blue.

Advantages:

This type of post is faster and easier to prepare than any other because it only consists of text;

This type of post can be published without having a Jr. Member ranked account, which means that you’ll have to spend less time preparing it, won’t have to buy accounts or ask anyone for help;

This type of post can be translated into other languages very quickly (by means of bounty campaign), which will grant you larger audience coverage in a lot shorter terms. Translators won’t have to mess with your Photoshop files and change the texts on images there;

This type of post is very easy to edit because there is no need to change images in graphical editors;

Translators and community managers responsible for localized ANN and bounty posts of your campaign will be able to update their threads with your changes more promptly, this way new information will be spread out quicker;

Text posts look as good on mobile devices as they do on desktop;

Text posts are loaded faster than any other types of posts.

Disadvantages:

Text posts sell worse than graphical ones: it is harder to subtly highlight important things and show your product at its best. They also hold user attention worse than other types of post;

Text post shows the potential clients that you save money on design and presentation of your product or are incompetent in the field of design/just lazy, – all these things bring potential reputational risks;

It’s hard to make this type of post big enough to fully present your project properly because if you do so, you will have a big canvas of text that no one wants to read when they open your post for the first time. This type of post should be brief, laconic and at the same time capacious;

Posts without images create less “anchor points” with your project and are forgotten more easily.

Simple Graphical ANN Post

Term simple graphical post implies a canvas that almost fully consists of few or even one single image, which is created using some kind of graphical tool. This type of post is laid out using a rule “one image per row.”

Example – UTRUST.

Advantages:

Graphical posts sell a lot better than text ones;

Because image canvas is not tied to forum element formatting rules and capabilities, it is possible to show your product the way you want without meeting any structure and color restrictions. You can highlight important things and format your elements freely.

This type of post allows to effectively use storytelling techniques and correctly inform the users about your project even if they started to “read” your post somewhere in the middle;

With this type of post you can show the audience the skill level of your design and product teams as well as the seriousness of your approach to BitcoinTalk as media channel;

This type of post automatically looks better than most of the text posts created by the competition. It’s also easier to remember it than a plain text one;

This type of post’s layout doesn’t break apart on mobile devices because it has only one image per row.

Disadvantages:

In order to create such post, you need an account of Jr. Member rank or higher;

This type of post requires significantly more time to create;

You need to have people on your team or on freelance that can create a product of high visual quality;

If post images aren't prepared for special slicing, then the unwanted 4px “ladder” will appear during the alternation between simple images and images wrapped in hyperlinks;

Post with big image canvas consisting of large-sized pictures (especially unoptimized ones) takes longer to load than a simple text post;

In order for translators and community managers to be able to create their own localized threads of your ANN or bounty posts, they require up-to-date, properly sliced versions of Photoshop-files with your graphical content openly available to them (this process also has its own nuances that are covered below);

For fast and convenient translation process of your ANN/bounty post, you need to keep an updated version of all your post’s texts in a separate openly available Google Docs file;

All edits take more time to complete because workflow changes from this:

“Open post → make edits → save”;

to this:

“Add changes to image(-s) → save it → upload to server → open post → make edits to post markup → save”;

The previous paragraph is also true to localized versions of your post. Translators would have to go through the same process as you, that’s why you have to regularly update all the Photoshop files and fonts (if needs be) available to translators in open access;

This type of post implies restrictions in layout of images wrapped in links – you’ll either have a “one per row image wrapped in link” layout or a” whole post is an image wrapped in link” layout (most primitive case of simple graphical ANN post). This means that you won’t be able to place four image-links of your team members in a row where each link leads to a different LinkedIn profile.

Complex graphical ANN post

Complex graphical ANN post is a post that is sliced and marked up in such a way that all images NOT covered in links have additional four transparent/background color pixels from the left side and all images that ARE covered in links do not. This type of post can have several image-links placed in one row (e.g., you can have image-links of your documents placed in one horizontal line).

Examples: Forty Seven Bank, eGold

Advantages:

Almost all advantages of simple graphical ANN post;

This type of post may serve as a mini-website inside a forum, where each image is an actual hyperlink leading where you want to go. Horizontal layout of images wrapped in links can help to shorten the length of the canvas while making it more capacious.

It is easier to almost losslessly optimise a large amount of small images and receive significant reduction in size than to optimise fewer, but very large images. The lesser your posts weights, the faster it loads, that’s why this type of post usually loads faster than simple graphical one;

There is no visible “ladder” happening on the edge of the canvas, where simple images alternate with images wrapped in links.

Disadvantages:

Almost all disadvantages of simple graphical ANN post;

Even more time is required to prepare this type of post than is needed to prepare a simple graphical one;

You will have to work with BitcoinTalk background color (#ECEDF3), whether you want to or not, even if it doesn’t suit your design’s color palette;

On mobile devices, horizontally-placed image links can sometimes fall apart and create a second row of images, which breaks your layout.

Hybrid ANN post

Hybrid post in a topic that uses a combination of images and richly formatted text.

Examples: Sintez, BPC, Tokenbox.

Advantages:

May look as good as most graphical posts out there if to take it seriously like VIBERATE did, which means that this type of post can sell

This type of post allows to effectively use storytelling techniques and correctly inform the users about your project even if they started to “read” your post somewhere in the middle

This type of post is easier to translate for bounty campaign participants because most of the text there is not in mages (less work in image editors), which means that localized versions of your ANN post will appear faster. It’s also much easier to maintain this type of post because edits in terms of workflow are usually similar to Text ones.

This type of post usually looks as good on mobile devices as it does on desktop;

Disadvantages:

In order to create such post, you need an account of rank Jr. Member or higher

You need to have people on your team or on freelance that can create a product of high visual quality

It is harder to create beautiful hybrid post than it is to create simple graphical one, because you’ll have to work with popular fonts, default line heights that cannot be altered, BitcoinTalk background color, etc.

In order for translators and community managers to be able to create their own localized versions of your ANN or bounty posts, they require up-to-date, properly sliced versions of Photoshop-files with your graphical content openly available to them.

Nuances

Time

Most of the people who’ll participate in your translation bounty campaign are professional bounty hunters, whose goal is to deliver their work as fast as possible and receive their promised steaks (bounty campaign points). They don’t care much about the visual quality of their work if it slows them down. For example, you’ve launched your graphical ANN and bounty posts on the first day of the month but were able to prepare properly sliced Photoshop files with graphical content only on the second day. Most of the bounty hunters, in this case, would already have started translating your posts on day one. Because they didn’t have the Photoshop source files available to them on day one, they would work with what is – raster images from your posts. They will be able to change the texts in your images, but the quality of such alterations will be questionable, resulting in localized posts looking worse than original ones. These situations can be solved later on, but it requires time, which is of essence during the ICO campaign and that’s why it is utterly important to have all your properly sliced Photoshop files ready on day one.

Simplicity

Most of the bounty hunters are familiar with image editors and have them installed on their machines. Mostly the ones from Adobe, but often the versions of programs they use are very outdated (Adobe Photoshop CS2-3, Adobe Fireworks CS5-6), that’s why when preparing the sliced Photoshop files, we suggest you merge as many layers as possible, leaving only the text editable. We also suggest not to use new Adobe CC features such as double or triple gradient layer effects, artboards, etc. The simpler your file is, the more predictable result you get from a bounty hunter.

Email template

It’s not a commonly known fact, but it is possible to place a whole email template, with recipient address, subject, and body text set in advance in a regular “mailto:” link. It is very convenient for a person who decided to write you an email – it will save him a lot of time if he encounters such link. Here’s an example that offers a visitor to become project’s advisor. These type of links also work In terms of BitcoinTalk, but you have to place them using [email][/email] tag, not the [url][/url]. You can also wrap images in [email] tags the same way you do it with [url].

Limit for symbols

Posts on BitcoinTalk cannot be infinitely long, they have a character limit set, but if you encounter it, forum will just show you an error about you having an improperly closed tag somewhere in your post, i.e., will misinform you. Officially the characters limit for one post is 64,000 symbols, but in some cases this limit fired at 63,000+ characters, while others reported they were able to publish posts with 65,535 and 68,575 characters in length respectively. Besides that, this restriction is a floating one. It varies from one forum section to another. In Tokens (altcoins) and Bounties (altcoins) it is approximately the same as mentioned above, but in Russian localized section, for example, the allowed character amount was two times smaller.

You’ll probably won’t encounter this limit while publishing your ANN post, but it will come in handy when doing a bounty post.

Conclusions

Based on the experience of launching our own ANN and bounty posts and making a lot of changes to them, the conclusion would be that it’s better to do hybrid ANN posts, because:

They can sell (even if they do it a bit worse than purely graphical posts) and can look good on both desktop and mobile devices

They are a lot cheaper in maintenance

They are easy to work with for bounty campaign participants

They take less time to prepare because there are fewer images to create, and these pictures are usually more simple than in graphical posts

Hybrid ANN posts usually host less pictures than image ones, and these pictures are usually smaller in dimensions, making them better targets for lossless image optimisation, which all in all may result in better loading times.

It is better not to use image-links for ANN posts in different languages, but rather to make them text ones, otherwise it could create a lot of additional work for the creator as well as for the bounty campaign participants.

It looks beautiful, but because there are around 16-20 main languages that your ANN post will be translated to, you and your bounty hunters will have to create these 16-20 images for each language, resulting in around 256-400 images. It’s just not worth it.

Publication of ANN post

Before you publish your ANN post, there are several things you should know.

Name of your post

Each day dozens of new ANN posts appear on BitcoinTalk and dozens of “old” ones ascend to top positions of the section because of the active discussions happening in them. Tokens (altcoins) section is somewhat similar to very dynamic Featured section of some kind of popular App Store – all market participants want to get their place under the sun, because it provides visibility to the project, which in return gives free traffic.

It would be discussed later - how to get to the top of the section, but right now we will speak about how to get noticed when you’re already on the top. All headings in the section are made of text and mostly all of them have blocks in brackets, such as [ANN][ICO]. In order to better distinguish your post you can use ASCII symbols and emojis – you won’t get banned for this:

Using these symbols, you can better draw attention to your post and easier onboard new visitors to your topic.

For example, instead of using normal square brackets [EXAMPLE], you can use these symbols【EXAMPLE】that by default have thicker lines to them and are better drawing attention. If to wrap this example in emoji, then your heading will distinct even better, for instance ?【EXAMPLE】?.

That’s it, but it is important not to overdo it.

The most often encountered emojis on BitcoinTalk are:

? ⚡??✅?⭐

Reply reservation

Tokens (altcoins) section is always monitored by bounty hunters, especially by translators. As soon as they see new post appear, they jump into it and instantaneously leave a reply message with text stating something similar to “I reserve the Indonesian translation.” This is all good and well, despite the fact that it’s better to be able to reserve the first reply message for yourself – you can use it for thread updates or at least have an opportunity to divide your main post in two if it gets too big.

After the publication of your ANN post, the tab you’ve published it in usually loads slower than the entry appears in the altcoins section, so in order to reserve the first reply for yourself, you need to do:

Open two separate tabs in your browser, each on Tokens (altcoins); Have the “Reserved” text copied to your clipboard Use one tab to publish your ANN post As soon as you’ve pressed the “Post” button, switch to the second tab and continuously hit “Refresh” button until you see your post Jump into the post and immediately hit the “Reply” button, paste the “Reserved” text in and then hit the “Post” button.

If you’ve done everything fast enough, first post reply will be yours and you will be able to use it as intended (by editing its content). In case you weren’t able to make it (bounty hunters are very fast after all), you’ll have to use your main post’s footer to publish the updates.

In order to reduce the risk of losing your first reply message to bounty hunters, we advise to publish your ANN post when there are less people on the forum. BitcoinTalk is an international platform, meaning that there are always users online, but we definitely recommend avoiding publishing your post from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EST.

What to do right after your post has been published

There are many things you can do right after publishing your ANN post, depending on how well did you prepare for the guerilla community management, but there’s a minimum program you should do.

If you’ve made a high-quality attractive ANN post, you will start receiving your first comments about participation in bounty program, language translation reservations and general questions about your project within the first minutes. It is very important to respond to those comments promptly and in full while staying polite and positive. Keeping your FAQ close to increase your answer speed is generally a good idea. If you manage to respond to people’s questions while offering them a way to continue a conversation with you, you will get into victorious situation. Every time someone leaves a comment in your post, it jumps up to the top of Tokens (altcoins) section. There it receives visibility, that’s why the more discussion is happening in your post, the more popular it gets. You have to remember that BitcoinTalk moderators are working for a salary, not for free, so they do their job well – all off-topic posts and pointless comments are quickly deleted.

Even participating in topic discussions, you need to keep an eye on personal messages – a place where you’ll receive offers of paid help from different forum dwellers. Some of the offered services may be of use to you, but in any case, you should always be wary and check the reputation of users who are offering them.

During the first few hours after the publication of your ANN-post, we suggest you keep at least two people watching the thread and answering user comments and questions.

When launching local ANN posts in different languages, prepare that some people may be very salty and even poisonous. You still need to behave politely with them.

At the end of the 12th century, unexpectedly, Genghis Khan created the world’s largest empire, gaining control over the trade route “the Silk Road” which stretched across China to Eastern Europe. Secured under Mongolian leadership, during the Pax Mongolica period, the Silk Road was particularly safe from raiders as well as taxes, which stimulated free trade between China and the Mediterranean countries enabling political, economic stability to follow.

Pax Crypto

Recently the Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a cyber-initiative grander in scale than Pax Mongolica after consulting with Ethereum co-founder Blockchain expert Vitalik Buterin and experts from fifteen other countries- including the US, India, Israel, Armenia and Turkey- about their Blockchain and cryptocurrency initiatives. Putin’s first of it’s kind cyber-initiative will connect some of the most promising emerging market economies stretching across Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and South America, via Blockchain and smart contract technology by using a new multinational cryptocurrency to be collectively adopted by the BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) countries (Member States).

Member States, known for their tremendous economic growth potential, could hail this first of its kind cyber-initiative. As they have been reeling from the global credit crisis of 2007/2008, which hindered their economies. Federal rate increases augmented their mounting debt burdens and falling global commodity prices stymied their export led growth. The cyber-initiative could reshape Member State economies, by spurring technological innovation for income growth and economic prosperity.

Russia’s proposal- first multinational cryptocurrency for BRICS and EEU

As reported by Russian media source RT, days before the end of 2017, the Central Bank of Russia, proposed to create the first joint multinational cryptocurrency for BRICS and EEU countries. By jointly adopting a new cryptocurrency, the Member States could increase their investments in Blockchain, smart contract technology pushing towards creating cashless societies and improve managing their liquidities with substantial support from the New Development Bank.

Many economists, veteran bankers and traditional financial institutions have sought to downplay the influence of cryptocurrencies in the overall world economy, such as the German insurance giant Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian who said: ‘‘Bitcoin’s price will explode, but mass adoption is not going to happen.”

But if adopted and implemented, the first multinational cryptocurrency could be used by more than 41 percent of the world’s population. It could potentially improve trade efficiency among the Member States by replacing other fiat currencies used in trade settlements. And it could create a technologically resourceful trade block that could reshape global trade via Blockchain and smart contract technology.

However, for this initiative to succeed, among other things, Member State transnational legislation concerning cryptocurrencies would need to be updated in a synchronized fashion. As currently there are substantial differences between Member State legislation concerning cryptocurrencies as summarized in the table below.

Russia’s new cryptocurrency bill

Based on instructions from President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s central bank and finance ministry jointly prepared a bill for the regulation of сryptocurrencies and ICOs which was submitted to the Duma for approval on Dec. 28, 2017. The bill is expected to be adopted in March and finalized by July 1, 2018.

Characterization of cryptocurrencies

The bill characterizes cryptocurrency, including ICO tokens not as legal tender but as “other property.”

ICO Regulation

The bill allows for ICOs but establishes restrictions on them. Those who are not qualified investors will be able to purchase tokens of a certain type for an amount not exceeding 50 thousand Rubles ($869). The ministry also suggests limiting the maximum amount of funds raised by an ICO to one bln Rubles ($17.4 mln). Although the President of the Russian Association of cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RABIC), Yuri Pripachkin, argued: “ICO fundraising should not be limited as they can attract an unlimited amount of foreign investments to Russian projects.”

Taxation of cryptocurrency mining and trading

Presently mining and trading of cryptocurrencies is not regulated under Russian laws. The bill defines cryptocurrency mining and trading as a taxable activity. Individual entrepreneurs and legal entities could engage in cryptocurrency mining and trading activities, subject to tax by analogy with the taxation of business activities.

Cryptocurrency trading would not be subject to a value-added tax (VAT).

Cross-border tax policy of Member States concerning the new Multinational cryptocurrency

The bill does not address cross-border tax rules that could apply to transnational cryptocurrency transactions among Member States in the event the new multinational cryptocurrency is adopted.

Member States, with the exception of Armenia, Belarus, Iran and Kyrgyzstan adhere to OECD BEPS action plan. It is not clear whether Member States will follow an approach similar to the EU in formulating an appropriate transnational tax policy for their new multinational сryptocurrency transactions.

CoinDaddy is a former real estate agent who now raps about the so-called crypto life.

Many of the characters live in the Crypto Castle, visited by Business Insider last year.



Who's the player got the women liiiike...Coindaddy

Who's the player got the blockchain tiiiiie...Coindaddy

Those are the opening lyrics to one of the latest tracks by the rapper CoinDaddy, née Arya Bahmanyar.

A former real estate agent who decided to combine his passion for cryptocurrency with his musical aspirations, Coindaddy is one of the motley crew of individuals in San Francisco's burgeoning, bizarre crypto culture chronicled in a fascinating article by the New York Times' Nellie Bowles.

Among the others in this surreal cast of characters is a mixed martial arts fighter that discovered cryptocurrencies through his passion for ""vintage pornography,"" and a 26-year-old who cradles a cat named Mr. Bigglesworth and claims to be sitting on a crypto fortune worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

With the price of bitcoin now roughly $14,000, and the blockchain technology that underlies bitcoin now in full hype mode, the world is experiencing a case of cryptocurrency fever that could either reshape global economies or crash and burn spectacularly. But while many investors and companies are dipping their toes in the water to see what bitcoin and other blockchain technology is all about, a tribe of true-believers in San Francisco is living and breathing crypto.

Many of these crypto die-hards live or frequent a three-story home known as the Crypto Castle, which was profiled by Business Insider in January 2017. There's also a nearby (and presumably less regal) Crypto Crackhouse, where other members of the clan live, toil and share communal bathrooms.

Members speak in their own patois, with neologisms like ""HODL,"" a play on the word ""hold"" that's apparently meant to convey a person's commitment to cryptocurrencies. And there's even a clothing company called hodlmoon that sells customized sweaters with bitcoin themes, so devotees can dress the part.

This week News.Bitcoin.com carried the breaking story alleging employees of giant Northern European bank Nordea were being forbidden by company policy from owning or trading cryptocurrency. Since publication, a bank employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, forwarded evidence the large institution is indeed going ahead with such plans.

Also read: Swedish Bank Allegedly Forbids Employees from Owning Cryptocurrency

Nordea Bank Whistleblower

Word spread 12 January 2018 on Twitter Nordea Bank “forbids all their employees (at least in Sweden) to stop owning and trading $btc and other crypto currency. This applies to secretaries, IT personal [sic], cleaners and any bank staff employed by the company. Is it legal even?,” asked Twitter user @samisin.

Nordea Bank AB has more than half a trillion dollars in assets, and is one of the largest banks in Northern Europe. Its alleged move against employees’ cryptocurrencies were not all that surprising when placed in the backdrop of the bank’s executive team’s disparaging public comments. Executives have long worried about cryptocurrency and its lack of regulation, and more recently complained about the fact bitcoin was allowed to exist without jumping through all the hoops of the traditional banking system, referring to the phenomenon as “a joke.”

Bitcoin’s value, however, is exactly that: it could not have existed if brought through the regular cartel channel of state-backed banks such as Nordea. Its precise reason for being is to defy minders and bureaucratic middle persons, landing in the hands of ordinary, uncredentialed and unlicensed peoples.

After News.Bitcoin.com published the story, a whistleblower came forward with documentation on the assurance of anonymity.

According to memorandums obtained by News.Bitcoin.com, a decision by Nordea’s board was made 13 December 2017. The message’s import was to affirm no employees of the bank were allowed to trade bitcoin nor other cryptocurrencies. When queried about what to do with crypto already held by employees, an answer was not immediately forthcoming.

Trade Union Might Take Up Cause

The memos were pulled from Yammer, a social networking site used by some businesses for private communication. Its network is open by invite only.

A second communication from the bank further outlined coming policy: The ban will be effective late February due to “its highly speculative nature, including high investment/volatility risk, and the related tax evasion and money laundering risks,” the source details. New rules also include how unless “otherwise stated, the rules set forth in this section apply to all transactions. Therefore, it is irrelevant whether they are carried out on [a personal] account, on behalf of a Closely Related Person, a customer, the Group, or on behalf of another party within or outside the scope of work,” the memo reads.

Furthermore, “No Employee, Service Provider or Tied Agent at the Group may: Conduct trading in Bitcoins and other Cryptocurrencies.” Exemptions are being provided for if investments “in financial instruments manufactured by Nordea linked to cryptocurrencies. Further, the prohibition does not cover minor investments in cryptocurrency made by employees in product development roles who have a work-related reason to do so, and where the respective Head of the BA/GF has pre-approved the investment following consultation with Group Compliance,” the bank explained. There appears to also be “special circumstances” clause as well.

When the anonymous source was asked about employees’ feelings on the matter, “Regarding the workers, as far as I know many care and think this policy is way to far reaching when it comes to their right to own whatever legal property they wish, and therefore complaints have also been made to the union Finansförbundet,” we were told.

As a result of “complaints by employees,” the 33,000 member trade union Financial Sector Union of Sweden, Finansförbundet, representing bank employees, is reportedly set to discuss a formal response during an internal meeting this Tuesday, 16 January 2018.

Anyone can create a cryptocurrency. It’s a surprisingly simple process, especially if you copy the codebase of an existing coin and give it a new name. That’s how many of the most popular cryptocurrencies such as litecoin were born. But creating a cryptocurrency and mining the genesis block isn’t enough: until that coin has its own mobile wallet and can be used to transact, it doesn’t deserve to be called a cryptocurrency.

Real Cryptos Reside on Your Cellphone

The internet was born on desktop devices but it now resides in our pockets – or more often our palms, since we rarely stop using our mobile devices long enough these days to put them away. When Satoshi published his white paper in October 2008, desktop was still the preferred means of doing business on the web, but all that was about to change. 14 months earlier, Steve Jobs had unveiled the iPhone, ushering in the stirrings of what would become the mobile revolution.

Meanwhile, Satoshi was quietly getting on with his own cryptocurrency revolution. By late 2010, Satoshi had checked out, but the seed he had sown was sprouting into a digital money tree that was growing fast. By 2016, mobile web usage outstripped desktop usage, and the crypto economy, which had stagnated for the last two years, exploded into life. Suddenly everyone was releasing coins and tokens, many of which were mobile-oriented, and everyone was tweeting, Snapchatting and vlogging about crypto.

There was just one problem: most of these new cryptocurrencies weren’t actually spendable. They were more like future currencies, that would be usable in around 18 months’ time when the development team got round to releasing Android and iOS wallets. Bitcoin might be expensive to send and ripple might be pointless to send, but at least they can be used as a form of currency, P2P or P2B. Good luck transforming the lives of the unbanked with your “cheap and fast” transactions that can only be sent from desktop wallet to desktop wallet.

iOS Ain’t Easy

The difficulty many developers face is that having an app approved for the App Store is an arduous and rigorous process. Apple don’t accept any old code, cobbled together and rushed to market, which is how many cryptocurrency projects seem to operate. As a consequence, mobile wallets – iOS especially – have proven to be a sticking point. Of the coins currently in the cryptocurrency top 10, half don’t have their own dedicated wallet.

Ripple, cardano, stellar, IOTA, and EOS all lack proprietary iOS wallets, with ripple and stellar at least spendable using third party wallets. Venture outside the top 10 and very few coins have a mobile wallet; monero for example is still waiting on full iOS support. Mobile wallets take time and tinkering to perfect, so it’s not the fault of development teams that they’re unable to push these apps out overnight. But until they do, all their talk of being able to support thousands of transactions a second and enable peer to peer exchange is just that – talk.

Do you agree that cryptocurrencies without mobile support aren’t proper currencies? Let us know in the comments section below.

Bitcoin Games is a provably fair gaming site with 99% or better expected returns. Try it out here.",2018-01-15 04:30:31+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/no-dont-buy-whole-bitcoin,"“How much is bitcoin?”

“Around $14,000.”

“Well, that’s too expensive. I can’t afford that.”

It’s a conversation that has surely happened thousands of times over the past several months as a new swarm of people find themselves enchanted by the cryptocurrency space and its tremendous gains.

And it reveals not only a misunderstanding, but also a psychological barrier that many face stepping into the scene for their first time.

Since so much emphasis is placed on how much “one” bitcoin is worth across the industry, new users often come in thinking that if they want to participate, they’ll have to fork over tens of thousands of dollars to buy a whole bitcoin.

But actually, that isn’t the case – it’s possible to buy a half of a bitcoin, a quarter of a bitcoin or even a fraction of a percent of a bitcoin.

Yet, that’s not always clear to new people entering the market, and many believe that’s why a handful of altcoins – including dogecoin and dentacoin, both of which recently reached market caps of more than $1 billion – are seeing a pump in their price, as they offer an affordable way to get into the cryptocurrency markets in whole units.

And this confusion is (partly) why developer Jimmy Song argues some standardization should occur in what the industry calls smaller units of bitcoin.

Toward this goal, Song released a standards proposal that seeks to express one one-millionth of a bitcoin (about one cent at today’s prices) as a “bit.” And he’s nudging wallet providers, exchanges and other bitcoin businesses to support the proposal.

If widely adopted, he hopes it will put an end to this confusion, and make new crypto users more apt to purchase bitcoin, if even in tiny amounts, instead of cryptocurrencies that he thinks might come back to bite them, since many of the cheap altcoins don’t have much technical merit to back them up.

Rise of the ‘bits’

The problem now is that more traditional dollar units, such as $5, when converted to bitcoin look daunting and messy – at 0.000345 bitcoin.

But with Song’s proposal – which he’s released in the form of a bitcoin improvement proposal, or BIP – that dollar value would instead be 345 bits, still a mental juggle, but arguably less confusing, since it’s in whole numbers and not decimals.

“For whatever psychological reason, normal people have trouble understanding decimals and fractions. $0.002 is weirder than $200.00,” said Erik Voorhees, co-founder and CEO of ShapeShift, which supports Song’s proposal, adding:

“For bitcoin to be a global, commonly used currency, it would certainly be helpful to have a denomination that allows people to express prices in integers (2,000 bits for a coffee) rather than a decimal.”

Adding to the mental benefits, Song also said the standardizing “bit” would remove what he calls “unit bias.”

According to Song, people don’t like having what looks like such a small amount of bitcoin, or money in general for that matter. Bitcoin’s price rise at the end of 2017, only exacerbated that problem, adding even more zeros in between the positive numbers and the decimal.

Poking fun at all the recent bitcoin forks, Song said, a group of people could have success enticing a new wave of crypto buyers by splitting off bitcoin with the goal of moving bitcoin’s decimal system six positions.

While others have proposed similar unit changes in the past, Song’s proposal seems to be gaining transaction with exchanges and other companies, which is all the proposal needs to succeed – getting businesses to use the unit to display not only how much bitcoin is in an individual’s wallet but also, within merchants stores, how much things cost.

And even though, Song’s proposal is targeted at bitcoin, it could serve as an outline for how other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, could update their units to be more user-friendly.

Still confused?

Although the idea of the proposal is to limit confusion, it’s garnered its fair share of criticism, with those against claiming it could add to the confusion instead.

The critics say, for instance, that if not all companies roll out the standard at the same time – and ShapeShift uses “bits,” while Coinbase sticks with “bitcoin” – when sending bitcoin from one wallet to another, they could either think they somehow earned money or lost money.

Voorhees, for one, even agreed this was a concern, but argued that it shouldn’t stop bitcoin companies from eventually adopting the standard.

“There will undoubtedly be some mistakes and friction as the new term gains usage, but for the purpose of language and mathematical simplification, the net result should be beneficial to bitcoin’s adoption,” he said.

Meanwhile, Song stressed that even though he thinks it would be a move in the right direction, like most things in the cryptocurrency world, it’s up to the community to decide if they want to adopt the system or not.

Still, many more exchanges and businesses would need to adopt the change to get the ball rolling. Song has been tweeting at various exchanges and companies – including CoinMarketCap, one of the most popular sites for checking cryptocurrency prices – suggesting they move to “bits.”

Song concluded:

“This is meant to be a community-driven initiative and the benefits will hopefully be obvious to businesses.”

Below, we’ll look at some of the most impressive success stories of the year, as well as the profiles of people who probably wish they’d never touched Bitcoin at all.

It’s a highly erratic currency, but people who invested in it before its recent prominence often found their foresight was lucrative in ways they never imagined at first.

This Anonymous Person Who Became a Bitcoin Millionaire

One anonymous person who posted a detailed story on Steemit said that in 2010, the price of each Bitcoin was so low that it was not even valuable enough to buy a pizza. Still, by the end of that year, the person reportedly had 12,000 Bitcoins and collecting the large number of them paid off.

That’s because by April 2013, the worth of each Bitcoin had ballooned to over $100. Due to some issues in the individual’s personal life and a few other non-Bitcoin-related factors, the person took a couple of breaks from Bitcoin but was never completely out of the loop with them. Eventually, this anonymous Bitcoin user heard that the 12,000 Bitcoins were now worth over $10 mln.

Despite that fortunate turn of events, the person only began selling them in small quantities so as to not attract attention. The individual also planned for the future by choosing investment strategies and did not let the rapid wealth impact their employment. As words of advice, the person suggests exercising patience and not getting greedy, while also keeping up on newsworthy events.

Erik Fineman

Erik Fineman began investing in Bitcoins in 2011 when he was only 11 after his grandmother gave him $1,000 and his brother offered him a tip about what to do with the money. In those early days, Bitcoins were only worth $12 each. However, when Fineman sold his first Bitcoins at the end of 2013, each one had a value of $1,200.

By then, Fineman had turned the $1,000 from his grandma into $100,000 and used it to start an online education company in 2014. He hadn’t had a pleasant experience in high school and thought that his new business venture could connect frustrated students and willing teachers over video chat. Fineman also moved to Silicon Valley, traveled the world and made a bet with his parents that if he were a millionaire by age 18, he’d not have to go to college.

In January 2015, Fineman sold his education company and was given the choice of accepting $100,000 or 300 Bitcoins. He took the Bitcoins. Fineman also achieved his goal of becoming an 18-year-old millionaire and won’t be going to college. He says he’s happy learning from real-world experiences. However, Fineman stays busy with numerous projects, including involvement with NASA. Those activities — and savvy business sense — feasibly helped him get where he is today.

Jeremy Gardner

Jeremy Gardner is another person who boldly began investing in Bitcoin during the early days — notice a pattern here? — and received a substantial payoff. In 2013, one of Gardner’s friends got him some Bitcoins in exchange for cash and Gardener began feeling fascinated about how he could work with the currency with nothing more than an Internet connection. He also loved how there was no centralized regulatory body for Bitcoin.

As Gardener became immersed in the Bitcoin world, he became a strong and emphatic voice in the cryptocurrency world, often using social media as a platform. He also wisely invested money into starting and supporting companies associated with Bitcoins and Blockchain technology.

Gardner stops short of disclosing how much money he’s made by investing in Bitcoin technologies, but is referred to as a “self-made millionaire.” Plus, he keeps a realistic perspective and understands that whenever the value of Bitcoins goes up rapidly, it’ll likely also go in the other direction soon. However, Gardener has a broad network of investments. Those interests are arguably helping protect his worth and allow him to get financial benefits from numerous sources.

Mr. Smith (not his real name)

Traveling the world is something many people dream of doing, but Mr. Smith has turned that aspiration into reality, all due to Bitcoin investments starting in 2010. A man with a college education and former Silicon Valley employee, Mr. Smith, heard about Bitcoins in July of 2010 and began investing in them a few months later.

Knowing he was in it for the long haul, Smith put his Bitcoin investments on the backburner until 2013, a time when the cryptocurrency’s value started rising rapidly. Eventually, the price per coin went up to more than 2,000 times what Smith originally paid for it. He now claims to have made $25 million from an initial $3,000 investment and uses the money to go on lavish, round-the-world travels that involve only staying in five-star hotels and flying first-class.

Smith still owns 1,000 Bitcoins, but only wants to sell those once the per-coin value reaches $150,000. He has no regrets about selling the rest and says he has everything he ever wanted, thanks to Bitcoins.

Tim Enneking

Tim Enneking is a prime example of how to succeed in Bitcoin investing. He’s a hedge fund manager who achieved the all-time annual records for both funds and funds of funds.

Enneking was skeptical of digital currencies, although he started running the world’s first digital currency fund. During his work, Enneking decided to rigorously research Bitcoins. After realizing he didn’t find any red flags, he concluded perhaps there was more to the cryptocurrency than he’d originally thought and started looking for ways to become more heavily involved in funds management.

Enneking now has experience overseeing funds within the US and abroad. He advocates being cautious while investing and taking time to understand market trends. Furthermore, Enneking reminds potential investors that due to the rapid fluctuations of digital currencies, it may take time to see investments become fruitful.

Olaf-Carlson Wee

You might not have heard of 26-year-old Olaf-Carlson Wee before, but he’s another person who recognized the potential of Bitcoins before many other people and got rich as a result. In February 2013, at a time when a single Bitcoin’s worth was between $20-30, Carson Wee began working for a Bitcoin startup called Coinbase.

At that time, Bitcoins were not part of the cultural consciousness yet, and the mere mention of them caused raised eyebrows if people were aware of them at all. However, Carlson Wee viewed Bitcoins as a promising currency. He made an arrangement with his employer to only get paid with them instead of physical money and started making transactions with Bitcoins whenever possible. Those decisions were ultimately profitable because they made Carlson Wee a millionaire.

The success stories you just read might be enough to make you want to start investing in Bitcoins immediately. But, if there’s a consistent thread in all those outstanding stories, it’s that the Bitcoin value changes without warning. However, some people have unfortunate circumstances related to Bitcoins that aren't always about their falling value. You’ll see some examples below.

James Howells

James Howells, a 32-year-old man from Wales, started working with Bitcoins from a computer in 2009. A year later, he disassembled the device and stored the parts in a drawer, then eventually threw them away.

Because several years’ worth of trash now lie on top of the valuable but discarded hard drive, retrieving it is an expensive process, and the condition of the hard drive is unknown. However, the reason why the ramifications of this failure became especially evident this year is that estimates suggest the hard drive and the Bitcoins it contains are worth more than $100 mln at today’s prices.

Howells keeps an upbeat attitude about his lost fortune and knows there’s no point in getting too upset about it. If he ever does recover it, however, he’ll buy a Lamborghini.

Despite how things turned out for Howells, he hasn’t given up on cryptocurrencies. He’s still active with them today and puts his energies into one called Bitcoin Cash.

Mark Frauenfelder

Most people have gone through the frustration of forgetting passwords and PINs, but they probably don’t have to deal with the aftermath of losing the equivalent of $30,000 because of the blunder. However, Mark Frauenfelder invested $3,000 in Bitcoins last year and had numerous profitable ventures afterward. He talked to Bitcoin experts who told him that using a hardware wallet was the best way to protect his Bitcoin cache, so Frauenfelder bought one in November 2016 for $100.

While setting up the hardware wallet, he had to set up a PIN, along with a 24-word list used to recover access if needed. Frauenfelder wrote down the words on a piece of paper. Unfortunately, a cleaning company employee threw the document away. Frauenfelder didn’t think that was a big deal at first until he discovered he’d forgotten his PIN.

Desperate to regain access, he went online and posted on forums, plus contacted customer service representatives associated with the hardware wallet manufacturer. Frauenfelder even visited a hypnotist this spring, but the session did not bring about successful results.

At long last, he got help from someone who helped him hack into the hardware wallet and get the PIN and 24-word list. But, not without substantial heartache, stress and paying money for retrieval methods.

This woman who used Bitcoin to hire a hitman

The anonymous nature of Bitcoin may compel people to use the currency for illegal things. However, as a 58-year-old Italian woman who lives in Denmark learned, doing that can cause trouble. She hired a hitman to carry out a failed murder plot related to her boyfriend and used Bitcoin to pay for it.

A court ruling resulted in a six-year jail term. It also caused her to lose residence privileges in Denmark, where she’s lived for 30 years.

Cody Brown

Cody Brown, a startup executive, saw first hand how bad things could get during a Bitcoin theft. He lost $8,000 worth of Bitcoins in 15 minutes after a hacker got into his Verizon account, which was connected with Coinbase. Brown believed he got targeted because of a tweet he’d RT’d from a friend who’d also been hacked earlier. Brown is not hopeful of ever getting the stolen cryptocurrency back.

However, he’s also not giving up on Bitcoins. Brown believes that the companies involved in it will eventually figure out how to lock their systems down tighter and potentially add more fraud protection resources for customers.

Simon

Simon first used the TOR network in 2011. He stumbled upon one of those shady online marketplaces that offered all kinds of illegal things, — guns, drugs, counterfeit documents, you name it.

As a teenager, Simon decided that getting a brand new passport for a certain European country would be a neat thing to do. The price tag was 10,000 BTC. If he threw in an extra 6,000 BTC, the seller promised to get Simon a press ID from an esteemed newspaper, too. He couldn’t resist.

Simon transferred his funds to a crypto-exchange platform but, when it came time for the merchant to deliver, the merchant disappeared. ‘Maybe he got arrested?’ Simon wondered to himself. He was confused, but he still had his money safely tucked away in the exchange account since the seller had vanished. All was okay as far as he was concerned.

Two years later, newspapers began reporting the arrest of a Russian man accused of money laundering. The name of the laundering service he had controlled was Liberty Finance, which Simon instantly recognized as the crypto-exchange platform he had used to keep his 20,000 BTC.

In light of the scandal, the FBI seized control of the exchange platform and all money associated with it. Simon kissed that money goodbye long ago, but it doesn’t make it easier for him to see how Bitcoin has appreciated over time.

If Liberty Finance hadn’t been a money laundering scam, Simon would have acquired some $400 mln dollars.

BTC-e

Despite the lack of regulation in the Bitcoin world, entities that are breaking the law still get caught. Case in point? BTC-e, a long-running Bitcoin exchange.

It received a $110 mln fine from the Federal Trade Commission for alleged money laundering. Also, Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man associated with the exchange got arrested and faces over five decades in prison if convicted.

Anatoly Kaplan

Another recent incidence of alleged questionable behavior from Russia comes from Anatoly Kaplan, the owner of ForkLog, a Russian cryptocurrency news outlet. According to reports, the Ukrainian Secret Service is investigating Kaplan in connection with alleged associations with Americans involved in unlawful activities.

The Ukrainian authorities searched Kaplan’s apartment and confiscated his laptop. Also, this is not the first time ForkLog has come to the attention of law enforcement officials. Kaplan maintains his innocence and asserts his site does not have technology capable of the things the Ukrainian police accuse him of doing.

Kaplan also says during the search and seizure related to the investigation, one of the Ukrainians tried to transfer some of Kaplan’s Bitcoins. Kaplan and his attorney plan to take legal action and are confident about a positive outcome, but even so, this event has already caused stress and unfavorable publicity for Kaplan and his ForkLog site.

These tales of wonder and woe prove that Bitcoin investments are not for the faint of heart.

The people who engage in them must be ready for ruin, but they might become amazingly prosperous instead.",,https://mix247edm.com/what-are-crypto-raves/,"I’m sure many of you have heard of cryptocurrencies by now. If not, I’m sure you’ve at least heard of the “granddaddy” of crypto–Bitcoin.

In short, cryptocurrencies are decentralized currencies that have no middle man by making all transactions accessible to everyone through technology called a blockchain. In simpler terms, people don’t want the banks controlling their money, so digital currencies are spreading like wildfire so that people can trade on this technology and not have to deal with a centralized being controlling their money. The transactions are executed once other users recognize them as legitimate and approve the trade.

You may be thinking: What does this have to do with raves?

Well, just like their money, people also want other things decentralized, such as underground raves–now being referred to as crypto raves. The underground rave scene was wildly popular back in the day when social media had yet to blossom and the only way to find these raves was by word of mouth. They were exclusive and extremely exciting.

Now the internet is flooded with rumors that there may be an underground rave revival underway. However, instead of having to know the right people, now anyone on these public blockchains can hear about these parties and be given a personal key to invite others, if deemed trustworthy. Wired wrote a detailed piece on this subject and even interviewed someone who already attended one of these raves, artist Mat Dryhurst.

“Like most good things, it emerged slowly and organically,” said Dryhurst, “The first time I went to a crypto rave, I got a text message from a friend who was given a few invites, received my own unique keys and was given an invite of my own to share.”

As the article explains, these “keys” aren’t as simple as a password you say at the door. They come in several forms: PGP-signed messgaes on public blockchains or tokens, much like tickets, that are distributed by Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

Just as people need to approve transactions on the blockchain for Bitcoin or other coin trades to successfully transfer, a guest for one of these raves must have a number of approved ‘block confirmations’ to ensure their access. These are usually given by the party organizers. So although you don’t need to necessarily know everyone who is attending, it is still an exclusive game.

These public blockchains on which these tokens are dispersed are anonymous and organized by people who only approve users they can trust to not overspread the word. They can also reach outside the realm of EDM, but most that have taken place so far are centered around the techno scene. These are rumored to be hot around the San Francisco Bay Area, Moscow, and Berlin.

“This could be groundbreaking for music as a medium. Rather than being limited to implying ideology through stylistic gestures and poetry, we are now able to execute ideology,” said Dryhurst.

We will continue to follow this technology and provide you with updates as it spreads to other forms of art and entertainment.

In the memo outlining details of discussions at a meeting of internet regulators and other policymakers last week, PBOC Vice Governor Pan Gongsheng said the government would continue to apply pressure to the virtual currency trade and prevent the build up of risks in that market.

National and local authorities should ban venues that provide centralized trading of virtual currencies, of which bitcoin is the biggest, Pan said. They also need to ban individuals or institutions that provide market-making activities, guarantees, or settlement services for centralized trading of the currencies, such as online “wallet” service providers.

Chinese regulators last year banned initial coin offerings, shut down local cryptocurrency trading exchanges and limited bitcoin mining - but activity in the cryptocurrency and bitcoin space has continued through alternative channels in China despite the crackdown.

“The financial work conference clearly called for limiting ‘innovations’ that deviate from the need of the real economy and escape regulation,” Pan said, according to the memo, referring to last week’s meeting.

Authorities should also block domestic and foreign websites and close mobile apps that provide centralized virtual currency trading services to Chinese users, and sanction platforms that provide virtual currency payment services, Pan said. He also called for local authorities to investigate services that help people move funds overseas.

Bloomberg reported on Monday that Chinese authorities plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralized trading.

China has grown into one of the world’s biggest sources of cryptocurrency mining, but Pan said authorities should work to end the practice.

He proposed local governments use regulations around electricity prices, land use, tax and environmental protection to guide businesses involved in such activities “toward an orderly exit”.

“Pseudo-financial innovations that have no relationship with the real economy should not be supported,” he said.

2017 was a breakthrough year for the crypto market for major coins such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, increasing awareness by the mainstream market, and innovative new applications of Blockchain technology drove impressive returns. More importantly, this blistering pace for the entire ecosystem is being driven by increasing appetite on the side of investors, with no sign of abating.

The breakneck speed at which the crypto market has expanded over the past year has not been without its hiccups and a fair share of skeptics. For many veterans, the current craze for cryptocurrencies resembles the madness of the late 90s and the heyday of the Dot-com bubble.

Trading volatility over the past few months hasn’t helped the rising voices of speculation. That Bitcoin crashed by nearly half its value in a single day, or that this isn’t the only similar incident, prove that massive price swings are still a major concern, and the market is incredibly unstable. Others, however, counter that even if the industry were to face a bubble, it could lead to a more mature and innovative market.

David Stockman, Ronald Reagan’s former director of the Office of Management:

""It's basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash. All of these latter-day speculators will have their hands burned to a crisp, and they will learn the proper lesson.""

As pretenders are weeded out, observers argue that the sector will stabilize, and continue expanding at a more measured pace.

Jeffrey Kleintop, chief strategist of Charles Schwab:

“...I think the Bitcoin bubble if you want to call it that, is something different. If Bitcoin prices were to plunge suddenly, because it's so independent from the financial system, it's kind of its own thing. It hasn't yet become embedded in the economy and the financial structure.”

Even so, the debate is not entirely black-and-white. The crypto ecosystem has shown signs of being in a bubble—disproportionate valuations for companies without actual products, an alarming rate of new ICOs, increasing numbers of scams and failed launches—but has also shown signs of a more stable future.

Marianne Lake, chief financial officer at JPMorgan:

“We are very open-minded to the potential use cases in future for digital currencies that are properly controlled and regulated.”

Major coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are slowly entering the financial mainstream as traditional exchanges increasingly offer related instruments, and merchants begin to accept more cryptocurrencies as payments. Nevertheless, the question remains a valid one—is the crypto market simply booming or is it finally growing up?

Riding out the boom

There are several indications that the crypto ecosystem could be in the midst of a massive bubble. The situation has repeatedly been compared to the Dot-com bubble, and in some cases, the similarities are plain to see. Driven by the excitement of a new, potentially revolutionary technology, investors ponied up millions in funding to companies that promised the sky but largely failed to deliver anything.

The Dot-com bubble [Image: Business Insider]

The 90s were about the rise of the Internet, and the current market is based around Blockchain, the architecture underlying most cryptocurrencies. The market capitalization for cryptocurrencies continues to hover closer to the $1 tln mark, despite wild swings that have pushed it between $700 and $800 bln over the past few months.

Image: Coinmarketcap

Moreover, the current boom in crypto valuations has been driven in large part by a completely unregulated ecosystem. It seems to reward the flashiest assets, even when their practical applications may be dubious at best. This is clear in the outsized capital many Blockchain-based companies have raised. In the second quarter of 2017 alone, ICOs raised nearly $800 mln in funding, with the first six months yielding $1.3 bln in capital.

Individually, the largest cryptocurrencies have all reached valuations that were not even contemplated just one year ago. Bitcoin, the first and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has soared over 1,700 percent in the last 12 months, skyrocketing from slightly over $800 to nearly hit $20,000 before settling lower.

Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ethereum have all seen similar trajectories in 2017, and indications point to continued growth. The signs of a bubble are there, and this current boom seems unsustainable. However, the reality may prove slightly different, for a variety of reasons. Recent volatility across the board, led by a crash in Ripple’s valuation following South Korea’s alleged announcement for a cryptocurrency trading ban, shows that the industry is susceptible to massive swings.

Even so, dips have historically been followed by upward corrections over recent months, showing the market’s staying power.

A more mature crypto market

Even as cries of a bubble get louder, the crypto market has actually trended in the direction of maturation. For one, governments are starting to recognize cryptocurrencies potential and embrace them in some ways. Japan recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method in 2017 as well as certifying several cryptocurrency exchanges to operate within its borders. Russia announced plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the CryptoRuble, and even Venezuela has revealed plans to launch its own coin.

Others have started to regulate the crypto market, offering hope that increased stability will lead to greater adoption. The EU and several Asian countries have enacted new laws to bring some order to the market. Even in the US, major exchanges have started offering Bitcoin futures as tools for more institutional investment participation.

Dennis Gartman, economist and commodity analyst, The Gartman Letter editor:

""It [cryptocurrency] is gaining some sense of legitimacy by the Cboe. ...When they [cryptocurrencies holders] begin to pay taxes on it, when it ceases to be an avenue for avoiding taxes, when it ceases to be a place where drug dealers are trading and making transactions, then I'll be interested.""

More importantly, however, businesses and entrepreneurs have embraced Blockchain, the market’s underlying technology, creating a thriving ecosystem of applications and services.

Companies are finding better ways to utilize Blockchain's capabilities, instead of relying on cryptocurrencies' speculative gains. Already, several companies have introduced solutions that improve on several traditional business activities, from creating better agreements—companies such as Jincor, which offers simple smart contract creation—to giving consumers better access to services like financing and cloud storage. Blockchain startups like Cryptopay are facilitating payments with cryptocurrencies, while others like SelfKey are focused on creating better forms of identification for individuals. Moreover, in the financial sphere, businesses like Legolas are improving wealth management and investment platforms.

These applications are quickly gaining popularity, and new companies are finding diverse ways to migrate their services to this architecture. However, many have natural barriers, as Blockchain requires a new round of development and hires.

Currently, most companies still rely on Ethereum’s ERC-20 protocol and smart contracts to build new applications, but that paradigm is still dev-heavy. Instead, some companies have already shown better pathways to developing Blockchain-based apps.

This nascent sector has already shown promise, and new applications are further expanding the ecosystem. Qtum, for example, provides a hybrid infrastructure for developers to build Blockchain applications that are suitable for operating with the major Blockchains, while also compatible with mobile and IoT services. The company’s dual architecture is based on Bitcoin Core and Ethereum Virtual Machine to allow for the use of smart contracts across platforms. The end-deliverable is a lighter-weight product with cross-chain functionality that outmatches Ethereum’s capabilities while broadening Blockchain’s appeal. The company has shown significant promise and caught investors’ attention, rewarding the valuation with a near 200 percent leap higher in December 2017.

Most importantly, however, cryptocurrencies are beginning to find real use cases. Ripple has been successful in carving a niche in banking and business-to-business transactions. Bitcoin Cash promises to solve many of Bitcoin’s shortcomings as a payment method, namely scaling and transaction speed. Meanwhile, Ethereum has proven its worth as an infrastructure for application development.

Even with the high volatility in the cryptocurrency market, the overarching trend in 2017 has been overwhelmingly positive. As the industry becomes more widely accepted, it could help significantly stabilize the recent wave of volatility.

2018 could be promising

There are signs that the crypto market is still rather unstable, including sky-high valuations and a rapid pace of growth that has rivaled manias of the past, but 2017 still closed on a strong note.

However, success in the next year will rely heavily on broader adoption. And a market that can withstand speculation waves. Should Bitcoin valuations remain highly volatile, investors and exchanges will eventually be scared off, and trading may decrease. The recent extreme swings experienced by the broader market highlights how precarious the current boom is.

Chart showing the Bitcoin price movement since 2013

2018 is promising to be a momentous year for the industry. As fears of a bubble collapse increase, many are looking at it optimistically. In their eyes, the ecosystem is ripe for a cleaning, and removing underperformers and unsustainable projects could enable the real contenders to grow. Moreover, a wave of consolidation and the entry of institutional investment into the sphere could lead to broader adoption and a more stable market.

Though the crypto market is growing, it must show sustainability and deliver better fungibility. As more companies demonstrate effective uses for cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology, the overall ecosystem should continue to stabilize and expand as awareness of its inherent benefits improves.

This means that 80 percent of all bitcoins that will be in existence have already been mined. According to estimates, bitcoin will reach its final coin figure sometime in 2140. (See also: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?)

Over the years, bitcoin has adjusted the number of coins in circulation through a complex calibration of miner rewards and problem difficulty. Bitcoins are awarded to miners who solve complex mathematical problems through intensive computation. The reward number is halved every 210,000 blocks, per bitcoin’s original algorithm.

Immediately after bitcoin’s launch, miners earned 50 coins as reward for solving problems. It was cut to 25 in 2012 and 12.5 in 2016. In two years, miners can expect 6.25 bitcoins as rewards. The difficulty of problems has kept pace with rewards. As the number of rewards has decreased, bitcoin’s problem difficulty has increased, thereby making it more difficult and computation intensive to earn the coin. (See also: 5 Best States For Bitcoin Mining And The Worst.)

What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?

Scarcity has an important role to play in bitcoin’s price. The latter entity is expected to skyrocket as demand and scarcity increase. In December 2017, Nicholas Gregory, CEO of CommerceBlock, a provider of tools for smart contract platforms, said that high transaction fees would keep bitcoin in business even after the final coin is mined.

Transaction fees on bitcoin’s network have surged after increased media attention and interest from investors resulted in skyrocketing prices for the cryptocurrency. According to blockchain.info, miners earned $22.7 million cumulatively in transaction fees on December 21, 2017, right after bitcoin’s price briefly flirted with $20,000.

Bitcoin’s high transaction fees and scarcity have helped position the cryptocurrency as a store of value. This approach is in direct contrast to other cryptocurrencies, which are striving for low transaction fees and greater consumer traction. They have adopted other algorithms, such as Proof of Stake, in order to achieve this aim. But bitcoin remains unique as the progenitor and original cryptocurrency.

“Unlike your MP3s or digital movies, bitcoins cannot be copied, and this weekend 16.8 million of them have been mined, hoarded and a large number of them have been lost. To many cryptocurrency investors, this makes Satoshi’s invention a very valuable digital asset, unlike anything the world has ever seen,” wrote Jamie Redman, a reporter for bitcoin.com.

Cryptocurrencies are gauged by the size of their market cap. It’s a crude reckoner, but it’s good enough for most purposes. But what about projects that have yet to issue their coins or host their token sale? Increasingly, investors are turning to one metric that’s hard to fake and indicative of widespread support – Telegram followers.

Social Proof is the New Market Cap

Telegram has long been the playground of crypto traders and enthusiasts. The great migration began sometime last summer, after ICO teams tired of running Slack channels that were filled with spam and spoofing. As a side effect of The Grammening, Telegram channel numbers became a useful metric for gauging a project’s support. Twitter followers can be bought, and no one in crypto uses Facebook, creating the perfect storm for Telegram to rise to the top.

Gone are the days when researching new coins and tokens was an esoteric art limited to a handful of crypto traders. Now everyone’s trying to catch the next Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Raiblocks, and that means getting in on the ground floor. Buying a coin as soon as it’s listed on a small exchange is no longer enough. Nor is buying a coin at the ICO stage. These days, true profit comes from getting in at the pre-sale stage, which means getting onto the whitelist – and that isn’t always easy.

Today, for example, registration for Apex Network, which is holding its ICO on the NEO blockchain, closed in 15 minutes – and not before demand had crashed the website and forced Apex to issue an alternate registration link. With even the average ICOs oversubscribed, whitelist places are being offered to supporters who’ve already demonstrated their willingness to get involved with the project – such as by joining the Telegram channel in advance. ICOs are fast becoming an exclusive nightclub. Getting beyond that gilded rope calls for proving to the bouncer that you’re a VIP.

Two Channels, One Project

To help investors gauge which ICOs are gathering the most momentum, ICO Whitelists has set up a tracker page that records which crypto projects have added the most followers in the past 24 hours. As the site explains:

99% of all ICOs use Telegram as a channel to interact with their communities. This means that we can measure the strength of ICO communities by measuring how big these ICO Telegram groups are.

For the most popular projects, one Telegram group is no longer enough. Securities token platform Polymath, this year’s most hyped project, has already hit Telegram’s 50,000 channel limit. Its solution? Open another channel. With many crypto projects still months away from distributing tokens and being listed on exchanges, Telegram popularity has become traders’ estimator tool of choice. When there are 50,000 investors baying to buy in, it’s immaterial what’s in the white paper – hype and FOMO win out every time.

Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp (NYSE: MCB), one of the fastest growing banks in the United States, is used by a number of major cryptocurrency exchanges. But the NYSE traded bank has ceased all cryptocurrency-related international wires effective immediately, according to a Fortune report.

** According to Metropolitan Bank the report written by Fortune is false and the company’s crypto-policies are still intact. Read this article for more information on this story.

“The Bitcoin Bank” Says No to Bitcoin

A Metropolitan customer revealed that his investment firm received a notice on Thursday morning that the bank was “ceasing all international crypto-related wire transfers to and from” it effective immediately. The bank claimed that they could not verify the compliance of international wire transfers for cryptocurrency accounts.

Metropolitan Bank is referred as “The Bitcoin Bank” since it has been used by cryptocurrency companies and investment firms for wire transfers and deposits.

Digital currency wallet Coinbase is among one of the companies that uses it for wire transfers, deposits, and its Shift bitcoin debit card. As the bank hasn’t released any guidance on when it will restore the service, it’s unclear what might happen to the money that existing international clients have in the bank.

More Problems Incoming

Metropolitan Bank’s friendly attitudes towards cryptocurrency has played a role in its rapid growth. But the bank will probably lose traction with its move to shut down crypto-related services.

The decision also puts the bank and the investment firms in a precarious position. Investors’ money will not be returned as U.S. funds are currently holding the capital when conducting business with the bank on behalf of their international clients. It also raise concerns that non-U.S.-based funds who exclusively manage international investors’ money via Metropolitan Bank will be forced to freeze or completely shutter operations.

But the Fortune report noted that MCB’s crypto customers will likely have alternative banks to fall back on.

Listen to This Week in Bitcoin, a podcast updated each Friday.",2018-01-15 16:30:55+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/indonesias-central-bank-cryptocurrency-payments-not-legitimate,"Bank Indonesia has warned that cryptocurrencies may not be used for payments in the country.

The central bank published a press release on Saturday, stating that cryptocurrencies are not a “legitimate instrument of payment” in the country, as they do not comply with the 2011 currency act and are not issued by the Republic of Indonesia.

“Financial transactions conducted within the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, has to be fulfilled with Rupiah,” the currency act states.

As a result, the central bank said that payment firms are not allowed to make virtual currency transactions.

The central bank states:

“Bank Indonesia affirms that it forbids all payment system operator (principal, switching operator, clearing operator, final settlement operator, issuer, acquirer, payment gateway operator, electronic wallet operator, money transfer operator) and financial technology operators in Indonesia, both bank and non-bank institution, to process transactions using virtual currency, as stated in Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 18/40/PBI/2016 on Implementation of Payment Transaction Processing and Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 19/12/PBI/2017 on Implementation of Financial Technology.”

The warning makes no mention of cryptocurrency exchanges.

The news comes after the central bank revealed in early December 2017 that it was considering new regulations that would outlaw bitcoin transactions from 2018.

On the 20th of the same month, the bank issued a new regulation – No. 19/12/PBI/2017 on Implementation of Financial Technology – due to concerns over bitcoin’s potential use in terrorism financing, money laundering and drug trafficking.

In its latest warning, Bank Indonesia also warned “all parties” that buying, selling or trading cryptocurrencies come with “high risks,” as they are “highly volatile” and do not have backing from an authority, or underlying assets to support prices.

The note reads: “This means that virtual currencies are vulnerable to bubble risks, and susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing, therefore can potentially impact financial system stability and cause financial harm to society.”

With the new notice, Bank Indonesia joins a number of global central banks in issuing warnings as the prices of cryptocurrencies have soared amid what many in traditional finance have labelled a bubble. Countries including the U.K., India, Russia and more have recently cautioned investors and traders over the perceived risks involved in cryptocurrencies.

Entitled “Price Manipulation in the Bitcoin Ecosystem” and appearing in the recent issue of the Journal of Monetary Economics the paper describes to what degree the Bitcoin ecosystem is controlled by bad actors.

To many it’s been obvious that the Bitcoin markets are, at the very least, being manipulated by one or two big players. “This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired,” the researchers wrote. “During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.”

The team found that many instances of price manipulation happened simply because the market was very thin for various cryptocurrencies including early Bitcoin. “Despite the huge increase in market capitalization, similar to the bitcoin market in 2013 (the period examined), markets for these other cryptocurrencies are very thin. The number of cryptocurrencies has increased from approximately 80 during the period examined to 843 today! Many of these markets are thin and subject to price manipulation.”

The manipulation happened primarily via two bots, Markus and Willy, that seemed to be performing valid trades but did not actually own the bitcoin they were using. During the Mt. Gox hack a number of these bots were able to create fake trades and make off with millions while manipulating the price of BTC.

The publicly reported trading volume at Mt. Gox included the fraudulent transactions, thereby signaling to the market that heavy trading activity was taking place. Indeed, the paper later shows that even if the fraudulent activity is set aside, average trading volume on all major exchanges trading bitcoins and USD was much higher on days the bots were active. The associated increase in “non-bot” trading was, of course, profitable for Mt. Gox, since it collected transaction fees. But the Willy Bot likely served another purpose as well. A theory, initially espoused in a Reddit post shortly after Mt. Gox’s collapse (Anonymous, 2014b), is that hackers stole a huge number (approximately 650,000) of bitcoins from Mt. Gox in June 2011 and that the exchange owner Mark Karpales took extraordinary steps to cover up the loss for several years.

The bottom line is simple: if Bitcoin wants to be taken seriously it probably shouldn’t be this easy or legal to manipulate the markets. While decentralization is supposed to replace regulation it’s clear that there is still a way to go before it can be truly taken seriously. “As mainstream finance invests in cryptocurrency assets and as countries take steps toward legalizing bitcoin as a payment system (as Japan did in April 2017), it is important to understand how susceptible cryptocurrency markets are to manipulation. Our study provides a first examination,” write the researchers.",2018-01-15,https://news.bitcoin.com/coingeek-funds-a-terabyte-block-initiative-for-bitcoin-cash-with-3-6m-euro/,"Coingeek Funds Terabyte Block Initiative for Bitcoin Cash With 3.6M Euro

On January 15 the cryptocurrency media outlet and blockchain company Coingeek owned and operated by the financial tycoon Calvin Ayre announced funding an initiative called the ‘Terab Project’ with 3.6 million euro. Coingeek alongside its partners Nchain and Lokad, plan to massively scale the bitcoin cash blockchain to terabyte (1 million MB) size blocks which could allow 7 million transactions per second.

Coingeek Plans to Fund Research and Development for Terabyte Sized Blocks

Coingeek.com has revealed to the public that it is funding the open source development of 1 terabyte blocks for the bitcoin cash (BCH) protocol. The company is collaborating with the French quantitative supply chain technology provider, Lokad, as well as support from Nchain and its chief scientist Craig Wright.

“The legacy Segwit bitcoin has shackled its own progress by refusing to allow the current block size cap (1MB) that only allows for 3-4 transactions per second to be lifted and thus has fated the coin to the dustbin of cryptocurrency history,” explains Coingeek’s announcement. But last October, the BCH community welcomed news that a 1 gigabyte (GB) block was successfully mined and propagated through the ‘Gigablock Testnet Initiative,’ the collaboration between Bitcoin Unlimited and Nchain.”

Seven Million Transactions Per Second

Lokad founder, Joannes Vermorel has recently researched and explained that terabyte-size blocks are viable on the BCH chain. By funding the Terab Project with 3.6 million euro, Coingeek believes this type of scaling could improve transaction throughput exponentially stating during the announcement:

A single terabyte block (added every 10 minutes) can contain about 4 billion Bitcoin transactions, and provide capacity of 7 million transactions per second — The scale of a network with 1 TB blocks would be immense, and enable BCH to power not just monetary transactions but machine-to-machine data transactions of many types.

The Terab Project Is Only Meant for a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

Coingeek says that Nchain’s chief scientist Craig Wright will work closely with the Terab Project, and Lokad will hire and manage a team to develop the Terab software. The Terab Project and its features will only be built for the BCH chain. Coingeek’s owner, Calvin Ayre believes this type of development is meant to be applied to Satoshi’s vision a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.”

“The criticisms of cryptocurrencies are very useful as they help us see what hurdles we have to take down in order to achieve low-fee micro-transactions — They are a few more which we will be addressing in due course but rest assured we will prove that BCH is the one true chain,” Ayre details during the Coingeek announcement.

Additionally, Coingeek reveals that it plans to fund more projects that are focused on enabling the growth and adoption of the bitcoin cash network. The company says that if developers within the open source community have ideas or applications they would like to create for BCH they can contact Coingeek for possible funding.

Last week, it emerged that the central government is working to drive out China’s bitcoin miners, who are thought to account for the majority on the planet. Many of the bigger names are already expanding overseas in preparation but the news jolted the market.

There’s also been plenty of speculation around Korea’s plans to regulate crypto, although the government has since clarified it doesn’t plan an all-out ban on bitcoin and crypto trading.

Bitcoin’s slide triggered a selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23 percent on the day at one point, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next biggest, Ripple, plunging by as much as a third.

Bitcoin traded as low as $11,191.59 (£8,127) on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange. In New York trading, it edged up to $12,078, but that was still down 11.2 percent, leaving it on track for its biggest one-day fall since September.

“With reports on a renewed crackdown on the cryptocurrency in China fuelling anxiety over future restrictions, further losses could be on the cards (for bitcoin) in the near term,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM in the UK.

“The sharp depreciation witnessed in bitcoin today should remind investors on how explosively volatile and unpredictable the cryptocurrency can be,” he added.

South Korean news website Yonhap reported that Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon had told a local radio station that the government would be coming up with a set of measures to clamp down on the “irrational” cryptocurrency investment craze.

South Korea said on Monday its plans to ban virtual coin exchanges had not yet been finalised, as government agencies were still in talks to decide how to regulate the market.

FURTHER CHINA CRACKDOWN

That came amid news that a senior Chinese central banker had said authorities should ban centralised trading of virtual currencies and prohibit individuals and businesses from providing related services.

China shut down exchanges operating on the mainland last year - a move that also sparked a selloff, though the market later recovered.

“It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting (bitcoin), with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.

“But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible,” he said.

Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs) - digital token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum.

The latest tumble leaves bitcoin down around 40 percent from a record high near $20,000 hit in mid-December, wiping about $130 billion off its total market value - the unit price multiplied by the number of bitcoins that have been released into the market.

“From a technical standpoint, bitcoin is under pressure on the daily charts,” said Otunuga. “The breakdown below $12,000 may encourage a further decline towards $11,000 and $10,000, respectively.”

A director at Germany’s central bank said on Monday that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual, borderless community.

The latest plunge in the market came as wealth management firm deVere Group, which has $12 billion under advisement, said it was launching a cryptocurrency app that would allow users to store, transfer and exchange five of the biggest digital coins, citing “soaring global demand.”",2018-01-16 09:50:50+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/16/bitcoin-ethereum-south-korea-fears-regulatory-crackdown-cryptocurrency-markets,"The price of bitcoin was sent plummeting 18% as it and other cryptocurrencies yo-yo in value over fears of a wider trading crackdown spurred by renewed potential of South Korean regulatory action.



Bitcoin’s slide of over over $2,200 triggered a massive selloff across the broader cryptocurrency market, with biggest rival Ethereum down 23% on the day, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, and the next biggest, Ripple, plunging 33%.

Following initial statements that South Korea was looking to ban trading of cryptocurrencies, followed by a climbdown, the country’s finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in an interview with local radio station TBS that banning trading in digital currencies was “a live option”.

Kim said: “There are no disagreements over regulating speculation,” such as using real-name accounts and levying taxes on cryptocurrency trading. Shutting down digital currency exchanges is “a live option but government ministries need to very seriously review it,” he added.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.



Following the latest news, Bitcoin traded as low as $11,191.59 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, down 18% on the day for a short period, putting the digital currency on track for its biggest one-day fall in three years.

“It’s mainly been regulatory issues which are haunting the cryptocurrency, with news around South Korea’s further crackdown on trading the driver today,” said Think Markets chief strategist Naeem Aslam, who holds what he described as “substantial” amounts of bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple. “But we maintain our stance. We do not think that the complete banning of cryptocurrencies is possible.”

Joachim Wuermeling, a director of Germany’s national bank, said on Monday that national rules are likely to prove ineffective given the borderless bitcoin’s global scale. He said: “Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation, because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited.”

European Union states and legislators agreed last month on stricter rules to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing on exchange platforms for bitcoin and other virtual currencies.

Meanwhile, Chinese regulators have banned initial coin offerings (ICOs), shut down local cryptocurrency trading exchanges and limited bitcoin mining. Chinese authorities also plan to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralised trading, Bloomberg reported on Monday.

Cryptocurrencies enjoyed a bumper year, with bitcoin hitting a high of about $20,000 in 2017 as mainstream investors entered the market and an explosion in ICOs drove demand for bitcoin and Ethereum.

The latest tumble left bitcoin down more than 40% from the record high in mid-December, wiping about $130bn billion off its “market cap” – the unit price multiplied by the total number of bitcoins that have been released into the market.

“[It] seems like it’s uncertainty spooking the markets … with regulations unclear,” said Charles Hayter, founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare. “[Traders] are taking profits on the increased risk scenarios going forward.”

The price of bitcoin was fluctuating to under $12,000 by publication time, according to Bitstamp.

2017’s 1,500% rise in the value of bitcoin has made billionaires out of early investors such as the Winklevoss twins, and seen some such as the Pineapple Fund turn to philanthropic endeavours.



But high-profile investor Warren Buffett recently said he would never invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, predicting that the assets are in for a fall.

Many do not share Buffett’s scepticism.

Cryptocurrency markets are having a tough time during the third week of the new year as a vast majority of digital assets are down 20 percent or more. Currently, the BTC/USD global average is roughly $12,050 after touching a high of $14,300 just 24-hours prior. The sudden losses started taking place yesterday evening when bitcoin markets dipped into the $13K territory. Uncertain digital asset traders are debating on whether or not markets will rebound soon or plunge to some more lower bound figures in the near future.

The January Crypto-Slumps

2018 hasn’t been the best time for those looking for the currency to reach its all-time highs again. In fact, since its top of $19,600 across global exchanges back in December bitcoin markets and many other cryptocurrencies values have tumbled significantly. During this past weekend, BTC/USD markets were fluttering around the $13,300 region but kicked into higher gear during the morning of Monday, January 15. Since then on Tuesday, January 16 things are a whole lot different, and the price is now averaging just above $12K per BTC and saw a low of $11,600 earlier this morning.

Global trade volume is high at $15.5Bn worth of BTC traded over the past 24-hours with the USD capturing 40 percent of that action. The Japanese yen is a bit lower this week with only 29 percent of the BTC trade volume. The last three currencies traded with bitcoin core markets include tether (USDT 10%), the euro (7.9%), and the Korean won (which has slumped to 3.8 percent). The top five exchanges trading the most BTC today include Bitfinex, Okex, Upbit, Binance, and GDAX. Further, the most traded cryptocurrency paired with BTC on January 16 is ethereum (ETH).

Technical Indicators

Looking at charts like the daily and hourly shows a significant slide in value since bitcoin core markets tapped $14,300 on Monday. At that time when the price was more bullish the two Simple Moving Averages, including the 100 and 200 SMA, had crossed paths briefly with the 100 above the longer term trendline. The gap was small, and the two crossed hairs again on Monday bringing the short term 100 SMA below the 200, once again showing bearish sentiment is in the air. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Stochastic oscillators are heading northbound, showing some traders are buying this particular dip and consolidation may form in within the current price range.

Looking ahead, order books show some tough resistance at $12,700 and things get thicker above that region. If bulls can manage to break the $13K zone, some smoother sailing could return. On the backside, watch for the Displaced Moving Average to break $11,150 and if it does the $10K zone is could be imminent.

The Top 68 Cryptocurrencies Are Down Between 15-40%

So the dip has affected a great majority of digital assets as the top 68 cryptocurrency market capitalizations (except for tether USDT) are all in red seeing significant losses. The second highest market cap held by ethereum (ETH) is down 15 percent as one ETH is valued at $1,115. Ripple (XRP) is still commanding the third position, but markets are down 23 percent. The price per XRP is currently $1.40 or half of what it was two weeks ago. Bitcoin cash (BCH) prices are down 19 percent as one BCH is valued at $1,979 on January 16. Lastly, the fifth position is still held by cardano (ADA), but its markets have dipped 22 percent as one token is averaging $0.65. As usual, when market dumps proliferate, tether (USDT) is up 1.12 percent and priced at $1.02 per coin commanding the fourth highest crypto-trade volume.

The Verdict

Its safe to say cryptocurrency proponents are uncertain especially with the media hype and regulatory rumors stemming from countries like China and South Korea. Unfortunately, the reports have been conflicting, and no one has been able to pinpoint what is actually happening. For instance, South Korean trade volume is still very active and many cryptocurrencies there are trading at a premium ($14,775 per BTC on Upbit). Trade volume with the South Korean won has only dropped 1 percent since last week and exchanges are still trading many different cryptocurrencies.

Lastly, the rumors remind people of what happened January in 2017 when the PBOC started its exchange crackdown. Bitcoin’s price dropped from the $1,100 range at the time back into the $700 region following China’s regulatory action. Further, the price of BTC has dipped below its 50-day average which is traditionally followed by bullish sentiment looking at older charts. Alongside this, looking at charts from years prior, shows consistent dumps have taken place over the course of the past four years. After the January slumps the price has always bounced back to all new highs and traders are hopeful it will be the case again this time around.

Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there’s a case to be made for adding another “basic layer” to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users’ past trips, credit cards, favorite locations — all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn’t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you’d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.

How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.

As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.

“You think about the ’90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,” Dixon says. “You’re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.”

Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. “How can we fix the internet if we can’t even make coffee?” she said with a laugh.

Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone’s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta’s, “headquarters” seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers’ collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum’s smart contracts into their own systems.

The true test of the blockchain will revolve — like so many of the online crises of the past few years — around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don’t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn’t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can’t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).",2018-01-16,https://qz.com/1181439/bitcoin-btc-price-tumbles-as-china-plans-to-widen-crackdown-on-cryptocurrency-trading/,"New technology is upending everything in finance, from saving to trading to making payments.

China is set on stopping its citizens from trading bitcoin.

Chinese authorities plan to widen their crackdown on domestic crypto-trades, by targeting methods including over-the-counter trading, offshore sites used for centralized trading, and peer-to-peer trading of large transactions, according to a report from the state-run Securities Times (link in Chinese) published yesterday (Jan. 16). The report cited an anonymous person close to the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, the country’s top internet-finance regulator. It didn’t specify how authorities will define these platforms or carry out such crackdowns.

Citing unnamed sources, Bloomberg also reported the same day that officials will block domestic access to local and offshore platforms that provide centralized trading, and target people who provide bids and offers for crypto trades in large amounts. Bitcoin’s price fell to the lowest level in more than a month over the news.

Amid fears of financial chaos, the Chinese government in September banned crypto trading on domestic exchanges, effectively putting an end to yuan-bitcoin exchange markets, once the world’s largest driver of bitcoin trading volume. In the wake of the crackdown, China’s major exchange operators like Huobi and OKCoin shifted operations overseas. Founded by their respective parent exchanges, Huobi Pro and OKEx are two Hong Kong-based platforms that provide crypto-to-crypto and over-the-counter trading, whose services are still available to Chinese citizens. Huobi is also planning to set up two crypto exchanges in Japan this year.

China’s crypto investors, meanwhile, have flocked to messaging app Telegram to keep the trades going. Many of these chat groups have attracted hundreds of users negotiating prices directly, and group administrators have implemented “know your customer” policies to prevent fraud and money laundering.

Pan Gongsheng, a vice governor of the Chinese central bank, said in a recent meeting that China will continue to apply pressure on domestic crypto-trades for the sake of financial stability, according to Reuters, citing an internal memo. He was quoted as saying: “Pseudo-financial innovations that have no relationship with the real economy should not be supported.”

Pan, who also heads China’s internet-finance regulator, has vowed to end bitcoin mining in the country. Earlier this month, the body issued a notice asking local governments to “guide” bitcoin-mining operations to make an “orderly exit” from the business. In response, ViaBTC, one of the world’s largest bitcoin mining pools, has raised its management fee from 6% to 50%, citing China’s “scarce” mining resources due to policy reasons.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN1F52AB,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday warned that Venezuela’s proposed “petro” cryptocurrency could violate sanctions against the OPEC nation’s socialist government, a statement that could dent investor appetite for the soon-to-be-launched token.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro this month said his government will soon issue 100 million petros, backed by an equivalent number of barrels of oil, partly to get around the U.S. sanctions.

Those sanctions prohibit the purchase of newly issued Venezuelan debt, which has left Maduro unable to refinance the country’s crippling debt burden and led Socialist Party officials to seek new forms of raising hard currency.

Maduro is seeking to capitalize on the success of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin by creating one for Venezuela as its traditional currency, the bolivar, plunges to all-time lows against the dollar and the country struggles with hyperinflation.

“The petro digital currency would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government ... (and) could therefore expose U.S. persons to legal risk,” a Treasury spokesman told Reuters on Tuesday.

“(It) is another attempt to prop up the Maduro regime, while further looting the resources of the Venezuelan people.”

Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The OPEC nation, struggling with widespread shortages of food and medicine, is seeking to raise hard currency amid the crippling crisis.

U.S. banks have grown more cautious about operations involving Venezuela since Washington imposed sanctions, exposing them to legal and reputational risks, finance industry sources said.

The United States is considered a crucial source of capital for securities and tokens because of the size of its economy and because many global financial operations at some point pass through U.S. financial institutions.

Maduro has said each petro will be backed by one barrel of Venezuelan oil and will be sold at the same price, which last week averaged $60.40 per barrel.

That would put the value of the entire petro issuance of 100 million tokens at just over $6 billion.

Venezuela’s government has not provided any description of whether or how investors could collect the oil backing petro holdings.

PROPOSED PRIVATE OFFERING

Advisers to the Venezuelan government are recommending it sell $2.3 billion of its new cryptocurrency in a private offering at a discount of up to 60 percent, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.

The recommendation by newly formed advisory group VIBE, made up of cryptocurrency experts close to the government, indicates that Maduro’s valuation of the nascent petro faces significant market skepticism.

“The center of financial policy will be the consolidation of the petro,” said Maduro in his annual message on Monday. “This cryptocurrency is the future of humanity. Venezuela has entered the future.”

However, many were left confused.

Venezuela’s opposition-run Congress has declared the petro an illegal debt issuance by a government desperate for cash, and has said it will not recognize it.

VIBE recommended Venezuela sell 38.4 million petros with a face value of around $2.3 billion in private placements starting on Feb. 15 at a discount of up to 60 percent.

Another 44 million petros with a face value of $2.7 billion should be offered to the public a month later.

The remainder should be shared between the government and VIBE, the document said.

High-ranking government advisers have discussed the proposal, according to a source familiar with the situation. It was not immediately clear if the proposal would be accepted.

The document suggested the government accept tax payments in petros, and that state oil company PDVSA incorporate cryptocurrencies in its dealings with foreign companies.

The country’s opposition said it is illegal to use oil reserves — of which Venezuela has the largest in the world — to issue debt.

Maduro said the cryptocurrency issuance would take place via online exchanges, but he did not give further details.

Some of the exchanges would work with bolivars, Venezuela’s collapsing local currency, while others would exchange other cryptocurrencies for the petro, said an adviser.

The petro will be pre-mined, meaning that unlike bitcoin, for example, new tokens cannot be created. This is the case with another popular cryptocurrency, ripple.

The document suggested the petro be a token on the Ethereum network, widely used by the cryptocurrency community.

According to CoinMarketCap data, ethereum was trading 15 percent lower near $885 a coin, while ripple fell nearly 14 percent to around $1.02. Cryptocurrencies appeared to sell off shortly after South Korea's Finance Minister, Kim Dong-yeon, said the country was still mulling a shutdown of crypto exchanges. Initial reports of South Korea — one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets in the world — moving to clamp down on virtual currency trading last week sent the price of bitcoin and a number of other major digital assets down sharply. ""The action we're seeing may seem dramatic but is really quite normal for this market,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, told CNBC via email. ""All in all, this drop has brought us back to the prices that were traded about a month ago for most coins."" Greenspan said Tuesday that South Korean and Japanese investors often pay a premium of ""20 percent or more per coin,"" but on Wednesday said they appeared to be falling.

""The premiums that were being paid by Japanese and South Korean crypto traders is also coming down, so that's a good sign as well,"" he said.

'No other justification than fear'

China was also reportedly looking to deepen its crackdown on the cryptocurrency market this week. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that authorities in China were planning to block domestic access to Chinese and offshore cryptocurrency platforms that allow centralized trading. Regulators will also target people and companies that provide market-making, settlement and clearing services for centralized trading, the publication said, citing unnamed sources. And on Tuesday, a Chinese central bank official reportedly said that authorities should ban the centralized trading of digital currencies, adding weight to concerns of further suppression of the country's cryptocurrency market. Charles Hayter, chief executive of CryptoCompare, said that many expected the cryptocurrency market to decline. ""The market was very overheated and had significantly dislocated from trend. A large percentage of investors were expecting this correction and reversion to mean."" Hayter said that panic was ""leading the herd to sell with no other justification than fear,"" but added that it was ""difficult to say"" where the market would be headed next. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile assets. Many experts believe that the introduction of futures contracts for bitcoin from the likes of CME and Cboe would tame the digital currency somewhat and bring in more institutional money. — CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.

The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is hovering around $450 billion, down ~30 percent from $650 billion just 48 hours ago.

Yesterday, Bitcoin was just a few dollars away from dropping below $10,000, but it bounced back around $11k, a 15% drop from two days before. But Bitcoin is now trading below $10,000 on most major exchanges right now.

In the past 24 hours, ETH is down 22.5 percent to around $850, Ripple is down 26.3 percent to $1.03, and so on. Unlike some crashes where we see value flood from one cryptocurrency into another, this sell off was traders exiting into fiat.

Interestingly, Tether is the sole token in the top 50 that’s not down over the past seven days, and that’s because the price typically rises slightly above $1 when there is a demand to “cash out” into the stabilized token.

Per usual, there’s no real rhyme or reason to this selloff. Two days ago, we reported on rumors that some Asian countries were moving to regulate the cryptocurrency trading and mining industry, but there hasn’t really been any concrete news on this front yet.

Regardless of the reasons some in the cryptocurrency community are happy that the market is seeing at least some degree of a correction, as it keeps realities in check and is generally better for the long-term prospects of the industry.

Bitcoin Hits Rock Bottom

2018 is scarcely older than a fortnight and already it’s shaping up to be more action-packed, exhilarating, and occasionally terrifying than the previous year. To date January has witnessed the rise of vaporware, billion dollar market caps gained and lost, and XRP rise up to threaten The Rippening before slinking back to its corner. At its lowest point on Tuesday, Ripple came close to the dollar mark, down 65% from its January high.

While some traders panic sold and others hodled for dear life, a few tried to ride the waves that saw bitcoin buffeted every which way. At least one trader called it right, noting the previous support line that bitcoin would bounce off, and so it proved to be. 100 million tethers were released into the fray in what one trader dubbed crypto’s “quantitive easing”, unleashing a green candle that temporarily spared bitcoin’s blushes. Despite clawing its way back over $11k and holding $11,200 for a few hours, as of Wednesday 9am (NYT), BTC is close to four figures once more.

Altcoins haven’t fared so well either. Just three of the cryptocurrency top 100 posted gains on Tuesday – or four including tether – with Quantstamp, Neblio, and Ethos the only winners. Bitcoin finished the day down 15%, whereas alts such as Verge, Ripple, and Tron all shed over 20% of their value. Tron, which once occupied a spot in the top five, is now down to 14th and fading fast.

New Year, New Low

Bitcoin is a capricious beast at the best of times, but it’s been more erratic than ever since the turn of the year. Rumors of a South Korean crypto crackdown have proliferated for weeks, but thus far they’ve been just that. Trying to dampen the nation’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrency – a movement that as many as 1 in 25 South Koreans are believed to be actively involved in – will require more than the disapproval of a few ministers.

As news.Bitcoin.com recently observed:

Cryptocurrencies have been threatened at one point or another by nearly every country on the planet. Rarely does a government venture beyond rhetoric…Be they communist strongholds or liberal democracies, bitcoin cannot be stopped.

For so long as the Asian markets dominate bitcoin trading volume, South Korea, Japan, and China will serve as the tail that wags the dog. Like it or not, westerners are beholden to the movement of markets beyond their reach, and there is little they can do to mitigate that during spells of uncertainty other than to migrate into the safety of USD tethers and wait it out.

Neo Goes Loco

It seems fitting that a coin named Neo should start the new year with its greatest run to date. On Monday it was the only asset in the cryptocurrency top 100 to be in the green. Despite dipping since, Neo, together with Gas, the fuel used to run smart contracts on the network, has been a rare ray of light amidst the doom and gloom. The “Chinese Ethereum” is finally proving its worth, with a string of ICOs launching on the network this month, and a level of side-chain and ecosystem developments in the works that are justifying Neo’s newfound valuation.

In 2017, there were just two major Neo ICOS, for Qlink and Red Pulse. 2018, in comparison, has 20 penciled in already. Ethereum, January’s other consistent performer in the crypto top 10, has similarly been buoyed by the spate of ICOs in the works. Token Data reports that $570 million was raised by 23 ICOs in the first two weeks of 2018, and a total of 60 token sales are launching this week – the highest level since October.

If historical indicators are anything to go by, bitcoin will rally and finish the month higher than it began before going on to enjoy another bumper year. There may be more pain to endure though before the clouds lift and bitcoin can start eyeing another all-time high. Ari Paul’s prediction, ventured last week, might not be so outlandish after all:

The company, which made its foray into the cryptocurrency scene with an initial coin offering (ICO) in late December 2016, swiftly cemented its position as one of 2017’s best performing currencies on CoinMarketCap. Indeed, during its heyday, BitConnect boasted a market cap of over $2.6 billion and a value exceeding the $400 mark.

But despite its meteoric growth and burgeoning user base, the investment platform attracted a swarm of naysayers with its suspicious business model, which vocal critics repeatedly labeled a Ponzi scheme.

Guaranteed to earn investors up to 40 percent total return per month, BitConnect followed a four-tier investment system based on the sum of initial deposit – the more cash you put down, the bigger and faster profits you could rake in.

Regardless of the stake though, investors were promised a one-percent return of investment (ROI) on a daily basis. To this end, the company had developed its own proprietary “trading bot and volatility software” that would turn your Bitcoin investment into a fortune. Or so the information provided on the website suggested.

This meant that salting $1,000 away into your BitConnect investment account could net you more than $50 million within three years, assuming the scheme does indeed live up to its promise for one-percent interest compounded on a daily basis. Needless to say though, many deemed this model unsustainable.

Among the first ones to voice his concern with the company was Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. “If [one percent per day] is what they offer,” he said on Twitter back in November, “then that’s a [P]onzi [scheme].”

Despite these warnings, BitConnect continued to pick up momentum.

Indeed, the company relied on an aggressive marketing strategy on all fronts. Putting aside its extensive digital and event marketing efforts, the company had enlisted a large army of multi-level affiliate marketers to recruit new investors, who could then work their way up by bringing in even more new investors – and so on and so on. In the real world, we call this a pyramid scheme.

An image used by BitConnect to explain how its affiliate program works – nothing suspicious about the example, of course.

Other than “educating” prospective investors about BitConnect, the sketchy marketers engaged in copious amounts of blatant shilling for the dodgy investment platform and its BCC coin.

The tactic, which the promoters employed across multiple channels and social media platforms, essentially involved ballyhooing the Bitcoin investment service by touting screenshots of the impressive “profits” BitConnect has brought them; that is despite the fact that most of their winnings came from affiliates – not investing.

Still, BitConnect was thriving with this disingenuous approach, attracting hordes of naive backers willing to put down their money. Indeed, the ingenuity of this method became most apparent when the platform began facing its first legal troubles.

As one of the 20 biggest cryptocurrencies by marketshare, by that time the bullish investment service had expanded enough to attract the attention of the authorities. Following an investigation in November, the British Registrar of Companies served BitConnect with a strike-off notice, threatening to shut it down and dissolve its operation unless further action is taken.

“Upon dissolution all property and rights vested in, or held in trust for, the company are deemed to be bona vacantia, and accordingly will belong to the crown,” the filings read.

Within a week, the news had reached mainstream media, with numerous outlets reporting on the affair and thousands of spooked investors speculating about the implications on Reddit. This is when the promoter emergency task force stormed in, spewing all sorts of mindless crap to dispel this “fake news.”

In fact, TNW was the star of one of these videos, created by a promoter better known as Ryan Hildreth. Hildreth has since wiped the video from his own YouTube channel, but someone was thoughtful enough to save and re-upload it. (Update: the video has since been deleted again)

Downplaying the legal threats, the promoters stuck to the script and continued to shill BitConnect. Instead, they suggested that the strike-off notice affected only a limited division of the company (BITCONNECT LTD), and thus would bear no repercussions for its main registration (BITCONNECT INTERNATIONAL PLC).

Following a closer look at the multiple instances under which the company was listed on the British Companies House website, it became clear that BitConnect had concealed – and possibly lied about – numerous material facts about its operation, including its location and the identity of its founding members.

Unfortunately, none of these warning signals seemed to have instilled a sense of doubt in the minds of the numerous investors. In the meantime, BitConnect was tirelessly working on upscaling its reputation and building up its brand worldwide to distract naive backers from the real troubles it was facing.

The company had signed a partnership with Blockchain Expo where it had its own stand in California, it attended the ICO EVENT conference in Amsterdam as a sponsor, and even hosted its own gaudy suit-and-gown gala night in Thailand. In fact, the last venue was where the notorious BitConnect meme was born.

Things would soon begin taking a turn for the worst though.

Less than two weeks ago, BitConnect got slapped with a cease and desist letter from the Texas Securities Board, ordering the company to close down its operation and cut distribution of BCC – at least until it had worked out an agreement with the Securities Commissioner or was granted the necessary exemptions to continue its business.

The notice from the Texas Securities board was followed by yet another cease and desist letter a week later – this time around from the North Carolina Securities Division.

Both filings insisted BitConnect was running a potentially fraudulent operation, implicating the company in a series of violations. Interestingly though, the North Carolina notice also suggested that the BitConnect promoters – who had accumulated thousands of dollars in profits – were also breaking the law.

Shortly after this news, the once-devoted promoters began distancing themselves from the platform, claiming they never endorsed it in the first place. Some of them went on to purge their entire YouTube channels, while others simply moved on to shilling other cryptocurrencies.

In the meantime, BitConnect had come up with a creative approach to distracting users away from the litany of “bad press” it was bombarded with.

The company had launched its own news segment – perhaps as a strategy to raise its SEO profile. But its content output was steady enough for Google to list the platform as a “legitimate” news source, displaying it in the dedicated news carousel on Search – side by side other credible medias.

This might seem like a harmless little change, but the outcome was thoroughly sinister.

Now that BitConnect had a regular stream of content, anyone Googling the company would be met with news bits produced by BitConnect itself. What was particularly problematic is that legitimate news pieces were now slumped under a pile of meaningless content.

Just like this, BitConnect had found a way to sweep all negative coverage under the rug by simply churning out more content – as far as Google search went at least.

It was only yesterday when BitConnect’s shenanigans were finally starting to catch up with them.

Following a streak of server downtime, the company revealed that it was shutting down its lending and exchange platform. Above anything else, it attributed its fall to “bad press.” Though it did acknowledge that legal troubles and continuous DDoS attacks had also played a role in this decision.

“We are closing the lending operation immediately with the release of all outstanding loans,” the statement read. “With release of your entire active loan in the lending wallet we are transferring all your lending wallet balance to your BitConnect wallet balance at 363.62 USD [sic].”

“In short,” it continued, “we are closing lending service and exchange service while BitConnect.co website will operate for wallet service, news and educational purposes.”

In the aftermath of the announcement, BCC collapsed almost in an instant, plunging all the way down to under $30 – a monstrous 96-percent decrease in value.

Immediately after the ominous announcement began spreading across the net, hives of freaked out investors flocked to the BitConnect subreddit (which has since been locked down). The segment was flush with panicked posts.

“This cant be it. I lost everything. EVERYTHING,” one thread read. Another one – titled “800-273-8255 is the Suicide Hotline. Money Isn’t everything. Your life still matters after all of this” – encouraged distraught investors to stay calm and not do anything drastic. This is how deep the impact of BitConnect’s fraudulent operation is.

If that hadn’t become apparent by now, BitConnect was extremely popular across the board.

To give you a better perspective on the magnitude of damage BitConnect’s shifty business has caused to its thousands of investors, its site has been translated to several different languages – including Vietnamese, South Korean, Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, Thai, Cambodian and Filipino.

So why is it important to document the trickeries BitConnect resorted to? Because the signs were always there.

While the Bitcoin investment platform is practically defunct now, it has inspired a slew of copycats – including EthConnect (based on Ethereum), XRPConnect (based on Ripple), and NEOConnect (based on NEO). It is also important to remember that its BitConnect X ICO continues to be active.

Ignoring the fraudulent tactics that made BitConnect the behemoth that it was is tantamount to risking falling victim to the same scheme again – and we should do our best to avoid such traps.

So instead of writing it off, BitConnect must live on as a cautionary tale to every cryptocurrency rookie placing all of their eggs in a bottomless basket.

""I don't view it as payment system player,"" Alfred Kelly said in an interview recorded on Tuesday at the National Retail Federation conference in New York City.

Despite the emergence of bitcoin as digital money that can be used in a limited fashion to buy things, Kelly said, ""We at Visa won't process transactions that are cryptocurrency-based. We will only process fiat currency-based transactions.""

Fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are issued by governments as legal money. But, as Investopedia describes it, they are not backed by any physical commodity.

Bitcoin, as CoinDesk explains, is not issued by anyone. It's ""mined"" or ""discovered"" by powerful computers around the world competing with each other to solve certain algorithms. The miners then write those transactions to the online blockchain ledger, where all activity is recorded and shared with everyone.

In the current environment, bitcoin acceptance as payment is rather limited, but as prices have soared, it's become widely traded as a store of value like gold.

""My take is that bitcoin is much more today a commodity that somebody could invest in; and honestly, somewhat of a speculative commodity,"" said Kelly, who became the chief executive of Visa in December 2016.

Speculative indeed, considering bitcoin prices lost about a quarter of their value in the past two days and were cut in about half since last month's record high above $19,000. But even with the recent plunge, bitcoin is still up more than 1,000 percent in the past 12 months.

Earlier Wednesday, on Bank of America's post-earnings conference call with analysts, Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan responded to a question about cryptocurrencies after the financial giant banned its advisors from buying bitcoin-related investments for their clients.

Having issued a stark warning to “all parties” against any use of “virtual currency”, Bank Indonesia has now joined forces with local police to prevent bitcoin transactions where they are most likely to take place – in Bali. The island, a popular holiday destination with tourists spending both fiat and crypto, has been targeted by authorities. Inspections of businesses accepting bitcoin are underway, according to Indonesian media and the crypto community in the country.

Authorities on the Lookout for Illegal Transactions

Representatives of the Indonesian central bank and the national police force on the island have teamed up to investigate cases of cryptocurrency trading deemed illegal by authorities in Jakarta. They have already started collecting information about possible violations.

The crackdown in Bali comes after BI declared bitcoin an illegal form of payment in the country. Virtual currencies are prohibited in Indonesia, the financial institution stated. Rupiahs should be used for all payments and transactions that need money. The banning statement came with plans to swiftly implement the rules:

We are looking out for bitcoin transactions in Bali, particularly in tourist spots. We will take measures against non-rupiah transactions.

That announcement was made by the head of BI’s local branch Causa Iman Karana, who called the island “an alluring place for those who want to carry out illegal transactions”. Quoted by local press, Karana said in Denpasar that institutions had already warned people not to use virtual money “because there is no authority that regulates transactions”.

Businesses Can Be Closed, Owners Taken to Court

Members of the crypto community on the island quickly shared the news of the imminent crackdown in social media. Warnings were posted about checks expected to be carried out by bank officials and local law enforcement officers. Businesses could be suspended and owners taken to court, if they accept bitcoin payments. A villa has been reportedly closed down by inspectors. A foreign national had been used as a “mystery customer”… according to comments on the Bitcoins in Bali Facebook page.

Bali has been put in the spotlight after the announced prohibition of payments involving bitcoin. BI’s spokesman Agusman Zainal said that such transactions violated Law No. 7/2011 regulating currencies and their transactions in the country.

The ban has been further detailed in a dedicated bank regulation No. PBI: 19/12/PBI/2017 covering the implementation of financial technology. Under the current law, any payment in Indonesia should be made in the national currency, the Rupiah.

The central bank official also pointed to the risks associated with bitcoin transactions, noting that the cryptocurrency had no “official administrator”. Money laundering, terrorism and other criminal activities were added to the ubiquitous list of unwanted side effects.

Indonesians had been notified about the restrictions long before BI issued its ultimate warning to “not buy, sell, or trade virtual currency”. The assault on Bali shows that Jakarta means business. But what the crackdown means for the business, only time will show.

Scaling problems that have been sporadically affecting the Ethereum network have resurfaced. While bulls and bears were battling it out in the markets, the Ethereum blockchain was fighting to restore some semblance of normal service. The congestion forced a number of exchanges to halt withdrawals, with one going so far as to advise customers to use a different cryptocurrency.

Ethereum Enters the Slow Lane

Over the last couple of months, the Ethereum network has reported record activity, peaking at over one million transactions a day. This growth has come at a price in the form of slow or backlogged transactions, causing fees to reach record highs and ICO participants to miss out on token sales after failing to push their ether through in time. On Wednesday January 17, two exchanges reported ethereum withdrawal issues that were affecting users.

First up was Bitstamp, which noted that there were ETH withdrawal delays, before updating the situation four hours later to say the matter had been resolved. Users of Kucoin exchange have been more significantly affected on account of ethereum withdrawal delays that have dragged on for days. The exchange posted the following notice on Wednesday, including a novel suggestion: that users withdraw in neo instead of ether. This suggestion is unlikely to have been of much help to users who needed their ETH to interact with the ethereum ecosystem.

More Gas, More Money, More Problems

Following the notice, Kucoin followed up with a blog post containing a form to be filled in by users who were still waiting for their ethereum withdrawals to be processed. A week prior, the exchange had explained that ETH withdrawals were subject to delays as they were being released at four-hour intervals. Not everyone has been convinced by Kucoin’s decision to lay the blame on the Ethereum network though, with some users pointing out that the exchange’s ETH withdrawal fees are five times higher than on other sites, which seem to be processing transactions just fine.

What is beyond dispute is that numerous exchanges have encountered similar problems of late, with Bittrex reporting only a week ago: “Due to incredibly high gas prices, we’re preventing new ETH and asset deposit addresses from being created. Existing deposit addresses will work as normal.”

Eth Gas Station currently reports fast transactions as requiring 51 gwei, or around $0.93 to process. The web is awash with crypto projects promising that their new blockchain can handle a gazillion transactions a second. The reality, however, is that if these networks were ever to be stress tested in the wild like Ethereum or Bitcoin, they would face the exact same same problems. Scaling blockchains while preserving decentralization is even harder than it sounds.

Do you think scaling problems are inevitable as blockchains become busier? Let us know in the comments section below.

Poof. Gone in 36 hours.

This week’s cryptocurrency market crash erased paper fortunes and likely churned a few stomachs belonging to new investors who had been piling into the space.

While the market has been in a frenzy over the past few months – with the majority of coins reaching all-time-highs while the market caps of cryptocurrencies with little technical development (Dogecoin) and niche business opportunity (Dentacoin) surged past $1 billion in network value – starting Tuesday morning, it began shedding weight.

Lots and lots of it, in fact. Most of the major cryptocurrencies saw double-digit drops continuing until Wednesday. The two most popular cryptocurrencies (and the two largest by market cap), bitcoin and ethereum, dipped below the psychological price levels surpassed last year – $10,000 and $1,000, respectively.

And XRP, the native cryptocurrency of enterprise blockchain startup Ripple Inc., lost nearly 50 percent of its value on Tuesday, after a month-long bull run that made the coin a retail investor darling and the apple of a startup’s eye.

As always, crypto-enthusiasts took to social media to restate their HODL-ing patterns and declare that this, in fact, is a great time to buy.

But others, who haven’t held on through the ups and downs of the last four-plus years, and might even have been some of the reason (i.e., panic selling) the markets tanked so hard, might be wondering what just happened.

And as the markets begin to regain some of their position going into Wednesday night, it’s hard to pinpoint anything specific, but there’s a confluence of events surmised to have driven the couple days of red.

Bitter taste of regs

By far, the most prevalent explanation is that harsh stances by governments in China and more recently, South Korea, led many investors to flee.

China, for one, has caused the markets to drop in the past. For instance, when the People’s Bank of China banned payment companies from working with bitcoin exchanges in 2013, the market immediately dipped.

And although there was some market clamor in September when China banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and moved to shut down crypto exchanges in the country, the market for cryptocurrency trading has diversified significantly, and as such, the markets took far less time to recover.

More recently, though, South Korea regulators have been hammering on the crypto industry all month, with banks facing scrutiny over crypto exchange relationships and investors facing fines for anonymous trading accounts, the latter of which was disclosed on Monday.

Still, any news of strict regulation will “add pressure to the downside,” said Lanre Sarumi, CEO at risk management system providers Riskbone and the CEO of Leveltradingfield, which designed a game that allows people to place bets on the future price of bitcoin.

And Michael Graham, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, an investment bank in New York, echoed that sentiment, saying that the regulatory rumblings have “helped people start to create more of a cautious narrative that’s sort of feeding on itself.”

Back to the futures?

Secondly – and perhaps interesting in its counterintuitiveness – is that far more technical people are a part of the cryptocurrency markets now, and according to Sarumi, that demographic shift of sorts could be exacerbating the downturn.

While the interest in cryptocurrencies by these sophisticated investors has been widely seen as a beneficial development, their use of complex market tools can have effects on the price that many in the crypto scene, especially novice retail investors, might not see as positive.

For instance, more experienced investors “are putting their stop loss triggers at support levels,” Sarumi said.

A stop loss is an order placed with a broker to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price. If a significant number of investors have stop losses around the same price, and if the price dips below that number, those sell orders are placed at once without demand on the other side. The sell-off could trigger others to panic sell, as they might think the market is crashing.

Sarumi continued:

“Once those levels are breached, the stop orders flood the market adding additional pressure to the downside.”

Plus, the debut of bitcoin futures on Cboe and CME last month was also viewed with optimism, as a sign of the industry maturing, but the expiration of the futures contracts this week was a source of some trepidation.

Because the futures product is so new, and the development of derivatives is key to the crypto markets’ maturation, some were “nervous about the first expiration,” Graham said. “If we can get through a few closings, it will give people confidence” in the crypto sector. (Earlier today, Cboe’s first bitcoin futures contract expired.)

In this way, there isn’t yet a huge number of institutional investors jumping in that would keep the market more stable.

Lights out at exchanges

The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has also put a strain on market infrastructure.

“Pretty much all the companies in the space are facing the influx of new users … and it’s taken a toll on most companies,” said Nejc Kodric, CEO of Bitstamp, a crypto exchange which has been around since 2011.

For one, several exchanges have stopped taking new users. Bitfinex, for example, temporarily curtailed account registrations in December “in a move designed to preserve the trading, support, and verification experiences of our existing, long-term user base,” the company said in a blog post last week. It said Friday it had resumed new account openings.

And further, many users of the U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken were up in arms when a software upgrade, which was supposed to take two hours lasted nearly two days, halting trading for the same time period.

While most understand the ecosystem is still new and, as such, prone to problems, when market infrastructure goes down, many people get worried.

Adding further fuel to the fire, BitConnect announced it would close its lending and exchange platform, causing the company’s BCC token to crater and leaving holders at least temporarily unable to cash out.

Speaking to investors’ instinct over recent days to sell or at least stay on the sidelines, Graham concluded:

“Put all those together and it’s easy to create a narrative that ‘hey, the market’s kind of overheated and needs to take a break.'”

Loading...

Over the last month, in a series of volatile swings, the price of the cryptocurrency bitcoin rose to a record high — then plunged to less than half that value.

The abrupt changes have inspired comparisons to the dot-com bubble, and underscored the extremely speculative nature of investing in cryptocurrency.

By Wednesday, the price of bitcoin fell below $10,000 for the first time since Dec. 1, at one point dropping to less than $9,300 on one exchange (still significantly higher than the price just a few months ago). The price has risen back to around $12,000, but economists and investors are unsure how long it will stay there.

Some speculate the recent slide was due to fear over regulatory crackdowns on the cryptocurrency market.

Cryptocurrency trading hotbed South Korea has suggested a ban on trading might be possible, though the country has not yet finalized any plans. Similar reports recently circulated about China. The anxiety over anticipated crackdowns may have helped trigger a selloff across the cryptocurrency market Tuesday.

The largest and best-known of hundreds of digital currencies, bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is bought and sold in exchanges internationally.

""It's not based in dollars,"" Timothy Lee, a senior reporter at Ars Technica, told NPR's Scott Simon. ""Instead, it has its own currency, just called the bitcoin. And its value floats against other currencies the same way the dollar and the euro float against each other.""

""Bitcoin is based on a revolutionary technology. Users say it's got this very effective system for verifying transactions,"" NPR's Uri Berliner reports. ""And bitcoin believers point out that this currency's not tied to the whims of any government. And they say that's a good thing.""

But the recent price fall may not be a good thing for investors, who are still trying to figure out what the crash means for the future of the cryptocurrency. Many other digital currencies have shown similar swings in recent days.

In the wake of this week's crash, the top post in the Reddit forum /r/CryptoCurrency was about how to contact a suicide hotline, apparently a response to distress on the part of recent investors.

Some economists say this is a familiar pattern.

""Twenty years ago, the technology stocks and new Internet stocks achieved an excess valuation of $7 trillion because of speculation,"" said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors. ""The prices of shares were bid up to very high levels. When they collapsed, investors ... they got very hurt. We see similar characteristics in cryptocurrencies right now.""

Bitcoin investors know this trend as well.

Investors saw a similar rise and fall in bitcoin prices in December 2013. Bitcoin hit what was a record price of around $1,150 and fell by 40 percent just days later, after China announced that it was banning banks from trading the cryptocurrency.

And there have been dramatic rises and falls in the price of the cryptocurrency within the last year.

Early in 2017, bitcoin was valued around $900. It tripled its value within months — then, by the end of the year, tripled again.

""I think [cryptocurrencies] are highly speculative,"" Kotok said. ""Putting money into cryptocurrencies is a speculative thing to do. You might make a profit, but what we are seeing is people who — in the last month or two — put money into bitcoin, are having trouble getting cash back when they sell and are now watching the price fall and panicking.""

Some say that bitcoin shows promise. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund invested between $15 million and $20 million in the digital currency this month, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Economists aren't so sure. Some analysts believe that the cryptocurrency might be trying to find a temporary price floor, but Citigroup analysts think that the price of bitcoin could plummet again to half of its current value, CNBC reports.

On Dec. 9, Ars Technica's Lee had an uncertain prediction for the future of the cryptocurrency.

""I think it's going to continue to be volatile,"" Lee said. ""I think it will probably go up more, but I don't know how much more. And then I think it will probably crash. But I don't know how much — you know, how far down it will decline.""

Asia Simone Burns is an intern with NPR Digital News.",2018-01-18,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/bitcoin-ethereum-and-ripple-make-comeback-after-crypto-sell-off.html,"Major digital currencies edged higher on Thursday, after a two-day sell-off saw the world's biggest cryptocurrency bitcoin lose more than 50 percent from its December high. Bitcoin and ethereum — the first and second largest virtual currencies by market value — appeared to recover after Wednesday's lows. Bitcoin fell as low as $9,199.59 on Wednesday morning, but bounced back to $11,702.74 as of Thursday at 12:00 p.m. ET, according to CoinDesk, which tracks prices from cryptocurrency exchanges including Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Bitfinex. It was up 5 percent in the last 24 hours. The red-hot digital asset also broke the $12,000 level, hitting $12,045.10 at about 10:14 a.m. Ethereum on the other hand dived below the $800 mark to a three-week low of $780.92 Wednesday, but lifted to $1,072.57 the following day. It was more than 5 percent higher in the last 24 hours. Ripple's XRP, which is also known as ripple, surged 65 percent to $1.64 a coin, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The digital currency — which is controversial among crypto enthusiasts due the firm behind it being backed by big banks — fell as low as 90 cents the previous day.

Regulatory concerns

Experts told CNBC earlier this week that investors had been ""spooked"" by news of regulatory crackdowns from both South Korea and China. South Korea — one of the largest markets for cryptocurrencies — has reportedly been considering the shutdown of trading through cryptocurrency exchanges. On Thursday, the country's policymakers said they were considering closing all domestic virtual currency exchanges, echoing a move last year from Chinese regulators. China, separately, is reported to be deepening its clampdown of its digital currency market. According to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, the country is planning to ban the centralized trading of digital currencies.

""Trade volumes were very noisy yesterday as the bulls and bears fought it out and some sort of calm has appeared on the markets after what has been a severe correction,"" Charles Hayter, CEO of digital currency comparison site CryptoCompare, told CNBC in an email Thursday. ""New has a lot to play with this,"" Hayter said, adding, ""this market is now big and governments are sensing revenue for the coffers as well as a threat in some degrees. This will catalyze regulation where regimes who legislate severely will balkanise themselves to the industry."" Hayter said that regulation of cryptocurrencies ""will be good in the long run,"" but warned that ""unnecessary hoops and bureaucracy"" could inhibit the industry's potential.

Regulators have expressed concerns over digital assets due to their extremely volatile nature and worries that they could be used for illicit activity. Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, said: ""Now that the reasons for the recent sell-off are more clear to everyone and the slightly sour regulatory concerns have been priced in and the Asian premiums are evening out, traders will most likely start focusing on the technicals."" Greenspan told CNBC Tuesday that South Korean and Japanese investors often pay a premium of ""20 percent or more per coin."" Nolan Bauerle, director of research at CoinDesk, said that the sell-off was ""a feature of the global, liquid cryptocurrency trading environment."" ""When the price of bitcoin drops, there is a pattern of traders that move to take different positions, either in another cryptocurrency or in fiat,"" he told CNBC. ""These large drops, usually between the 25-40 percent range, generally find a bottom that is a consolidation of a previous all time high. When this bottom is found, the pattern continues with demand causing a new upward bounce."" Disclaimer: This story has been amended to reflect the fact that bitcoin lost more than 50 percent from its December high.

WATCH: Digital currency has real value — Here's why",2018-01-18,https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/01/18/146141/bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-a-hidden-power-structure-and-its-just-been-revealed/,"Perhaps the most striking finding is that the process of verifying transactions and securing a blockchain ledger against attack, called mining, is not actually that decentralized in either system. Bitcoin and Ethereum are open blockchain systems, meaning that in principle anyone can be a miner (see “What Bitcoin Is, and Why It Matters”). But organizations have formed to pool mining resources. The researchers found that the top four Bitcoin-mining operations had more than 53 percent of the system’s average mining capacity, measured on a weekly basis. Mining for Ethereum was even more consolidated: three miners accounted for 61 percent of the system’s average weekly capacity.

They also found that 56 percent of Bitcoin’s “nodes,” the computers around the world running its software (not all of them engage in mining), are located in data centers, versus 28 percent for Ethereum. That might indicate that Bitcoin is more corporatized, Sirer says. Overall, the group concluded that neither network “has strictly better properties than the other.”

Numbers like these may help clarify some debates. But the overall discussion of what “decentralization” means is much broader and more complicated. Hundreds of cryptocurrencies now exist, and many of them work differently from Bitcoin and Ethereum. Not all of them rely on miners or even use a blockchain.

There’s no perfect way to measure the decentralization of a cryptocurrency network, which is a complicated social as well as technical phenomenon. The way coins are distributed in a network can matter hugely, for example. In the case of Ripple, a privately owned company oversees the distribution of coins and still holds more than half of all in existence.

Discussions of decentralization may seem esoteric, but anyone interested in the future of cryptocurrency should try to follow along. Part of the vision sold by the technology’s biggest promoters is that it can help solve problems of financial inequality created in part by traditional, centralized institutions. If digital currency allows wealth and power to pool in the hands of a few, that’s not so revolutionary.",2018-01-18,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-backing-firms-feel-crypto-crash-pinch,"With Bitcoin shedding 50 percent of its value in little under a month, those firms who vocally rode the wave on the up are now feeling the terrify drop in terms of loss of their own market value.

Companies such as Overstock, which has some of its fortunes locked up in the digital currency, as well as Square Payments, which announced plans to allow for some Bitcoin buying and selling, have been hit hard by this crash.

Taking a beating

While the numbers being tracked by these Bitcoin-backing firms are nothing compared to the actual losses being suffered by the cryptocurrencies, they are directly correlated.

Square showed a loss of five percent or $90 mln, this week as the company which is led by Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey ended with a value of $15.1 bln.

Overstock, a longtime supporter of Bitcoin going back to 2014, fell 11 percent ending with a value of $1.8 bln thanks to the roughly $200 mln loss.

This latest drop in the crypto market has been put down to the uncertainty emanating from Korea with their apparent bank of cryptocurrencies on the cards. This pressure from regulators also adds teeth to the fears in dealing with cryptocurrencies in major firms.

Renaming regrets

There are also instances where companies who have tried to jump on the Bitcoin and Blockchain bandwagon have found that the wagon is currently in the shop for repairs.

A number of firms have changed their focus, tact or simply their name, to profit from the hype and mania around cryptocurrencies. However, the other, ugly, side to this ecosystem is the violent volatility that needs to be stomached.

Kodak, perhaps better known for their cameras, fell eight percent. The company has announced plans to offer a cryptocurrency known as KodakCoin at the end of the month, initially sending shares up 60 percent on the day of the announcement.

Shares of Riot Blockchain, once a biotech firm dubbed Bioptix, shed 17 percent Tuesday, even shares of Long Blockchain, once Long Island Iced Tea, shed two percent.

Lessons up for grabs

While the future, as it always is, is uncertain for the crypto ecosystem, there are lessons to be learned in this latest Bitcoin ‘death.’ Bitcoin has been dead and buried countless times as its volatile nature is too much for some to take, sending them fleeing.

However, it has shown stronger and stronger resistance and ability to bounce back over the years and the crashes. Something that companies that are facing unprecedented dips will need to be aware of.

The world’s largest dedicated semiconductor foundry, TSMC, expects that the bitcoin mining industry will continue to grow this year, fueling an increased demand for its chips. Some analysts now see the cryptocurrency mining sector as offering the highest potential to cover for weak iPhone X sales for Apple’s primary chip supplier.

Bitcoin X

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TPE: 2330) today reported its Q4 2017 earnings, showing a 10.1% increase in revenue and a 10.4% increase in net income. In total, the Q4 revenue was $9.21 billion, which increased 10.7% from the previous quarter and 11.6% year-over-year. The TSMC stock rose 2.69% in response.

“Our fourth quarter business was supported by major mobile product launches and continuing demand for cryptocurrency mining,” said Lora Ho, SVP and Chief Financial Officer of TSMC. “Moving into first quarter 2018, we expect the strong demand for cryptocurrency mining will continue while mobile product seasonality will dampen our business in this quarter.”

Bitcoin mining hardware is considered to offer the highest growth potential for the company with some analysts expecting that it will double and constitute up to 10% of TSMC’s revenues in 2018. They even hope it can compensate for the lackluster iPhone X sales in China for the chip maker. “The mining impact on TSMC is now akin to that of a popular new iPhone,” commented Mark Li, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “The difference is that each new iPhone requires a huge amount of innovation and marketing. The Bitcoin contribution is automatic.”

Boom or Bust

Stock analysts covering TSMC are divided about bitcoin’s long term effect on the company’s bottom line. “Although some investors are bullish that Bitcoin-related chipset demand could offset soft smartphone demand in 2018, we question whether Bitcoin demand will be sustainable” if prices slide, Benjamin Chiang, an analyst at KGI Securities, commented ahead of the results.

However, others acknowledge it can be a winning best for the company. “Cryptocurrency is like a call option for TSMC, which is an attractive investment on its own,” said Sebastian Hou, an analyst with CL Securities Taiwan Co. “If mining demand vanishes tomorrow, it shouldn’t affect the investment outlook. But if it turns out to be strong, the company will rake it in.”

PARIS (Reuters) - France and Germany will make joint proposals to regulate the bitcoin cryptocurrency at the next summit of the G20 group of major economies in Argentina in March, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday.

“We will have a joint Franco-German analysis of the risks linked to bitcoin, regulation proposals and these will be submitted as a joint proposal to our G20 counterparts at the G20 summit in Argentina in March,” Le Maire told reporters.

The world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has fallen to half its record peak of almost $20,000 in recent days on fears that regulators could seek to curb speculation.

“We have a responsibility towards our citizens to explain and reduce the risks,” Le Maire’s German counterpart Peter Altmaier said at the joint news conference in Paris.",2018-01-18 16:13:52+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/18/blockchain-wallet-launches-bitcoin-buy-and-sell-in-the-us.html,"Blockchain, one of the biggest cryptocurrency wallets in the world, launched a service to buy and sell digital coins in the U.S. on Thursday, in a challenge to Coinbase.

The U.K.-headquartered company already allows its British customers to buy and sell bitcoin via its service, and is now launching the function in one of the biggest cryptocurrency markets in the world.

From Thursday, Blockchain's U.S. users will be able to sell their bitcoin, with the buying function coming at a later date.

Many users in the U.S. have complained about services that offer cryptocurrency trading, citing issues around being able to withdraw money or get liquidity. Given that backdrop, Peter Smith, CEO of Blockchain, said it's better to start with just offering a sell service as it helps to control the launch in the U.S. and make sure people have a good experience.

""If we are prioritizing short-term gains, we would prioritize buy — that is what most people have done. But it's really time to make sure we nail that experience,"" Smith told CNBC in an interview ahead of the launch announcement.

The launch followed a huge sell-off in major cryptocurrencies that began Tuesday. The market appeared to stabilize on Thursday, however.

Blockchain claims to have 22 million users and Smith said that it has 1 million daily users. Thirty percent to 40 percent of those are in the U.S., Smith added. In comparison, Coinbase, which has seen a surge in sign-ups to its platform in recent months, has over 10 million users, according to its website. Coinbase allows people to buy and sell bitcoin, ethereum and bitcoin cash.

Smith said that ""in a few weeks"" Blockchain will add other cryptocurrencies to its platform to buy and sell.

Cryptocurrencies have divided opinion among business leaders and experts. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon famously called bitcoin a ""fraud"", while noted investor Warren Buffett told CNBC that cryptocurrencies will ""come to a bad ending.""

But others have said bitcoin will continue to climb this year. Julian Hosp, co-founder of TenX, a firm that wants to make it easier for people to spend virtual currencies, told CNBC in December that bitcoin could hit $60,000 in 2018, but could crash first. And Dave Chapman, managing director of cryptocurrency trading firm Octagon Strategy, said that bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018.

Blockchain's Smith did not give a price call on bitcoin, but said that it's likely the cryptocurrency's dominance, which is already on the decline, could continue to fall.

""What could happen this year is that I think we will see the dominance of bitcoin as a percentage of the market capitalization go down. That could be because other digital coins get strong, or that there are a lot more that are interesting,"" he said.",2018-01-18,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-govt-officials-accused-of-crypto-insider-trading,"The past week of confusion and friction over cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea continues to unfold as accusations surface of government officials practicing insider trading, local news source Chosun reports.

According to the local reports on Thursday, Jan. 18, some government officials from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), who were aware of forthcoming announcements about either a full ban or significant restrictions on trading, bought and sold cryptocurrency just before that information went public.

FSS chief Choi Hyung-sik confirmed the suspicions in a meeting Thursday, admitting:

“We have confirmed the intelligence. We have confirmed that some public officials have done such an act”

The allegations of activity tantamount to corruption further weakens Seoul's position after its highly-unpopular and contradictory announcements on cryptocurrency regulation caused mass public outcry.

A public petition calling for a reversal of the restrictions as well as the firing of some high-profile ministers has now attracted more than 200,000 signatures, meaning it requires a government response within 30 days.

Meanwhile, the legality of any insider crypto trading based on classified knowledge is not clear at the moment. Ironically, cryptocurrency’s undefined legal status means the practice cannot be treated as trading involving fully-regulated instruments.

A FSS official stated:

“There is no code of ethics and no code of conduct for virtual currency investment in FSS regulations, so it’s difficult to say about punishment at this stage.”

Chosun also points out that the officials could be accused not of insider trading, but more generally of “the misuse of internal information.”",,,,

We’ve been been hearing buzzwords like “Bitcoin,” “Ethereum,” and “Coin Exchange” floating around in the news. That’s because the world of cryptocurrency has started to take off and is gaining national attention. You may feel left out because you don’t understand this trend. Don’t worry, this complete beginner’s guide will teach you everything you know.

What Is A Cryptocurrency?

According to Cryptominded, a curated directory of cryptocurrency resources, “Cryptocurrencies have been around for over eight years, and they currently have a market value of around $170 billion.”

Simply put, cryptocurrency is money in digital form that utilizes computer cryptography to secure transactions. It’s almost like digital cash.

Cryptocurrencies are revolutionizing the way we do financial transactions. Here’s the big kick: Cryptocurrency allows for seamless, direct transactions between parties without needing the validation of a central authority.

It used to be that external parties such as banks had to validate each transaction you made. You gave them your information, and they, in turn, managed and kept track of your transactions. Instead, cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for a “middle man,” per se. As the owner of your cryptocurrency, you have control of all payments without a central authority watching.

How Does Cryptocurrency Work, And Can I Trust It?

Cryptocurrency runs on what’s called a blockchain. What’s a blockchain, you ask? A blockchain is a ledger that stores transactions in a log, just like a normal accounting ledger. Its name comes from the fact that it stores groups of transactions that happened in a similar time frame in a “block.”

Each block is eventually added to a chain with other blocks of transactions that took place at other points in time, which gives it the name “blockchain.”

The security of the blockchain is maintained by computer cryptography, which is where the “crypto” in cryptocurrency comes from. It’s important to know that blockchains are public, so every transaction that’s logged in its ledger is visible to anyone forever. Blockchains are also immutable, so nobody can ever change the contents of the ledger. Once a transaction is confirmed, it’s set in stone.

Security is of utmost importance when handling money, and, since cryptocurrencies let you be the full owner of your money, it’s your responsibility to make sure your money is safe at all times. But, there’s no need to worry: Blockchains are naturally secure there, and there are many measures in place to make sure your money is secure and in your hands. So, you can rest assured that it’s improbable for someone to tamper with it.

When you have cryptocurrency, money is stored in your own personal wallet. A wallet consists of two main components: a private key and an address. Each wallet is secured by its unique private key, which is a secret string of letters and numbers only accessible to the owner. You can use a wallet to create transactions and send people money, or you can use it to receive money from others.

Which Currencies Are The Most Popular?

Today there are thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence, but for the purpose of this guide, we’ll focus on the most popular three.

Bitcoin (symbol BTC) has the No. 1 spot by far. It’s the first cryptocurrency to exist and has the greatest market capitalization at $16.7 billion, which makes it the most valuable cryptocurrency at the moment. The creator of Bitcoin is unknown, however. The inventor goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. While the name may suggest the creator is a Japanese man, many speculators believe Satoshi Nakamoto is the name for a group of people.

Litecoin (symbol LTC) is another popular cryptocurrency. Created by MIT grad and former Google engineer Charlie Lee, Litecoin is often called “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold” because of its close relation to Bitcoin. Investopedia describes Litecoin and cites, “…it has a faster block generation rate and hence offers a faster transaction confirmation.”

Another popular coin is Ethereum (symbol ETH). Ethereum adds more functionality to its blockchain ledger by supporting smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of computer code that run on the entire Ethereum network all at once, which lets Ethereum act like a “global computer.” Members of the Ethereum team say the technology can be used to, “codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about everything.”

Ethereum was created by 19-year old, Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin. He launched Ethereum in 2015, making it a very young project. A little-known fact about Ethereum is that, unlike many other cryptocurrencies, its basic unit of currency doesn’t have the same name as the technology: The currency in Ethereum is called Ether.

OK, Now That I Know The Basics, How Can I Get Involved?

This new industry is very lucrative, even for teens.

Take 16-year-old Eddy Zillman for example. This Ohio teen started trading with money he received from his bar mitzvah and, after some hard work, he now has his own cryptocurrency consulting business and has “made close to a million from trades.”

The first step is to buy coins. One of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges is Coinbase, and their service also doubles as a wallet to store the coins you buy. Through exchanges like Coinbase, you can buy and sell a handful of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. To make money, you must buy at low prices and sell when the prices go higher than you bought the coins for. Although this sounds easy at first, keep in mind that cryptocurrencies have notoriously volatile, unpredictable changes in price.

Kraken is another well-known exchange platform founded in July 2011 by Jesse Powell. It’s a San Francisco-based company that boasts being “the largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity and also trading Canadian dollars, US dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen.” The company goes on to say that they have been rated the most secure Bitcoin exchange.

Gemini is still relatively new, founded in 2015 by the Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron. These two gained popularity when they alleged Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea of Facebook from them. Gemini is renowned for being the world’s first licensed ether exchange. Gemini allows people to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ether.

This All Sounds Good, But What Are The Drawbacks?

Perhaps the largest disadvantage of cryptocurrency is that it is not widely accepted for use in day-to-day transactions. As of now, there are few websites that accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment. In fact, cryptocurrency has yet to be legalized in many countries.

Another disadvantage of using cryptocurrency is that you can potentially lose your wallet. You can have money stored in a digital wallet on your phone or on your computer; however, it is adamant that you keep your password for those devices. If you can’t access your wallet, you can no longer access your digital currency. To continue, digital currencies have no reverse payment guarantee.

That is to say, that if you mistakenly pay someone using cryptocurrency, there is no way to undo it. Your only option is to request a refund. Keep in mind that the person can refuse the refund and your money is will not be returned.

Lastly, like all things digital, cryptocurrency is prone to attacks. In reality, this is something that can’t be avoided. Many exchanges are prone to DDos attacks. Don’t let that deter you — there are many ways you can keep your wallet safe, just do a little research. Try keeping some wallets offline in a method called cold storage.

A safe approach to get involved in cryptocurrencies is to buy at any price and hold your purchases for extremely long periods of time (maybe even never sell). Cryptocurrency experts call this act “HODLing.” If you’re just started out, hodling coins if your best option because it gives you time learn the market and get your feet wet in a secure way.

Whew! That Was A Lot!

Cryptocurrencies are relatively new and can even be a little intimidating, but be proud yourself for learning more. Use this information as a starting point and learn some more on your own. Teach your friends, too! Digital currency can be a very lucrative market.

So it should come as no surprise that there are now two exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, focused on blockchain technology, the digital ledger that keeps records of transactions in virtual currencies.

The Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy (BLCN) and Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) ETFs both launched this week. ETFs can be bought and sold like stocks, and these two each own shares of the increasing number of companies that use blockchain.

But note that the words bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain are not in the names of these funds.

That's intentional, according to the CEOs of Reality Shares and Amplify ETFs.

Both told CNNMoney that the SEC was worried because some stocks have skyrocketed lately simply because they said that they were using blockchain technology.

Riot Blockchain (RIOT) used to be a biotech firm. Long Blockchain (LBCC) is the company formerly known as Long Island Iced Tea Co. And Kodak (KODK) just launched its own KodakCoin cryptocurrency.

""Investors have been buying blindly, and there has been some abuse,"" said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs. ""The SEC has to protect investors.""

But make no mistake. These two funds are set up to take advantage of the growing interest in blockchain.

This is not the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, a fund that only owns bitcoin and is run by Cameron and Tyler, of Facebook and ""The Social Network"" movie fame. The Winklevii want to launch an ETF with the ticker symbol COIN, but the SEC has yet to approve it.

In fact, the SEC seems unlikely to greenlight any funds that just want to invest in cryptocurrencies. Dalia Blass, director of the SEC's Division of Investment Management, wrote in a letter Thursday that it had many questions about these funds.

And she said that until they are addressed, ""we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products.""

That edict does not apply to the new blockchain funds, though. Those ETFs don't own any bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, ripple or any of the other numerous cyrptocurrencies out there. Instead, they are buying shares of companies that are embracing blockchain.

Both funds own Overstock (OSTK), the online retailer, which has made a big push into blockchain through its Medici Ventures unit and tZero digital coin exchange.

They also own IBM (IBM), which recently partnered with shipping giant Maersk to track and manage supply chains using blockchain technology. Intel (INTC), whose chips and software are used to encrypt cryptocurrency transactions, is a top holding in both ETFs, too.

Each is betting on financial firms that could benefit from blockchain. The Reality Shares fund owns shares of Nasdaq (NDAQ) and Barclays (BCS) for example while the Amplify fund has stakes in Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS).

But there are some key differences between the two ETFs. Reality Shares is based on an index of blockchain-related companies that it recently launched with Nasdaq. That index -- and hence, the fund's holdings -- are rebalanced twice a year.

The Amplify ETF, on the other hand, is actively managed and free to make changes to its holdings more frequently.

Related: Why everyone is talking about Ripple

Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares, said his firm's ETF is taking a rigorous look at just how much exposure to the blockchain business a company has before adding it to the index and fund.

""We're not going to accept Kodak just because it's suddenly decided to do something with blockchain,"" Ervin said.

He said the company also doesn't own MoneyGram (MGI) in the fund, despite a recent partnership with Ripple, or Jack Dorsey's Square (SQ), which is letting people buy and sell bitcoin on its Cash app.

But Amplify's Magoon said his fund has bought a small stake in Kodak. And Square is a top-10 position in the fund. Still, he's wary of smaller companies trying to ride the blockchain and bitcoin wave. ""We don't want scam stocks,"" he said.

So far, each of the ETFs is up a bit in its first few days of trading. But neither has exploded like bitcoin often has.

And Magoon said that's just fine with him.

""Bitcoin needs blockchain, but blockchain doesn't need bitcoin,"" he said. ""The crash in cryptocurrencies is good and healthy.""",2018-01-19,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-bitcoin-india-taxes/india-sends-tax-notices-to-cryptocurrency-investors-as-trading-hits-3-5-billion-idUSKBN1F8190,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has sent tax notices to tens of thousands of people dealing in cryptocurrency after a nationwide survey showed more than $3.5 billion worth of transactions have been conducted over a 17-month period, the income tax department said.

Tech-savvy young investors, real estate players and jewelers are among those invested in bitcoin and other virtual currencies, tax officials told Reuters after gathering data from nine exchanges in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Pune.

Governments around the world are grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrency trading, and policymakers are expected to discuss the matter at a G20 summit in Argentina in March.

The Indian government has issued repeated warnings against digital currency investments, saying these were like “Ponzi schemes” that offer unusually high returns to early investors.

But it has not so far imposed curbs on an industry estimated to be adding 200,000 users in India every month.

B.R. Balakrishnan, a director general of investigations at the income tax department in the southern state of Karnataka, said notices were sent following the survey to assess the penetration and patterns of virtual currency trade.

“We cannot turn a blind eye. It would have been disastrous to wait until the final verdict was out on its legality,” he told Reuters.

The tax department has asked people dealing in bitcoin and other virtual currencies such as ethereum and ripple to pay tax on capital gains. They have also asked for details about their total holdings and the source of funds in the tax notice seen by Reuters.

“We found that investors were not reflecting it on their tax returns and in many cases, the investment was not accounted for,” Balakrishnan said.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, soared more than 1,700 percent last year, hitting a record high just shy of $20,000 as institutional and retail investors around the world snapped up the virtual currency.

Its huge gains have attracted the attention of global regulators tasked with protecting investors from fraud.

In recent weeks, Japan and China have made noises about a regulatory crackdown, while South Korean policymakers said they were considering shutting down domestic virtual currency exchanges.

REGULATION

An Indian finance ministry official said a federal committee was looking into the possibility of imposing restrictions on virtual currencies and that eventually parliament would have to legislate a regulatory regime.

Officials at Zebpay, India’s leading bitcoin exchange, said the industry was adding near 200,000 users every month with an estimated trade volume of about 20 billion Indian rupees ($315 million).

“Many of our customers are treating digital currency like gold,” said Zebpay co-founder Saurabh Agarwal.

Aman Kalra, marketing head of Coinsecure, a bitcoin exchange in New Delhi, said more than 150 bitcoins were changing hands every week through its platform. The company has 100,000 registered users and is now launching a platform to sell ethereum and other digital currencies.

“I don’t think anyone in the government should label our business as a ‘Ponzi scheme’, we are not doing anything illegal,” said Kalra.

Tax inspectors said they sought help from experts in blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, to conduct the survey.

In some cases, tax officials themselves participated in the trade to identify loopholes after they found investors had poured in billions of dollars through unregulated exchanges.

The biggest worry for New Delhi, the finance ministry official said, was how to protect investors trading on offshore exchanges.

Already hundreds of investors have gone to the police and courts with complaints of transactions in virtual currencies that turned out to be fraudulent, said Pavan Duggal, a Supreme Court lawyer specializing in cybercrimes.

“Considering cryptocurrencies are here to stay, the government must consider granting limited legality while ensuring that these are not used for crypto crimes,” he said.

The probe started after the central bank on Dec. 7, 2017 issued a regulation banning the use of cryptocurrencies in payment systems, said Causa Iman Karana, head of Bank Indonesia’s representative office in Bali.

“We found out from some postings on social media that Bali appeared to have become a haven for bitcoin transactions,” said Karana.

Central bank officials and police went undercover at the end of 2017 to investigate scores of businesses in Bali advertising online that they offered bitcoin payment services, said Karana.

The team found two cafes still using bitcoin as a means of payment, but 44 businesses including car rental outlets, hotels, travel companies and jewelry stores, previously offering the service, had now stopped, he said.

One of the cafes used bitcoin only for transactions of more than 243,000 rupiah, or about 0.001 bitcoin. A single transaction took about 1 1/2 hours to be processed and included a fee of 123,000 rupiah so this had discouraged its wider use for payments, said Karana.

The official declined to name the businesses because he was still waiting for further instructions from Bank Indonesia in Jakarta.

“The next step is we will ban them as mandated by the law. We ask them not to use it anymore. Along with the Directorate of Special Crime Investigation unit, we will enforce the rule that all transactions in Indonesia must use rupiah.”

Some locals in Bali said bitcoin was being used mainly by foreigners on the island, which is Indonesia’s tourism hub and has a large expatriate community.

Bank Indonesia has called ownership of virtual currencies high risk and prone to speculation, because no authority takes responsibility or officially administers them and because there is no underlying asset to be the basis for the price.

Virtual currencies could also be used in money laundering and terrorism funding, and could have an impact on the stability of the financial system and causes losses for society, it has said.

While trading has not be regulated so far, the central bank has said it was looking into the issue.

Regulators around the world have been grappling with how to address risks posed by cryptocurrencies, as bitcoin, the world’s most popular virtual currency, soared more than 1,700 percent last year.

Prices have plummeted since South Korea said last week it may ban domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.

Bitcoin.co.id, an Indonesian online cryptocurrency exchange, said on its website that bitcoin was trading at 162.70 million rupiah ($12,247) per unit after losing around a quarter of it value this week.

Banks make money from cryptocurrency exchanges by charging them approximately 200 to 300 won per customer deposit, the news outlet detailed, adding that crypto traders pay higher commissions to the exchanges when withdrawing funds.

According to the FSS, the Industrial Bank of Korea earned the most from virtual account services last year. The bank provides these services to Upbit, which has recently become the world’s largest exchange by volume. Upbit is backed by Kakao Corp, the operator of South Korea’s most popular chat app, Kakao Talk. The bank “earned a total of 675 million won by setting a virtual account fee of 300 won per deposit,” the publication conveyed.

The bank with the second highest commission income from crypto-related services is Nonghyup Bank which provides virtual account services to Bithumb and Coinone. The bank earned 654 million won from these services last year.

Shinhan Bank provides virtual account services to a few crypto exchanges including Bithumb and Korbit, bringing it 621 million won last year. Kookmin Bank made 155 million won, the Korea Development Bank made 61 million won, and Woori Bank earned 59 million won from crypto exchanges last year.

Currently, the South Korean government has mandated banks to stop issuing new virtual accounts until they have installed the new a real-name identification system. Banks will also be required to check the purpose of trading and the source of funds for each crypto account holder.

It is known, the investment process can eventually be destroyed by the initial coin offering (ICO) or ensuing token generation events. The new business model existing it the world of blockchain technology changes traditional fundraising campaigns in the way of clarity, transparent success and safety. Producing of the held-for-trading tokens raises the capital in this process.

The peculiarity of ICO is founded on the idea of using the crypto tokens. The main two tokens types proving the services and products of ICO to the potential investors are the utility tokens (app coins) and equity tokens. In case of business success, the investors are able to get the money in cash or different coins in exchanges (e.g. ETH, BTC) by trading on the basic cryptocurrency exchanges. The adventurous for an ICO is the perspective of capital growth that can provide further development of the project based on the blockchain.

ICO INVESTING COULD BE THE BEST WAY TO GROW RICH

Throughout 2017 ICO became the most commercially successful and investment attractive way to get the capital for starting the business. Such ICO niches like gambling, finance, healthcare, E-learning are in great demand with investors.

As was said earlier, the substitution of traditional business models for new ones in the world of blockchain technologies brings advanced ways for project development, its fundraising, and realization. First of all, it is evenly necessary to spend the time on learning the rock-solid whitepaper and well-crafted website if the investor is interested in ICO investing. Full knowing of core ICO audience and the idea of ICO are also essential for starting investment.

A GRAIN OF SAND ON THE BEACH

The advent of plenty ICOs and new tokens with every week, the realization of them and understanding of possible sustained profit is like looking for a grain in the beach. That is why new investors should be aware of the main rules and regulations of ICO’s country. The investors have better chance to differentiate ICOs with wealth potential from scams if they fully understand the business environment.

Generally speaking, ICOs always try finding the right solution of the problem regarding startup based on the blockchain. The secret of success lies in understanding the ICOs market subtle aspects, the suggestions, and provided solutions.

THE DIFFERENT WAYS FOR SPORTS BETTING

After lots of tries to develop the newest blockchain PokerStars website, sports betting remained an untouched ICO sub-niche in the gambling industry. It is natural that players need the favorable and secure environment as much as the investors need the tidy gambling income. The ICO’s model simplifies the betting process and fundamentally changes the common gambling industry.

XWIN – THE SPORTS BETTING SAFE PLATFORM BASED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN

XWIN is the betting sharing Ethereum platform based on the blockchain. The development of the crypto-bookmaker platform is the primary XWIN goal. Using the Ethereum smart contracts to ensure the transparency of transactions, XWIN breaks the online bookmaking industry and provides a comfortable environment for gaining income out of gambling for both investors and players.

The XWIN investors get 20 percent commission out of company’s profit margin. The 24/7 investment supervision, safe transactions, privacy policy, sustainability are included as additional perks.

The XWIN business model with margins from six to twenty percent per bet has promising income prospects. The funds are meant to be used for players’ and investors’ awarding as well as development and farther improvement of XWIN platform.

Disposition of funds:

25% guaranteed payments for players

20% maintenance and managing defrayment

35% promotion, PR, and advertising, online/offline marketing

20% amount distributed among investors

The campaign of XWIN tokens open sale will come to the end on Jan.30, 2018. The Pre-ICO reached the deadline on Dec.31, 2017 and entered the ICO phase that started on Jan.1 up to Jan.30,2018. The value of one XWIN is 0.004 ETH. XWIN tokens are already available to grab.

The crash left people penniless (Illustration: Getty images)

Cryptocurrency investors are claiming to have lost their life savings in a devastating crash which saw a £200 virtual coin become almost worthless overnight.

On Tuesday this week, the British firm behind a cryptocurrency called Bitconnect (BCC) announced that it was closing down its lending and exchange platform.

Despite promises to list BCC on other exchanges so trading could continue, the news sent the market into freefall.

The coin launched at the beginning of last year and went from being worth less than a cent to being valued at more than $400 (£287), with the total BCC market worth about $2.7 billion (£1.9 billion).

It was promoted by a bizarre and hilarious video showing a bald man called Carlos excitedly ranting about how much money he’s made.

The film features clapping and whooping but does not contain shots of an actual audience.

Bitconnect has been dogged by claims that it’s a Ponzi Scheme – the name for a type of scam practised by Bernie Madoff in which con artists pays old investors a return generated by cash pledged by new investors.

Both Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin and Litecoin founder Charlie Lee slammed the cryptocurrency form in reply to a tweet by an ex-hedge fund manager called Michael Novagratz, which you can read below.

Bitconnect said this criticism ‘made community members uneasy and created a lack of confidence in the platform’ in a statement announcing the closure of its lending and exchange platform, which allowed people to borrow and trade BCC.

The firm has also received cease and desist letters from the Texas State Securities Board and the North Carolina Secretary of State Securities Division.

BitConnect really seems like a scam. an old school ponzi … bad actors hurt the community. period. #bitcoin #ether — Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) November 30, 2017

Anyone who doesn't yet agree with this should watch this video:https://t.co/mA2NxKlSQN https://t.co/k2YJvWMnzE — Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) December 1, 2017

I've been asked what I think about BitConnect. From the surface, seems like a classic ponzi scheme. I wouldn't invest in it and wouldn't recommend anyone else to. I follow this rule of thumb: ""If it looks like a ?, walks like a ?, and quacks like a ?, then it's a ponzi."" ? — Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite) November 30, 2017

In a statement, the firm vowed to make sure investors got their cash.

‘We are closing the lending operation immediately with the release of all outstanding loans,’ it wrote.

‘With release of your entire active loan in the lending wallet we are transferring all your lending wallet balance to your BitConnect wallet balance at $363.62.

‘This rate has been calculated based on last 15 days averages of the closing price registered on coinmarketcap.com.’

But this promise was not enough to stop investors losing faith in Bitconnect altogether.

Its price has been on the slide for months, but on Tuesday it plunged from a high of about $330 (£237) to just over $20, before slumping to a dismal low of $5 the next day.

There have been three companies called Bitconnect set up in the UK.

It is not known if there are any links between these companies and the names of each firm’s directors are totally different. We have decided not to publish any of the directors’ names.

In November 2017, Companies House launched the first stage of a process to strike off a firm called Bitconnect Ltd. from Britain’s Registrar of Companies.

Another is called Bitconnect Trading and is run by a man who also operates a Bitcoin mining business.

A total of 14 directors are named in a Companies House filing about a third firm called Bitconnect International Plc.

One of the directors is a ‘life success consultant’ on a mission to help people ‘rely on and believe in your unlimited potential and power’. When we phoned the number on this man’s website, he did not answer.

The other directors are mostly based in London, although they appear to hail from a number of countries from around the world including India and Vietnam.

On Reddit, a man with the name Litecoin whose posting history indicated he is a serious cryptocurrency trader, claimed to have lost his life savings in the crash.

The unfortunate investor said he took out a business loan of $500,000 and has now lost it all.

He wrote: ‘I planned to withdraw within a month or two. Now I cant access the funds to sell and the market crashed, I cannot pay for the business, my family needs the funds, I need help.

‘This is the worst day.’

This is a ‘copy pasta’ – the name for a piece of text which is repeatedly replicated like a meme – posted in response to the crash (Picture: Reddit)

Another person raged: ‘This is all a bad joke right?

‘I’m ruined. Like really fucking ruined. I have nothing left. I put everything I had into this because I trusted them.

‘Literally all of my family’s savings are in Bitconnect, because a friend told me the risk was worth it.

‘Are you telling me I lost everything? $80,000 gone like nothing?’

On a Reddit forum dedicated to the discussion of Bitconnect, one person published the number of a suicide charity whilst others made the astonishing (and probably untrue) claim that crime syndicates were now looking to exact revenge on the people who launched the cryptocurrency.

Remarkably, the price of Bitconnect has started to buoy up after its Twitter account promised that the currency would regain its value.

As well as a cryptocurrency, Bitconnect runs a website which publishes cryptocurrency news. This has been updated since the crash, suggesting the company is planning to continue operations.

At this time, we are closing the lending platform only. The BCC Exchange will work as usual and the wallet service will remain operational to hold your BCC on the website.@bitconnect @hitbtc @CoinExchangeio @livecoin_net @CoinMarketCap — BitConnect (@bitconnect) January 18, 2018

We still expect BitConnect coin (BCC) to gain its value back and you can hold your coins in the website wallet or transfer them to a QT wallet. We are still supporting BCC to gain its value back. @bitconnect — BitConnect (@bitconnect) January 18, 2018

The crypto-firm said it was only closing the lending platform and its exchange is still working so people can trade their coins.

It wrote: ‘We are still supporting BCC to gain its value back.’

This apparently positive development tripled the price Bitconnect to roughly $33.

The shocking claim from a cybersecurity expert was made public after slides from her presentation in Russia were photographed and shared on social media. One of Natalya Kaspersky’s slides said: ""Bitcoin is a project of American intelligence agencies, which was designed to provide quick funding for US, British and Canadian intelligence activities in different countries. “The technology is 'privatised,' just like the Internet, GPS and TOR. In fact, it is dollar 2.0. Its rate is controlled by the owners of exchanges.”

The slides were photographed during Ms Kaspersky’s talk at ITMP University in St Petersburg. In the talk she also claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto, who is credited with creating the currency, was in fact the codename for a collective of US cryptographers. During the presentation she also shared her theory that your smartphone is not a personal device and is instead used to spy on its owner. The theory comes after it was claimed that the recent cryptocurrney crash was good for bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not going away but it is facing major competition from other cryptocurrencies like Ripple and Monero, Spencer Bogart from Blockchain Capital said. Speaking to CNBC, he said: “I think now in 2018 we have a lot of people that recognise that bitcoin is not going away. “But we have to go back and if we rewind to 2014 when bitcoin came off its highs of $1000 and started declining back to 300, we had the bust of the Silk Road and Mt. Gox.

Well – at least for those who have powerful computers and know how to mine Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies, that is.

Although one has to make a considerable investment in equipment and make a risky bet on the value of a virtual currency that is not backed by any government, ever more Ukrainians are entering the business.

With powerful hardware, one can easily earn about $2,000 a month – quite an income in Ukraine, where the average monthly wage is $250.

How it works

Mining Bitcoins means using a computer to help maintain a distributed ledger of Bitcoin transactions recorded in what is called a blockchain – groups of transactions are recorded in blocks, and blocks are in turn linked to each other to form a chain. This data representation makes it very difficult (practically impossible) to falsify transaction records.

But the creators of the Bitcoin software also made it very difficult to verify transactions, hence the need to have a powerful computer on hand. The reward for helping maintain the Bitcoin ledger is the issue of more Bitcoins (later it will be transaction fees).

The value of this currency has risen from nothing to more than $11,000 over the nine years of its existence.

However, the way the system is set up, it gets harder and harder to mine Bitcoins. It happens because the difficulty of the calculations required to verify a transactions rises in line with the available computing power, which the system measures every two weeks. As a result, Bitcoins continue to be issued at the same rate even though much more computer power is dedicated to the job.

Moreover, only a finite number of Bitcoins, 21 million, will ever be issued. As of January, 16.8 million Bitcoins were in circulation. But with mining becoming more complicated, it is projected that the last Bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140.

Meanwhile, according to Google Trends, “Bitcoin” was the second most popular search worldwide in Google News in 2017, beaten only by “hurricane Irma.”

Meet the miners

One of those trying to cash in on mining Bitcoins (traded as BTC) is Odesa businessman Ivan Sydorenko. His computers, kept in a datacenter of a Kyiv friend, bring him about $50 every day.

In the summer of 2017, Sydorenko invested $6,000 to buy the mining hardware, and has already returned his money. Now he plans to buy at least $12,000 more worth of equipment to boost his profits.

“Anyway, I’ve mined much more than that sum ($12,000) over the last six months,” Sydorenko said, adding that it happened because the price of a Bitcoin grew six times over the period. Indeed, over the last year the value of Bitcoin has grown exponentially, from $800 to $13,000.

Aleksandr Bortnikov, the head of the design agency Rhombus, earns about $60 per day from mining cryptocurrency, but he pays a percentage to the company that hosts his hardware and maintains it for him.

The designer saw the cryptocurrency market as a yet another way “to diversify his investments.”

In summer 2017 he invested $10,000 in equipment, and the money was quickly returned by mining the cryptocurrency Ethereum (traded as ETH). Ethereum’s value has risen from $200 in August to $1,200 now.

The datacenter Bortnikov trusted his initial investment with was MiningNetUa. It helped him to choose hardware, set it up, and maintain it.

Photo by Mining.Net.Ua Mining service providers usually allocate hardware to cool data centers, maintain them, and report the results of mining to the people who use their services. Prev 01 3 Next

Real world

Bortnikov is still mining cryptocurrency, earning about $1,800 a month. But his income is likely to fall, as the math tasks that his computers have to solve are getting harder, and he would have to invest in more computing power to maintain his profits.

He doesn’t plan to, however.

“I’d have to re-invest if I wanted to stay in this, but I’ve got a real-world business and I’ll direct my money to it instead,” Bortnikov said.

As Bortnikov plans to quit MiningNetUa, its CEO Raphael Nersesyan says his job is to make sure everything keeps working for his other 1,000 clients.

“We mine, and the person who invests just gets the money. They can do whatever they want – travel, work – we’ll make sure the mining happens,” Nersesyan told the Kyiv Post. He owns four datacenters, and his company works with people from different countries.

“Basically, they get their money and do nothing,” he said.

On average, people invest $25,000 in hardware to start mining cryptocurrency, according to Nersesyan, but some “believe in cryptocurrency so much that they are ready to put millions of dollars into this industry.”

Trading up

Not all miners are as open as Bortnikov and Sydorenko about their earnings. Artem Pokutnii, 25, a freelance programmer, would only say that he spent $1,000 on equipment, and he recovered his investment in less than two months.

“This was something new four years ago: coins and algorithms – it was interesting to understand how it works,” Pokutnii told the Kyiv Post.

But recently he stopped mining. Today, Pokutnii sees more promise in trading cryptocurrencies on an exchange, as the volatility of the digital currencies is something traders can play on. For instance, those who bought Bitcoins last January have seen their value grow by 16 times.

“It’s more profitable to buy cryptocurrencies and trade them than mine them, and that’s exactly what I’m doing,” Pokutnii said.

Is it legal?

Ukraine has no laws that regulate cryptocurrency. So in the opinion of Artem Afian, a managing partner of law firm Juscutum, mining, using and trading cryptocurrencies is legal in Ukraine.

“It’s legal to do vacuum cleaning naked, to dance salsa, and to mine cryptocurrency,” Afian told the Kyiv Post. “If a particular activity is not forbidden, then it’s allowed.”

If authorities come to a house of a miner and claim otherwise, Afian urges them to go to court and to demand justice.

All the same, the National Bank of Ukraine, Ukraine’s central bank, does not approve of cryptocurrencies, describing them as “money surrogates.”

The ability to use the money anonymously also worries law enforcers as well as regulators: National Security and Defense Council Head Oleksandr Turchynov said that cryptocurrencies could be used to legalize criminal assets, to pay for prohibited goods like drugs and weapons, and finance terrorism.

On Jan. 11, Turchynov urged law enforcers to create a mechanism for monitoring transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges and to disclose customer information at request.

This can prove hard to do. Nowhere in the world have there been any cases of the anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions being broken.

Watchful eyes

While cryptocurrencies promise fast profits, keep all the parties anonymous, and are not regulated by the Ukrainian government, the country’s law enforcement agencies are keeping a close eye on developments in this area.

This attention has resulted in police searches, one of which happened to Anatoly Kaplan, the editor of ForkLog, one of the top publications on the cryptocurrency industry. He’s a Russian citizen who’s been living in Ukraine for five years.

Ukraine’s Security Service, or SBU, accuses Kaplan of money laundering and transferring them to Russia using cryptocurrencies. However, the warrant stated a different reason for the search: illegal forgery of U.S. bank cards and accepting payment in cryptocurrency.

The SBU arrived to Kaplan’s house with this warrant in December, and gained access to Kaplan’s computers and online wallets. The journalist claims the SBU illegally seized cryptocurrencies worth $800,000, transferring the money to their accounts. Another $500,000 worth of his cryptocurrencies was frozen, he said.

“Such groundless searches are common practice (in Ukraine and Russia),” Kaplan told the Kyiv Post via the online messenger app Telegram. He doesn’t have a Ukrainian cell number anymore, because he thinks the police wiretapped him.

Kaplan is sure the search was extortion, pure and simple.

“The SBU looks for spheres that are financially interesting to them. I assume they wanted a bribe from me,” Kaplan said. “My Russian passport just played the role of a red rag in this case.”

SBU spokeswoman Olena Hitlyanska told the Kyiv Post she was not able to give comments further to the SBU’s official statement on the case. As of the time of publication, the SBU has not responded to a Kyiv Post media request for information on this case.

Kaplan said he wanted to bring the case to the European Court of Human Rights and sue the government of Ukraine for the return of his $1.3 million in frozen and seized cryptocurrency.

“I’m sure I’ll win. There are many similar cases that are successful, against Russia and other governments in which the law enforcement systems work against people,” Kaplan said. “Such parasitism of the authorities on the cryptocurrency market destroys the reputation of Ukraine. Billions of dollars will leave Ukraine, or won’t come here.”

The Canadian government has launched a trial to explore the use of blockchain technology in making government research grant and funding information more transparent to the public.

For the trial, the National Research Council (NRC) is using the Catena Blockchain Suite, a Canadian-made product built on the Ethereum blockchain, to publish funding and grant information in real time.

When the NRC creates or amends a grant, the pertinent information is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, and posted on an online database that Canadians can peruse.

“Blockchains provide the ultimate in transparency and trust, making this technology a brave new world for organizations that strive to conduct transparent business,” the NRC said in a blog post.

“These are early days yet, but the experiment is expected to provide constructive insight into the potential for blockchain technology and how it may be used for more open and transparent function of public programs.”

What is the Ethereum blockchain?

As the NRC website explains, “On the simplest level, blockchains are public ledgers that record transactions shared among many users. Once data is entered on a blockchain, it is secure and unalterable, and provides a permanent record.”

The high level of security comes from storage of data in encrypted blocks that are decentralized, or stored on a network of computers around the world. This combination of encryption and decentralization ensures that data is practically impenetrable.

The most well-known manifestation of blockchain technology is Bitcoin, a digital currency that stores all transactions and amounts on a decentralized public ledger. But while Bitcoin’s meteoric rise has garnered it much hype, its utility pales in comparison to Ethereum.

Whereas Bitcoin is a digital currency, Ethereum is an entire blockchain-based platform whose operations are fueled by the cryptocurrency token Ether. Ethereum’s usefulness stems from its ability to run smart contracts, which are coding operations that make it possible to exchange money or data in a transparent and secure manner.

The Ethereum platform even comes complete with its own programming language, allowing developers to build applications and services that use its blockchain. The Catena Blockchain Suite, built by Ottawa-based company Bitaccess, is one such application.

How is the NRC using the Ethereum blockchain?

Every time the NRC gives a grant to a company or individual, it shares that information with Bitaccess, which stores the data on the secure and tamper-proof Ethereum blockchain. Individual grant information is then posted online.

Canadians can peruse grant information by monetary value, date, recipient and region. They can also verify grant information by clicking on the Transaction ID link, which takes them to the unique transaction listing on the online Ethereum transaction database Etherscan.io.

As of Saturday, Jan. 20, the biggest grant listed on the database was an $11,849,901 contribution to an industry R&D project at Ryerson University.

The initiative should come as music to the ears of Ethereum’s 23-year-old Russian-Canadian inventor Vitalik Buterin. While much of the talk surrounding the rise of cryptocurrencies has centred on their profit-making potential (the value of the Ether token has risen by over 10,000 per cent in the last one year), Buterin, who invented Ethereum in 2015 aged 19, has been keen to stress the larger mission behind the technology — his website and Twitter timeline frequently refer to the use of Ethereum to distribute power and trust among the masses, rather than focus them on traditional power brokers such as government and banks.

Arguably, its utility to the former *protects* it against those who wish to challenge it because of the latter. — Vitalik Non-giver of Ether (@VitalikButerin) September 3, 2017",,https://smartereum.com/2032/dotcom-bubble-housing-bubble-cryptocurrency-bubble-next-future-bitcoin-ethereum-ripple/,"Are cryptocurrencies in the bubble territory?

When you look at the 2 bubbles in recent economic history, one was the dotcom bubble in the 1990s and the housing bubble in 2000s. Cryptocurrencies have also risen in the last few years astronomical. This is creating fear among many investors as well as enthusiasts as to whether cryptocurrencies are heading into the bubble territory. The assets in the bubble do not end well.

When you actually look at the boom in cryptocurrencies over the past 12 months, you would realize that it has been immense and most of the cryptocurrencies have increased by more than 1000%. That is why most of the experts are actually wondering whether cryptocurrencies have entered a bubble territory.

The housing bubble resulted in bailouts of over $ 700 billion. Even though the dotcom bubble did not result in bailouts but it wiped out a lot of investor wealth. Moreover, the economy was also badly impacted by these 2 bubbles as well. Owing to these 2 bubbles, there were a lot of foreclosures as well as public protests and affecting politics as well. That is why, if at all cryptocurrencies are in the bubble territory, it would be very disastrous for the countries where most of the investors are located.

One thing which you have to, however, keep in mind is that the investors in cryptocurrencies are spread all over the globe. Owing to this very reason, the impact of cryptocurrency crash on an individual economy would be pretty limited. On the other hand, the above 2 bubbles which we spoke about were localized in nature that is they were constituted primarily in a single country. This is one of the main reasons why the economic impact was concentrated as well.

Moreover, we have a precedent of a global crisis as well in the form of 2008 financial crisis. That was also started by a single country and thereafter, its effects were felt all over the globe. Therefore, many of the experts are also thinking that since the investors this time around are spread all over the globe, the effect of the cryptocurrency crash would be much more drastic as well. Moreover, the amount of money which has gone into cryptocurrencies and also which is going into cryptocurrencies still is pretty huge. This is what is fuelling even more fear when it comes to cryptocurrencies.

It remains to be seen whether the value of the cryptocurrency continues to increase or whether it results in a bubble and crash. If indeed, it results in a bubble and crash, it remains to be seen whether the effects are spilled over to the formal economic system or they are confined to the cryptocurrency investors.",2018-01-20 13:47:22+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional Wall Street money might start making its way into cryptocurrency investments soon. An American rating agency is set to issue grades for bitcoin and a host of altcoins this week, possibly opening the door for more fund managers to enter the field.

Weiss Cryptocurrency Ratings

Weiss Ratings, a U.S. independent rating agency, had announced that it will issue letter grades on cryptocurrencies, to be released Wednesday January 24. Beyond market leader bitcoin (BTC), the rating agency will also issue grades for ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), cardano (ADA), NEM (XEM), litecoin (LTC), stellar (XLM), EOS, IOTA, Dash, NEO, TRON, Monero (XMR), bitcoin gold (BTG) and many others.

The rating agency, which was founded in 1971, grades about 55,000 institutions and investments including banks, credit union, insurance companies, stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. Unlike Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch and A.M. Best, Weiss Ratings prides itself on never accepting compensation of any kind from the entities it rates.

The Importance of a Rating for Bitcoin

The new cryptocurrency ratings are a first for any U.S. financial rating agency. They are said to be based on a model that analyzes thousands of data points on each coin’s technology, usage, and trading patterns. Besides enabling cautious investors to better assess the risks associated with an instrument they wish to invest in, ratings also define what trades many fund managers are allowed to take part in.

“Many cryptocurrencies are murky, overhyped and vulnerable to crashes. The market desperately needs the clarity that only robust, impartial ratings can provide,” said Weiss Ratings founder, Martin D. Weiss, PhD. “We’re proud to be the first to bring that benefit to investors — to help them cut through the hype and identify the few truly solid cryptocurrencies. Our ratings are based on hard data and objective analysis. But they’re bound to create controversy, including some grades that may come as a surprise to some people.”

He predicted that some of the leading cryptocurrencies will fade away with only a few successfully taking over the marketplace.

Glenn Hutchins has revealed how public investors can know which one of the leading cryptocurrencies will be the ""right answer"" and continue to thrive.

Hutchins is the former Chairman of Nasdaq and one of the first establishment investors

Mr Hutchins, who is the former Chairman of Nasdaq and one of the first establishment investors in bitcoin, compared the cryptocurrency battle to the beginning of the internet

Referring to the original commercial websites online, he said: ""You want to Google - you don't want to be Pets.Com.""

Asked on Fox Business News how to know which digital currency will be the ""right answer"" to the market, Mr Hutchins said: ""It's difficult.

""The price is a distraction - rather you should focus on the means of exchange. It’s a very small nascent property that has potential to be transformative.""

""Bitcoin could be the wrong solution - and other tokens like ethereum or Ripple could end up being the right answer.

""Can you take that technology and use it as a solution for an important customer problem? That's the question investors need to monitor.""",2018-01-21 09:19:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/19/bitcoin-could-lose-90-percent-of-its-value-wall-st-veteran-boockvar-warns.html,"Wall Street veteran Peter Boockvar predicts an epic crash will hit the cryptocurrency market.

He isn't sure if it'll come to a grinding halt or be a slow and steady drop — but he says it's coming.

Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, is certain crypto is in a giant bubble, and the air is already coming out.

""When something goes parabolic like this has, it typically ends up to where that parabola began,"" he said on CNBC's ""Futures Now.""

Boockvar, a CNBC contributor, contends bitcoin is in danger of dropping 90 percent from current levels. He calls it a classic bubble.

""I wouldn't be surprised if over the next year it's down to $1,000 to $3,000,"" he added.

That's where bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency player, was trading less than 12 months ago. Friday afternoon it was trading above $11,000.

Boockvar sees the collapse coming in tandem as interest rates rise around the globe. He blames central banks, including the Federal Reserve, for the cryptocurrency craze due to their easy money policies that were designed to ease the effects of the global financial crisis.

""You have to wonder if we never heard of quantitative easing, would there have been cryptocurrencies?"" Boockvar asked rhetorically in Thursday's interview.

Once the cryptocurrency market cracks, he contends, investor attitudes toward risk assets will change. According to Boockvar, the stock market could see collateral damage, but it would all be based on psychology — not on anything that's fundamentally wrong with the economy.",2018-01-19,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-wall-street-volatility-index-correlation-deutsche-bank-2018-1,"Cryptocurrencies are increasingly correlated with the CBOE Volatility Index, better known as Wall Street's ""Fear Index.""

That's according to a note from global financial strategist Masao Muraki and his team at Deutsche Bank.

The correlation relates to the fact that a low volatility environment encourages investors to move into riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, to achieve decent returns on their investments.



LONDON – There's a growing relationship between the price of bitcoin and the VIX, the volatility index colloquially known as Wall Street's ""Fear Index,"" according to analysts at Deutsche Bank.

Writing in a note circulated to clients on Friday, Deutsche Bank global financial strategist Masao Muraki, alongside his colleagues Hiroshi Torii and Tao Xu, said that in the three weeks of 2018 so far ""correlation between Bitcoin and VIX has increased dramatically.""

Right now, market volatility is close to record lows, as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility. Simply put, markets are pretty dull, with little to no major fluctuations going on. Stocks simply keep rising.

That, in turn, is leading investors to look for more and more risky ways of making money, which Deutsche Bank believes is part of the reason for the huge rise seen in the cryptocurrency markets in recent months.

""The current 'triple-low environment' of low interest rates, low spreads, and low volatility has given birth to new asset classes like implied volatility (ETFs selling volatility), and cryptocurrencies,"" the reports authors write.

But where does the correlation between volatility and bitcoin come in? Here's the explanation from Muraki, Torii, and Xu (emphasis ours):

""Cryptocurrencies are closely watched by retail investors, affecting their risk preferences for stocks and other risk assets. Although institutional investors recognize that stocks and other asset valuations may have entered bubble territory (US equities’ average P/E is around 20x), they cannot help but continue their risk-taking. Now, a growing number of institutional investors are watching cryptocurrencies as the frontier of risk-taking to evaluate the sustainability of asset prices.

""The result is that institutional investors, who are supposed to value assets using their sophisticated financial literacy, analysis, and information-gathering strengths, are actually seeking feedback about the market from cryptocurrency prices (which are mainly formed by retail investors).""

Basically, Muraki argues, as volatility in traditional assets drops, the price of bitcoin and other reasonably mainstream cryptocurrencies rises, as investors look for a way to make money. Here's the chart from Deutsche Bank showing just that:

While traditional market volatility remains close to rock bottom, the same is certainly not true of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Cryptocurrencies this week rode a rollercoaster, with bitcoin dropping as much as 25% in a single day early in the week, before rebounding aggressively.

At one point the market had lost $340 billion of value with the sell-off at its most severe on Tuesday and Wednesday.",2018-01-21,https://www.businessinsider.com/governments-not-give-up-control-of-money-crypto-crash-2018-1,"One reason people are selling out of bitcoin is because governments are moving against cryptocurrencies.

The promise of bitcoin is that it's anonymous and secure and the government can't touch it. That promise is unfulfilled.

Governments are not going to stand idly by while people replace or abandon fiat currency.

That's why cryptocurrencies will always be weak credit tokens compared to cash — governments may be annoying but they aren't stupid.



The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, stood at $531 billion just before the weekend, down from $830 billion at it's peak. That's a drop of about 36% in less than a month — a collapse that qualifies as a market crash.

People are casting around for an explanation. Why should this wildly popular new form of payment exchange, which feels like the future, suddenly drop in value? There are a large number of good reasons to sell bitcoin. And that's part of the problem — on most days it feels like there are more reasons to sell than to buy.

But the most obvious headwind comes from governments.

Russia, South Korea, China, Algeria, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan have all outright banned bitcoin or made noises about tightening regulation around crypto that would make owning the currency much less attractive. South Korea is moving toward an outright ban even though 10% of the entire bitcoin market is traded in South Korean won, according to Coin Hills.

Last week, the European Securities & Markets Authority said it might consider banning contracts-for-difference based on cryptos.

Governments are testing one of bitcoin's central promises: That the alt-currency is somehow immune to regulation because it offers uncrackable security with total anonymity. In theory, cryptocurrency enthusiasts will tell you, crypto allows you to hoard staggering wealth and the government can't touch it. (That's why criminals like it so much.)

It's a nice dream but it requires you to believe that governments will stand idly by while people abandon fiat currency. The government is not going to sit on its hands while people figure out how to stop paying taxes on both their income and capital gains because they are accepting payments via crypto. That would be insane. If there is one thing that governments are good at doing, it's making sure the government never goes away.

Of course the government wants to tax your bitcoin earnings. Of course the government isn't going to let you pay taxes in bitcoin (it's going to require real currency).

It's not just about creaming off the tax, or making sure the government can see how you earn money.

It's about the basis of civil society itself.

Money — fiat currency — underpins everything. Literally, everything.

Governments only stay in business because they have the power to control how much cash flows through the economy. They can create new money or reduce the amount in circulation. Their interest-rate-setting powers control the cost of everything, from the price of patching a pothole in the street to the cost of war in the Middle East.

If cryptocurrencies came even remotely close to becoming the preferred form of cash, then governments would be out of business. The idea that The Man is going abdicate that power to software? Dream on.

Bitcoin will lose this battle.

Governments will move more slowly than tech, sure. But eventually, they will wrestle control of crypto. At that point cryptocurrencies become mere credit tokens valued in actual cash. For most people, cash will remain the more useful medium, and the more valuable one.",2018-01-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/technology/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption.html,"The rules have kept attackers at bay in the nine years since the network got going. Without this process, most computer scientists agree, Bitcoin would not work.

But there is disagreement over the real value of Bitcoin and the network that supports it.

For people who consider Bitcoin nothing more than a speculative bubble — or a speculative bubble that has enabled online drug sales and ransom payments — any new contribution toward global warming is probably not worth it.

But Bitcoin aficionados counter that it has allowed for the creation of the first financial network with no government or company in charge. In countries like Zimbabwe and Argentina, Bitcoin has sometimes provided a more stable place to park money than the local currency. And in countries with more stable economies, Bitcoin has led to a flurry of new investments, jobs and start-up companies.

“Labeling Bitcoin mining as a ‘waste’ is a failure to look at the big picture,” Marc Bevand, a miner and analyst, wrote on his blog. The jobs alone, he added, “are a direct, measurable and positive impact that Bitcoin already made on the economy.”

But even some people who are interested in all that innovation have worried about the enormous electrical use.

Mr. de Vries, who keeps track of the use on the site Digiconomist, estimated that each Bitcoin transaction currently required 80,000 times more electricity to process than each Visa credit card transaction, for example.

“Visa is more centralized,” Mr. de Vries said. “If you really distrust the financial system, maybe that is unattractive. But is that difference really worth the additional energy cost? I think for most people that is probably not worth the case.”",2018-01-21,https://www.businessinsider.com/litecoin-founder-charlie-lee-on-bitcoin-and-the-cryptocurrency-bubble-2018-1,"Litecoin founder Charlie Lee shared his thoughts on the cryptocurrency space in an interview with Business Insider.

He said he has faith in the future of bitcoin, but believes its success depends on the help of technologies like Lightning Network, or alternative coins like litecoin, to make payment processing faster and less expensive.

He said bank speculation and mainstream investors aren't a bad thing — it's a sign that cryptocurrencies are being taken seriously.



Lee also shared his concerns that scam artists could take advantage of investors by talking up new coins.



When Charlie Lee first founded litecoin in 2011, cryptocurrencies were a whole different ball game. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency ever, was just two years old and saw its price jump from $1 a bitcoin to around $30, before falling back to the single digits by the close of the year.

There were few, if any, competing coins — though with a tight knit community of technically savvy engineers leading the charge, there were plenty of people with ideas for how to make bitcoin better.

One of those people was Lee, a Google software engineer at the time, who developed litecoin to address the widespread scalability flaws which prevent bitcoin from processing much more than four transactions per second on average.

In June, Lee left a four-year stint on the engineering team at Coinbase to focus on developing his brainchild. Since then, litecoin has grown its market cap from $1.4 billion to $10.5 billion, and its price has soared 650% to $190.70 per coin.

Business Insider sat down with Lee to find out more about litecoin, and how the space has changed in the past seven years.

Becky Peterson: What makes litecoin different than bitcoin and ethereum?

Charlie Lee: I've always known that it would be hard for bitcoin to scale and be the one coin that does everything for everyone. So my vision for litecoin has always been to complement bitcoin — to be the payments currency. Where bitcoin would be digital gold, litecoin would be silver. It's more useful for payments. And bitcoin would be better for store of value.

Charlie Lee founded the cryptocurrency litecoin in 2011. In December, he sold off all of his digital holdings. Charlie Lee

Peterson: Is litecoin on it's own blockchain?

Lee: Yes. The difference between litecoin and bitcoin is that litecoin is four times faster. Transactions happen on average every 2.5 minutes versus every 10 minutes on bitcoin.

It uses a different proof of work algorithm, so the miners that are mining bitcoin cannot mine litecoin, and vice versa. So it doesn't compete with bitcoin for miners.

Peterson: It seems like bitcoin is already not very practical for payments. Do you agree?

Lee: Technology like Lightning Network will help, but it won't be able to handle everything. Fees will be higher on bitcoin, even with Lightning Network. So litecoin I think can find its own niche to help address payment fees.

Peterson: You spent four years at Coinbase, part of which was as director of engineering. Before that you were a software engineer at Google. In terms of the companies being built around cryptocurrencies, do you think the industry is moving in the right direction?

Lee: Right now, most companies in the space are making money from investment and speculation of the currencies — exchanges are likely making a lot of money today. We do see some payment companies, but they've struggled in that aspect quite a bit because bitcoin currently is struggling to figure out how it will be used as payment.

I think it will take some more time for tech like Lightning Network to be massively adopted before we'll see more usage of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment.

Peterson: So do you think bitcoin will eventually adapt, or do you think another cryptocurrency will take the lead?

Lee: I think bitcoin will be able to adapt. Think of bitcoin as digital gold. Gold is very valuable but people don't use it to buy stuff on a day to day basis. But with bitcoin you can easily convert it, for example, from bitcoin to litecoin and then use litecoin for payment. And there might be some other technology that comes out that makes it even easier.

Peterson: Vitalik Buterin, the cofounder of the ethereum blockchain, has publicly criticized the cryptocurrency community for focusing on making money, rather than ""achieving something meaningful for society."" Do you agree with his criticism?

It won't be successful if it's only one group of people supporting the movement. I think this is just a natural progression. I don't see anything wrong with that.

Lee: Initially most of the bitcoin supporters were crypto anarchists. They were against big governments and banks. But these days people are into crypto because of investment and speculation purposes, and banks are getting involved.

I wouldn't say that's bad. It's just going mainstream. It won't be successful if it's only one group of people supporting the movement. I think this is just a natural progression. I don't see anything wrong with that.

Peterson: There was some criticism of you at the end of last year in terms of influencing litecoin prices. It seemed to be part of a larger issue with other coins, in terms of how volatile and responsive to media coverage their prices can be.

Lee: I think there's a bit too much scam in the space, in terms of people getting in just to get rich quick.

It's quite easy for a founder to pump a coin and make it seem like it's the latest and greatest and it will cure world hunger, and the price can go up to $10 billion. And it's easy for whoever did that to cash out.

And it will leave a lot of people hanging. A lot of people can lose a lot of money because of this.

I'm sad to see this happening all over the place. There's a lot of initial coin offerings (ICOs) that have nothing but a white paper that's full of technical jargon, and they're able to raise $100's of millions of dollars; these coins will likely just go to zero.

A lot of people will get hurt. So I am kind of sad to see that. Hopefully things will get sorted out and there will be less of this and more focus on technology and moving the space forward.",2018-01-21,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-market-correction-asian-trading/,"For a number of weeks before New Year the good times rolled for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as markets went from strength to strength and new records highs were made across the board. A different picture has been painted in January as they’ve have largely been down trending following a high on January 7 when total market capacity reached a record $832 billion. Since that day the markets have fallen by 33% to around $558 billion where they sit today.

Bearish on crypto

Bitcoin reached the lowest point since the end of November last week but rallied back to $11,600 during today’s Asian trading session. However this is down from a high of $12,800 just two days ago indicating that the bears maybe taking hold once again and causing the market correction. The altcoin board is a sea of red today as they are also all down but as much as 14% in some cases in a pattern that is now becoming quite repetitive. Bitcoin is still the king of crypto and its siblings usually follow suit in either direction.

Ethereum has lost around 8.3% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing according to Livecoinwatch – this is a fall to around $1,060 from $1,190 a couple of days ago. However it should be noted that ETH is still showing a strong resistance to the downward slide of Bitcoin’s price since its all-time high of nearly $20,000.

Asian exchanges are dominating the trade and there is a selling mood this morning. Ripple has fallen by a similar 8.5% in the past 24 hours now shedding over 60% of its value since that high of $3.8 on January 5. Bitcoin Cash, Cardano and Litecoin have all followed suit dropping on average ten percent. This market correction has yet to reach the lows of last week’s mass selloff which was largely fueled by another clampdown in China and a lot of media FUD.

Whale pressure

The expiration of the first futures contract may also have taken its toll on the markets. By offering these contracts to institutional traders through well-established financial exchanges and trading houses raises the specter of whales being able to manipulate the markets to spark a selloff if they have shorted the contract. As it turns out the bears came out victorious for the first XBT F8 contract from CBoE as it was settled at a price of $10,900, well down on the $17,000 that BTC was trading around when they were launched.

There could be more downward pressure on markets when the CME contracts expire in a few days on January 26. The CME contracts are tied to 5 Bitcoin’s whereas CBoE’s contract was only one, the stakes are larger this time and the markets could be feeling it already.",2018-01-22 04:05:56+00:00

The measure comes on top of stepped up efforts by Seoul to temper South Koreans’ obsession with cryptocurrencies. Everyone from housewives to college students and office workers have rushed to trade the market despite warnings from global policymakers about investing in an asset that lacks broad regulatory oversight.

The bitcoin price in South Korea extended loss following the latest regulatory announcement, down 3.34 percent at $12,699 as of 0409 GMT, according to Bithumb, the country’s second-largest virtual currency exchange.

Bitcoin BTC=BTSP slumped nearly 20 percent last week to a four-week low on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, pressured by worries over a possible ban on trading the virtual asset in South Korean exchanges. In Tuesday afternoon trade, it was up 5.4 percent at $10,925.

Policy makers around the world are calling for tougher, coordinated regulation of cryptocurrency trading. South Korea’s chief financial regulator last week said the government may consider shutting down domestic virtual currency exchanges.

South Korea’s Presidential office has clarified that an outright ban on trading on the virtual currency exchanges is only one of the steps being considered, and not a measure that has been finalized.

“The government is still discussing whether an outright ban is needed or not, internally,” a government official who declined to be named said after Tuesday’s briefing.

Over the past month, government statements have underscored differences between the Justice Ministry, which has pushed for a more hardline approach, and regulators who have shown a reluctance to enforce an outright ban.

Starting Jan. 30, cryptocurrency traders in South Korea will not be allowed to make deposits into their virtual currency exchange wallets unless the names on their bank accounts matches the account name in cryptocurrency exchanges, Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission told a news conference in Seoul.

“Everyone knew this was coming, as the government already said they will enforce the real-name system before. Rather, I can see this as a chance to go in, not out. I don’t see any reason to take my money out,” said a local bitcoin investor who only agreed to be identified by his family name Ahn.

The regulator has previously said it will come up with detailed guidelines for local banks to properly identify its clients by their real names in cryptocurrency transactions.

To make deposits into virtual coin wallets, cryptocurrency traders will need to identify themselves with their real names at the exchange and have those matched with information at local banks by Jan. 30.",2018-01-23 02:08:04+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/opinion/irs-bitcoin-fear.html,"The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are “arm’s length” counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules.

It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be.

One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product.

More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs.

A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code.

The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion.

More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult — but no less necessary — challenge.",2018-01-22,https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/22/how-to-price-cryptocurrencies/,"Predicting cryptocurrency prices is a fool’s game, yet this fool is about to try.

At that time, if you wanted to set up a web server, you had to physically ship a Windows server or Sun Sparc Station to a server farm where it would do the hard work of delivering Pets.com HTML. At the same time, Linux, like a freight train running on a parallel path to Microsoft and Sun, would consistently allow developers to build one-off projects very quickly and easily using an OS and toolset that were improving daily. In comparison, then, the massive hardware and software expenditures associated with the status quo solution providers were deeply inefficient, and very quickly all of the tech giants that made their money on software now made their money on services or, like Sun, folded.

From the acorn of Linux an open-source forest bloomed. But there was one clear problem: You couldn’t make money from open source. You could consult and you could sell products that used open-source components, but early builders built primarily for the betterment of humanity and not the betterment of their bank accounts.

Cryptocurrencies have followed the Linux model almost exactly, but cryptocurrencies have cash value. Therefore, when you’re working on a crypto project you’re not doing it for the common good or for the joy of writing free software. You’re writing it with the expectation of a big payout. This, therefore, clouds the value judgements of many programmers. The same folks that brought you Python, PHP, Django and Node.js are back… and now they’re programming money.

Check the codebase

This year will be the year of great reckoning in the token sale and cryptocurrency space. While many companies have been able to get away with poor or unusable codebases, I doubt developers will let future companies get away with so much smoke and mirrors. It’s safe to say we can expect posts like this one detailing Storj’s anemic codebase to become the norm and, more importantly, that these commentaries will sink many so-called ICOs. Though massive, the money trough that is flowing from ICO to ICO is finite and at some point there will be greater scrutiny paid to incomplete work.

What does this mean? It means to understand cryptocurrency you have to treat it like a startup. Does it have a good team? Does it have a good product? Does the product work? Would someone want to use it? It’s far too early to assess the value of cryptocurrency as a whole, but if we assume that tokens or coins will become the way computers pay each other in the future, this lets us hand wave away a lot of doubt. After all, not many people knew in 2000 that Apache was going to beat nearly every other web server in a crowded market or that Ubuntu instances would be so common that you’d spin them up and destroy them in an instant.

The key to understanding cryptocurrency pricing is to ignore the froth, hype and FUD and instead focus on true utility. Do you think that some day your phone will pay another phone for, say, an in-game perk? Do you expect the credit card system to fold in the face of an Internet of Value? Do you expect that one day you’ll move through life splashing out small bits of value in order to make yourself more comfortable? Then by all means, buy and hold or speculate on things that you think will make your life better. If you don’t expect the Internet of Value to improve your life the way the TCP/IP internet did (or you do not understand enough to hold an opinion), then you’re probably not cut out for this. NASDAQ is always open, at least during banker’s hours.

Still will us? Good, here are my predictions.

The rundown

Here is my assessment of what you should look at when considering an “investment” in cryptocurrencies. There are a number of caveats we must address before we begin:

Crypto is not a monetary investment in a real currency, but an investment in a pie-in-the-sky technofuture. That’s right: When you buy crypto you’re basically assuming that we’ll all be on the deck of the Starship Enterprise exchanging them like Galactic Credits one day. This is the only inevitable future for crypto bulls. While you can force crypto into various economic models and hope for the best, the entire platform is techno-utopianist and assumes all sorts of exciting and unlikely things will come to pass in the next few years. If you have spare cash lying around and you like Star Wars, then you’re golden. If you bought bitcoin on a credit card because your cousin told you to, then you’re probably going to have a bad time.

Don’t trust anyone. There is no guarantee and, in addition to offering the disclaimer that this is not investment advice and that this is in no way an endorsement of any particular cryptocurrency or even the concept in general, we must understand that everything I write here could be wrong. In fact, everything ever written about crypto could be wrong, and anyone who is trying to sell you a token with exciting upside is almost certainly wrong. In short, everyone is wrong and everyone is out to get you, so be very, very careful.

You might as well hold. If you bought when BTC was $18,000 you’d best just hold on. Right now you’re in Pascal’s Wager territory. Yes, maybe you’re angry at crypto for screwing you, but maybe you were just stupid and you got in too high and now you might as well keep believing because nothing is certain, or you can admit that you were a bit overeager and now you’re being punished for it but that there is some sort of bitcoin god out there watching over you. Ultimately you need to take a deep breath, agree that all of this is pretty freaking weird, and hold on.

Now on with the assessments.

Bitcoin – Expect a rise over the next year that will surpass the current low. Also expect bumps as the SEC and other federal agencies around the world begin regulating the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in very real ways. Now that banks are in on the joke they’re going to want to reduce risk. Therefore, the bitcoin will become digital gold, a staid, boring and volatility proof safe haven for speculators. Although all but unusable as a real currency, it’s good enough for what we need it to do and we also can expect quantum computing hardware to change the face of the oldest and most familiar cryptocurrency.

Ethereum – Ethereum could sustain another few thousand dollars on its price as long as Vitalik Buterin, the creator, doesn’t throw too much cold water on it. Like a remorseful Victor Frankenstein, Buterin tends to make amazing things and then denigrate them online, a sort of self-flagellation that is actually quite useful in a space full of froth and outright lies. Ethereum is the closest we’ve come to a useful cryptocurrency, but it is still the Raspberry Pi of distributed computing — it’s a useful and clever hack that makes it easy to experiment but no one has quite replaced the old systems with new distributed data stores or applications. In short, it’s a really exciting technology, but nobody knows what to do with it.

Where will the price go? It will hover around $1,000 and possibly go as high as $1,500 this year, but this is a principled tech project and not a store of value.

Altcoins – One of the signs of a bubble is when average people make statements like “I couldn’t afford a Bitcoin so I bought a Litecoin.” This is exactly what I’ve heard multiple times from multiple people and it’s akin to saying “I couldn’t buy hamburger so I bought a pound of sawdust instead. I think the kids will eat it, right?” Play at your own risk. Altcoins are a very useful low-risk play for many, and if you create an algorithm — say to sell when the asset hits a certain level — then you could make a nice profit. Further, most altcoins will not disappear overnight. I would honestly recommend playing with Ethereum instead of altcoins, but if you’re dead set on it, then by all means, enjoy.

Tokens – This is where cryptocurrency gets interesting. Tokens require research, education and a deep understanding of technology to truly assess. Many of the tokens I’ve seen are true crapshoots and are used primarily as pump and dump vehicles. I won’t name names, but the rule of thumb is that if you’re buying a token on an open market then you’ve probably already missed out. The value of the token sale as of January 2018 is to allow crypto whales to turn a few cent per token investment into a 100X return. While many founders talk about the magic of their product and the power of their team, token sales are quite simply vehicles to turn 4 cents into 20 cents into a dollar. Multiply that by millions of tokens and you see the draw.

The answer is simple: find a few projects you like and lurk in their message boards. Assess if the team is competent and figure out how to get in very, very early. Also expect your money to disappear into a rat hole in a few months or years. There are no sure things, and tokens are far too bleeding-edge a technology to assess sanely.

You are reading this post because you are looking to maintain confirmation bias in a confusing space. That’s fine. I’ve spoken to enough crypto-heads to know that nobody knows anything right now and that collusion and dirty dealings are the rule of the day. Therefore, it’s up to folks like us to slowly buy surely begin to understand just what’s going on and, perhaps, profit from it. At the very least we’ll all get a new Linux of Value when we’re all done.

Image: Photo by Fabian Blank on Unsplash",2018-01-22,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-swiss-crypto-idUSKBN1FB1TM,"ZURICH (Reuters) - One of the top lawyers in the booming cryptocurrency industry says the legal structure he helped set up to raise funds for new virtual currencies is “old, inflexible and stupid” and may no longer be fit for purpose.

Luka Mueller of MME Legal law firm gestures during a panel discussion with Stephen Palley (R) of Anderson Kill, LLP law firm at the Blockchain Summit - Crypto Valley in Zug, Switzerland November 22, 2017. Picture taken November 22, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann

The Swiss lawyer’s comments come as regulators around the world increase their scrutiny of initial coin offerings (ICOs), the digital fundraisers that precede a currency’s launch.

There is also growing scrutiny from investors. The Zug-based Tezos Foundation is facing U.S. class-action lawsuits from those who say they were misled and defrauded in its ICO.

Luka Mueller’s MME law firm helped set up foundations in Switzerland for Tezos and some of the world’s biggest ICOs, including those of Bancor and Ethereum. Many foundations applied for non-profit tax status. The money raised in the ICO is treated as a donation that may not be returned.

Regulators in the United States, the UK, and elsewhere are looking at whether an ICO should have similar investor protection to an initial public offering (IPO) for a company.

Mueller told Reuters cryptocurrency groups involving U.S. participants or gaining backing from investors should set up companies instead of the Swiss foundations he helped popularize.

“If you structure your token sale in a way that it would look like an initial public offering, then even if you launch a (blockchain) protocol, the foundation is maybe not suitable,” he said.

“If...the background is more an investor environment rather than a technical environment, yes, do all the registrations. If you want to sell it, if you want to be active and actively promoting it in the US, apply U.S. law.”

He said a foundation could still work for ICOs if a project is of interest mainly to technical experts rather than investors.

“CRYPTO VALLEY”

Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, exploded in value since it was launched in 2009. Its price increased from less than a cent in early 2010 to a record shy of $20,000 in December 2017.

The coins use encryption and a blockchain transaction database enabling fast and anonymous transfer of funds without centralized payment systems.

ICOs skyrocketed in 2017, reaching nearly $3 billion through September. Switzerland attracted around a quarter of the world’s ICOs with nearly $650 million raised there in the first nine months of 2017, according to data compiled by cryptocurrency research firm Smith + Crown.

Blockchain groups have set up foundations in the Swiss “Crypto Valley,” but the model has also loosely been exported elsewhere including to the Seychelles, Mauritius and Singapore.

Tezos aims to be a blockchain that’s more reliable than the ones behind bitcoin and ether. Its foundation raised $232 million last July.

It is now facing at least half a dozen class-action lawsuits in the United States. The plaintiffs are seeking a refund as well as damages.

They made non-refundable donations and expected to receive tokens called Tezzies when the network launched. But a former board member said the project is in a state of paralysis because of the lawsuits and a dispute between the developers and the foundation’s president. The network has not yet launched.

Tezos Foundation officials have declined to comment on the lawsuits. An attorney for the founders, Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, said of the first lawsuit that is was without merit and that the couple would aggressively defend themselves.

Under MME’s guidelines, tokens become property with an enforceable right once the blockchain launches and the token receives a spot on the first block. Before the launch contributors have no such rights.

Mueller said the foundation structure his team helped bring to cryptocurrency groups was initially conceived as a means to ensure funds were used for a set purpose and to protect developers from any liability over the project’s success.

“It’s a concept of a donation, from which it is clear you donate,” Mueller said. “You donate into a structure and you donate to a team and to their idea.”

By MME’s definition, the developers behind the tokens are not liable for the projects and there is no counterparty to sue.

BURNT FINGERS

Other experts on Swiss foundation law say it would be nearly impossible for contributors to see money refunded from the foundation.

Alexandre Swoboda, an economist who sat on the Swiss National Bank’s council from 1997 to 2009 said: “ICOs are basically about financing yourself by giving these people these new coins, and holding those new coins doesn’t give you a claim on anything except to be part of the club that holds those coins.”

But regulators are looking into this.

Investors in the United States may have been encouraged to file lawsuits after the U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in July stated that some of the coins, also called tokens, may be considered securities subject to federal rules and regulation.

This has opened the door for courts to follow suit in enforcing the interpretation of ICOs as security sales.

Mueller conceded that while a foundation was a useful model for launching a new blockchain project that expected to see interest exclusively from a small technically-geared community, other projects would “need to have an operational company, like a GmbH or an AG, and not a foundation.”

“The Swiss foundation actually is a very old, inflexible, stupid model,” he said. “The foundation is not designed for operations.”

Nevertheless, he said the vast majority of cryptocurrency fundraiser participants understood the terms and were therefore accountable for the risky decision to contribute.

“You as a user must be absolutely clear — and if you don’t understand it keep your fingers away — that if you have an ether or a bitcoin, and it does not work, you have nobody to claim against,” he said.",2018-01-22 14:12:35+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-metals-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN1FB1WK,"LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-based commodities fund Tiberius Group plans to make a foray into cryptocurrencies with the launch of what may be the first digital money underpinned by physically deliverable metals including industrials such as aluminium and copper.

The fund, which manages $300 million (215.81 million pounds) of investments and also mines and trades metals, aims to launch the Tiberius coin, or tcoin, in July, its co-founder and chief executive Christoph Eibl said.

Allowing buyers to redeem tcoin for metal would give the currency a minimum value and avoid the extreme volatility of other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Eibl believes.

“We want to propose the idea of a cryptocurrency with real tangible net worth,” he told Reuters.

Millions of investors looking for quick returns and an opt-out from government-run money have surged into digital currencies, catapulting Bitcoin, the world’s biggest, from $1,000 to almost $20,000 and back to below $12,000 in the last 12 months.

Tiberius coin will not be the first to be underpinned by assets.

Gold-backed currencies such as DigixGlobal in Singapore and Goldmint in Russia are already in place. Others backed by real estate and diamonds are in development and Venezuela plans a cryptocurrency backed by oil, gas, gold and diamond reserves.

Tiberius coin appears to be the first backed by industrial metals, market analysts and participants said.

Because Tiberius is an established player in the metals industry, the tcoin may have a higher chance of success than previous digital coin offerings which have struggled to take off, Charles Hayter, founder of cryptocurrency data analysis firm Crypto Compare, told Reuters.

“The problem has always been that the crypto provider has never had a solid reputation or there has been speculation about whether the underlying metals exist or are stored securely. It sounds like you’ve got that in this case,” Hayter said.

The involvement of an investment fund may deter some investors who see cryptocurrencies as an escape from the regulated financial system and governments, however.

Unlike Bitcoin, which is decentralised, user-generated and without a single administrator, Tiberius coin will be operated by a corporation.

“That starts to jar against the libertarian element of the crypto community,” said Hayter.

Tiberius plans to register its currency with regulators, first in Switzerland and then more widely, in an effort to minimise the risk of shutdown or restriction by authorities.

Bitcoin and other digital monies have plunged in value in the past month partly because of fear of a regulatory crackdown aimed at protecting investors from fraud. Japan, China, South Korea and the United States are grappling with how to regulate the sector. India wants to tax it.

“We also have more serious concerns of systemic risk within the market, specifically concentrated around exchanges and other safe-haven coins,” said Eibl. “We actually see the sell-off as helping the tcoin as it raises awareness of the risks within the cryptocurrency market.”

LONDON METAL EXCHANGE

Tiberius received thousands of inquiries about its plans following the publication of a white paper on the currency in December, Eibl said.

He said the coin could be used to invest in metals or hedge exposure to them as well as to protect against inflation.

Tiberius plans to market the coin to investors around the end of February. It is likely to trade at a premium above the price of the underlying metal, with the size of the premium dependent on the supply in circulation and demand.

The coin will be backed by industrial metals stored in London Metal Exchange warehouses and precious metals held at selected refineries and will, like most other cryptocurrencies, be run on a blockchain platform, said Eibl.

Blockchain - or distributed ledger - technology keeps track of and authenticates a continuously growing list of transaction data, which is secured by a global network of computers and is virtually impossible to be tampered with or revised.

Three versions of the Tiberius coin will be launched, each underpinned by a different investment strategy.

One will include nickel, cobalt and aluminium used to build electric vehicles. Another will be backed by copper, tin, zinc, metals used in high-tech sectors such as robotics.

A third will include precious metals gold, platinum and palladium, which are used as hedges against inflation and financial and economic uncertainty.

More coins backed by either a single metal or a combination could be launched at a later date, Eibl said.",2018-01-22 14:32:37+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/match-trade-releases-new-crypto-exchange-platform-coinmatch/,"Match-Trade Technologies LLC, (“Match-Trade”), headquartered in Irvine, California, a fully integrated forex and cryptocurrency technology company, announced the launch of its new Crypto Exchange Platform named as CoinMatch. It is the most significant development in Company’s cryptocurrency portfolio of products and services which include – crypto feeds, payment gateways and liquidity solutions.

As cryptocurrencies gain more traction and acceptance as an asset class in 2018, the demand for proven and higher performance platforms continue to rise. As a result, the market saw the launch of several new cryptocurrency trading platforms last year. However, not all trading platforms are created equal, nor they meet the requisite capabilities that users’ demand. CoinMatch (www.coinmatch.io) is the leading platform which provides a complete solution for physical cryptocurrency trading.

Michael Karczewski – Head of Business Operations at Match-Trade, further elaborated, “CoinMatch was one of the most ambitious projects in Company’s history, and we have received great interest from various businesses across the globe seeking to enter cryptocurrency exchange market, and we are providing them with full technology support and consulting services so that they enter, run and grow their successful crypto exchange business.”

Next generation functionality

Today’s crypto exchange platforms require more usability and capabilities to meet users’ requirements. Users currently are looking for options that exceed traditional investment instruments and platforms.

An in-depth look at CoinMatch’s platform reveals a framework that is streamlined for ease of use. This is further reinforced by a lengthy list of functionalities supported on the platform. This includes the availability of interactive charts, complete with drawing options, a market watch that lists all instruments, as well as full deposit/withdrawal options in each cryptocurrency or FIAT currency.

Moreover, CoinMatch also includes a detailed history of deposits and withdrawals as well as a Live Order Book. Users have a full range of information at their fingertips with limit, market, and stop orders as well as a full display of all orders. The entire interface is available for customization, including language features.

As a major product feature, CoinMatch’s platform is highly secure, with a two-factor authentication and notification settings. One of the useful attributes of the platform is its ability to have crypto wallets integrated with exchange and storage of any leading cryptos being traded.

The platform goes with a detailed Backoffice and administrator application for full user control including KYC and AML functionalities. CoinMatch also provides REST API, which is now standard functionality for each exchange.

Crypto Liquidity in focus

Along with the technology, Match-Trade will be providing access to crypto liquidity for all companies, who will be using CoinMatch platform. This is one of the most important factors for all exchanges, which often suffer from insufficient liquidity, and discourage users from active trading.

Liquidity will be provided for leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Dash. Moving forward, we expect to expand on the list of cryptocurrencies. Users and clients requested to explore and test the CoinMatch’s interface and liquidity options.

Match-Trade Technologies will be exhibiting at financial B2B iFX EXPO Asia in Hong Kong on 23-25 January 2018, where the official release of the CoinMatch platform will take place.

As a result, the graphics cards are extremely difficult to find. Some are being sold for double or more their original price.

The dearth of available graphics cards has become a meme among PC gaming enthusiasts.

Nvidia is urging retailers to prioritize PC gaming buyers over cryptocurrency miners.



It's a terrible time to build a gaming PC.

The process of building one is actually easier than its ever been, and playing video games on a PC is a delight. The problem is that graphics cards (GPUs) — the crucial component that powers the visuals of a PC — are in extremely high demand, which makes them difficult to find at their intended prices. Many resellers are jacking up the price by double or more.

The demand, however, isn't due to a massive influx of new PC gaming enthusiasts. The demand is being driven by cryptocurrency mining.

Though the graphics cards from companies like Nvidia and AMD are capable of powering cutting-edge gaming visuals, they're also capable of mining cryptocurrency. More than just capable, they're one of the main tools used by cryptocurrency miners.

As such, they're sold out pretty much everywhere.

A quick check of retail websites from Amazon to Best Buy to Newegg reveals the same thing: Back-order options, or sold-out signs, or re-sellers with huge mark-ups.

Nvidia's flagship GPU, the GTX 1080 Ti, has a suggested retail price of $700.

The lowest price for one on Amazon starts around $1,100:

As such, PC gaming communities on Reddit are full of jokes about how hard it is to find a graphics card for a decent price. There's even a major thread dedicated to explaining the high prices of graphics cards — it's given prominent placement at the top of the ""Build a PC"" subreddit.

And then there are anecdotes like this one, from an Ethereum-mining Facebook group:

Both Nvidia and AMD declined to comment for this story.

German website Computer Base got in touch with Nvidia Germany public-relations manager Boris Böhles, who told the publication that Nvidia is actively encouraging retailers to ""make the appropriate arrangements"" so that graphics cards are available for the intended consumer.

Nvidia can't force its manufacturing partners to limit their sales, nor its retail partners to do the same. It's a problem of supply and demand.

The problem, of course, is that cryptocurrency mining is more popular than ever.

And as more people discover the concept, more people need hardware to power their new hobby. Without a swift increase in supply from graphics-card makers like Nvidia, AMD, Asus, and others, it's unlikely that this problem is going away anytime soon.",2018-01-22,https://www.extremetech.com/computing/262577-nvidia-calls-limits-crypto-hysteria-pushes-gpu-prices-sky-high,"One of the most important choices every PC builder makes is which graphics card to buy. That choice has been getting much more stressful lately as the price of GPUs skyrockets. You can thank the surge of interest in cryptocurrency for the increase in graphics card prices, but Nvidia is trying to do something about it. “Trying” is the operative word here.

As recently as the middle of last year, you could get a high-end GPU from Nvidia for around retail price. The cost of AMD’s cards has been on an upward trend for even longer, though. Late last year, increased interest in cryptocurrency sent speculative virtual money enthusiasts running for their nearest GPU retailer to pick up equipment for a mining operation. That’s left precious few cards for gamers who just want to frag some noobs.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are too mature now for a small-scale GPU mining operation to net much cash. Even newer coins like Monero might only make an operator the equivalent of a few dollars per day, but a jump in the value of the coins could make them instant millionaires. As a result, it’s a terrible time to buy a GPU for gaming. Cards like the GTX 1070 that cost under $500 last year are now selling for closer to $1,000. Even used cards will cost you $800 or more.

Nvidia has had enough of the price gouging, so it’s asking retailers to reserve some supply for gamers. Specifically, Nvidia’s proposal is a limit of two cards per customer, enough to set up a sweet SLI rig if that’s what you’re into. It can’t make anyone do that, but its own online store has implemented the pricing limit. Nvidia hasn’t increased the price of the “Founder’s Edition” cards, either. Even with the limit, Nvidia’s supply is all sold out.

It’s nice that Nvidia is taking notice of the problem, but targeting retailers probably won’t do much good. A significant volume of supply is probably never making it to retailers in the first place. Manufacturers like Asus and MSI are happy to sell cards wholesale in bulk. So, miners buy a crate of GPUs direct and save a few bucks, but retailers have fewer cards to sell.

If you need a graphics card, your best bet is to wait on Nvidia to restock at its more reasonable prices. I wouldn’t expect those units to last long, though. If people aren’t buying them for crypto mining, they might just flip them for a big profit to those who are.

Bitcoin critics try to attack the cryptocurrency from all angles, but one thing no one can deny is that BTC has now completely captured the attention of the masses. According to figures in local reports, there are already more than twice as many people invested in bitcoin as those who trade stocks in Latin America’s largest economy, Brazil.

Bitcoin > Stocks

The number of bitcoin investors in Brazil has already surpassed the total number of individuals registered on the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Brasil Bolsa Balcão S.A. or B3). The country’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges – which process about 95% of all cryptocurrency transactions in Brazil – had 1.4 million registered clients in December 2017. This number is more than twice the 619,000 registered individuals in B3 at the end of last year, reports Brazil’s largest media conglomerate Globo. There may also be more Brazilian bitcoin traders who use foreign exchanges or only trade offline.

The cause of this popularity, according to the owners of these exchanges, is the massive price rally last year. “The variable that explains this is the price of bitcoin,” said Rodrigo Batista, CEO of Mercado Bitcoin (Bitcoin Market), which reached 750,000 customers in 2017, a jump of 275% in comparison to the previous year. For André Horta of Bitcoin to You, which serves 300,000 people, the fall in the profitability of other investments was another factor that attracted investors to bitcoin.

Exchanges Can’t Keep Up with Demand

The flood of investors attracted by bitcoin brought significant growth to Brazilian exchanges, which similarly to venues all over the world greatly hampered their ability to cope with normal client service. At Mercado Bitcoin, for example, there are now 5,000 new registrations per day. A year ago, it was a maximum of 500. The result of this was an explosion in the number of complaints against the companies, according to the report.

To handle the number of investors, who are growing at almost 3.5 times from year to year, exchanges have had to strengthen their IT systems and hire more staff. Bitcoin to You has quadrupled its staff to 40 people.

With 350,000 registrations, São Paulo-based Foxbit had to suspend service to new investors in mid-December. “From one day to the next, the daily volume has gone up five times and we have not been able to meet this demand,” said Guto Schiavon, founding partner of Foxbit. From 40 people in November, the company’s staff rose to 60, and another 15 people were hired in January when the company reopened to the public.

Also, the American Enterprise Institute is hosting a panel discussion on bitcoin from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Feb. 12. You can watch it live online at aei.org. The main question the panelists will address is: Are bitcoin and its competitors sustainable currencies, or is this just another investing fad that will eventually crash spectacularly?

Bert Ely, principal of Ely & Company Inc., a consulting firm in Alexandria will be on the panel. Ely is a prolific pontificator on financial issues, and his latest mission is to caution investors about chasing bitcoin returns. I’ve been reaching out to financial experts to ask them what people are asking me about investing in bitcoin, and here are Ely’s answers.

Q: Why is bitcoin bad for the average investor?

AD

Ely: Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies, except possibly some of the Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), are not real investments comparable to a home, real estate, stocks, bonds, mutual funds or other assets that produce income or are tangible assets that can experience genuine price appreciation.

AD

In a sense, cryptocurrencies are a mirage, a game of sorts, that will end badly for most investors, especially if they have borrowed money to gamble on cryptocurrency price appreciation.

Q: Why shouldn’t some people, with money they can afford to lose, chase bitcoin returns?

Ely: People who like to gamble with money they can afford to lose should view investing in, or actively buying and selling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as akin to gambling at a casino, betting on the horses at the racetrack or buying lottery tickets.

Q: Some have compared bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme in which money from new investors is used to pay off earlier investors. How is investing in bitcoin like a Ponzi scheme?

Ely: I argue that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, except possibly some ICOs, are akin to Ponzi schemes because those who create the cryptocurrencies (bitcoin miners, Ripple, etc.) will have profited greatly, at the expense of those who are holding cryptocurrencies when these schemes collapse.

Based on the market value of all cryptocurrencies, the wealth transfer from cryptocurrency losers to winners will be enormous when the bubble finally bursts, far exceeding what folks who invested with Bernie Madoff lost.

Given the amount of turnover (short-term buying and selling) in cryptocurrencies, I suspect already realized losses are many billions of dollars. Losses will be especially painful for those folks who have borrowed on their credit cards or against the equity in their homes to gamble on cryptocurrency price appreciation.

Q: What do you tell folks who fear they will miss out on what could be a big win? In every bubble there are winners, right?

Ely: In hindsight, those who invested early in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and already have cashed out, are the winners. While some who jump into the cryptocurrency game today may get lucky and actually make a profit if they then sell at the right time, most will lose — the cryptocurrency train has left the station.

Q: What lessons can investors learn from the recent drop in bitcoin?

Ely: The recent drop in the price of most cryptocurrencies, and not just bitcoin, illustrates how volatile the price of all cryptocurrencies is and the reality that this price volatility has no rational basis. That is the case because there is no there there with cryptocurrencies. They have no intrinsic value, nor do they generate any income or cash flow for those who “invest” in them.",2018-01-23,https://www.investopedia.com/news/bitcoin-has-regulation-problem/,"Regulation is among the most important factors affecting bitcoin price. The cryptocurrency’s rise has been arrested every time a government has cracked the policy whip. For example, several observers attributed the recent crash in cryptocurrency markets to government action by South Korea and China. Bitcoin’s most recent price slump is being blamed on banks in India, which have tightened the screws on cryptocurrency exchanges. (See also: Bitcoin Regulation Around The World).

Two Important Questions

By their very nature, cryptocurrencies are freewheeling, not beholden to country borders or specific agencies within a government. But this nature presents a problem to policymakers used to dealing with clear-cut definitions for assets. Here are two unresolved questions relating to bitcoin regulation.

Who Should Regulate Cryptocurrencies?

Nothing is more symptomatic of confusion about cryptocurrencies than its classification by U.S. regulatory agencies. The CFTC treats bitcoin as a commodity while the IRS treats it as property.

But the difference in classification has not solved underlying problems relating to cryptocurrency taxation. “The problem is a technical one,” explains Perry Woodin, CEO of Node40, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company for cryptocurrency tax reporting. “It’s not possible to calculate your cryptocurrency tax liability without sophisticated software.”

According to Woodin, tracking the cost basis and days carried for the software needs a “deep understanding” of how blockchain works. “Simply recording transactions in an Excel spreadsheet is not sufficient for calculating tax liability (for cryptocurrencies),” he says. (See also: How The New Tax Law Affects Cryptocurrencies).

There is also a disparity in state and federal responses to the cryptocurrency. While states have moved with alacrity and formulated rules for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and smart contracts, the federal response to digital coins still has to move beyond platitudes about “working groups.” For example, FinTech startups in New York are required to obtain a BitLicense, which has stringent requirements regarding disclosures, before an ICO. Similarly, Arizona recognizes smart contracts.

How Should Cryptocurrencies Be Regulated?

The unique characteristics and global portability of cryptocurrencies presents another problem for regulators.

For example, there are broadly two different types of tokens being traded on exchanges. As their name indicates, utility tokens serve an underlying purpose on a platform. For example, Augur, which is a prediction market, is a utility token on ethereum’s blockchain. Such tokens are not subject to the SEC’s disclosure rules. On the other hand, security tokens represent equity or share in a company and fall under SEC purview.

Not surprisingly, several tokens have circumvented existing regulations by declaring themselves utility tokens. The agency’s chief has publicly rebuked such startups, but that has not stopped tokens with questionable business models from being listed on exchanges outside their native countries. The case of bitcoin exchanges in China, which promptly relocated to neighboring countries and Hong Kong following a trading ban, is also illustrative of the problems faced by regulators.

In response, international agencies such as the IMF have called for an international discussion and cooperation among regulators as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned. The EU, which has been welcoming of the cryptocurrency revolution, may possess an advantage over other territories because it controls a 28-member bloc.

In the United States, a non-profit, the Uniform Law Commission, formulated the Virtual Currency Businesses Act (VCBA) in an attempt to unify disparate state laws and provide entrepreneurs with “certain assurances with respect to the regulatory landscape.” But no state has committed to adopting VCBA, so far.

Dealing With The Bitcoin Regulatory Platypus

In an interview with American Banker, Marco Santori, head of blockchain practice at law firm Cooley, called bitcoin a “regulatory platypus,” one that doesn’t fit neatly into established asset categories. But the platypus may not be such a big problem for taxation purposes within the United States.

As Perry Woodin from Node40 points out, publicly-listed stocks are also managed by multiple agencies. “Government authorities can and should apply existing regulations to cryptocurrency,” he says. “But I don’t see a need to create cryptocurrency specific regulation.”

Some countries, notably in Asia, are pointers in ways to deal with cryptocurrencies. South Korea, where cryptocurrency trading is mostly tax-free, is considering revising that stance. The clearest indication of future policy regarding regulation may come from Japan, which legalized cryptocurrencies as legal tender in 2017.

The Japanese government passed a Virtual Currency Act, which defines and describes cryptocurrencies. They are treated as assets for accounting purposes. As part of the act, the government issues a list of approved virtual currencies, which are considered legitimate and can be transacted on (i.e., traded, sold, or promoted to the public). While there were concerns initially that altcoins might be left out of the official list, that has not happened.

Startups planning an ICO are also required to obtain a license that establishes a minimum set of requirements and disclosures for the offering. Finally, exchanges are also subject to capital requirements, strict IT compliance checks, and regulations pertaining to KYC (Know Your Customer). To achieve these changes, Japan amended its Payment Service Act. To be sure, the task is much easier in Japan since the country has only one agency, the Financial Services Agency, to operationalize the changes.

According to a new announcement from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), starting from Jan. 30, cryptocurrency investors in South Korea will have to use real-name bank accounts in order to continue trading.

Once the rule comes into effect, investors can only deposit funds to trade cryptocurrencies if their name on the crypto exchange matches that on their bank account.

The move comes as part of the financial regulator’s push through a strengthened “know-your-customer” (KYC) compliance to curb cryptocurrency speculation. The FSC said in the release that the new rule is resulted from an inspection of domestic anonymous crypto trading accounts – assisted by six domestic banks, as well as the Financial Intelligence Unit – from Jan. 8–16.

In addition, the official announcement also established an anti-money laundering guideline for cryptocurrency exchanges, which outlines situations where exchanges should stay alert to potential illegal activity.

The statement said:

“Specifically, for users to make virtual currency transactions more than 10 million won per day or more than 20 million won for 7 days when depositing and withdrawing funds, this is the type of financial transaction you suspect for money laundering.”

The new rule also appears to have a wider affect on foreign nationals who had been using cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea through a virtual bank account. As the FSC’s announcement pointed out, minors and non-citizens will be restricted from the new name verification service.

So far, three major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea have said they are in line with the new mandate.

In an email response to CoinDesk, a representative from Coinone confirmed that it will enforce the change starting from Jan. 30. “Under the new requirement, six banks are preparing the real-name account linkage with exchanges. They are NongHyup, KookMin, Shinhan, KEBHana, IBK, and JB Bank. As for Coinone, our users have to be registered with NongHyup for the time being,” the company said.

In addition, in its official blog post, Korbit also said on Jan. 19 that the existing fund deposit method will be terminated and replaced this month. It added that users “must have a Shinhan Bank account registered under your legal name.”

According to a report from South Korean news agency Yonhap, the Bithumb exchange also said it will also enforce the new change as per the government’s requirement.

After years of enjoying the increased demand from cryptocurrency mining, GPU manufacturers have begun to signal they might not be too thrilled about miners overcrowding the market. Nvidia has requested retailers to take some measures to try and ensure its produces get into the hands of gamers, not miners.

Nvidia Tries to Protect Gamers

Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), the graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer, is asking retailers to limit the amount of graphics cards they sell to cryptocurrency miners. This is done in an effort to tackle extreme price gouging and sever supply shortages caused by the rising profitability of cryptocurrency mining.

A review of graphics cards distributes in Germany has found that four out of six retailers has put in place stricter limits on Nvidia’s Geforce brand over the past month. By limiting the number of cards per order to two or three, the manufacturer hopes to discourage cryptocurrency miners who buy in bulk, and have as many as possible reach gamers.

A Three Pronged Attack

Cryptocurrency miners are now squeezing gamers out of the GPU market in three major ways. First, ASIC manufacturers such as Bitmain buy an ever greater amount of chips from foundries such as TSMC, leaving less production capability for Nvidia. Second, the big mining farms reportedly get large quantities of GPUs directly from factories in China before they can even enter the market. Third, smaller professional miners buy cards in the hundreds from retailers or online, pushing the price up and preventing them from reaching gamers.

Nvidia spokesman Boris Böhles told the German tech magazine computerbase that: “For NVIDIA, gamers come first. All activities related to our Geforce product line are targeted at our main audience. To ensure that Geforce gamers continue to have good Geforce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers’ needs as usual.” Still, Nvidia stresses that retailers do not have to follow this “recommendation,” as the manufacturer does not want to intervene in the freedom and independence of traders.

Talking at the Davos world economic forum, UBS Chairman Axel Weber, said that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were speculative, risky and “not an investment we would advise”.

“Retail clients, who don’t fully understand these products, should be protected from going into these products, because if there is a retail client affected in the future, the question will be again who was the bank that sold them these products and then banks will be blamed again for what has happened,” Weber told CNBC.

UBS’s comments echo those recently made by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who said he would never invest in cryptocurrency despite bitcoin’s nearly 2,000% rise in 2017.

Consultancy Ernst & Young also warned Monday that so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), which offer cryptocurrency tokens to raise funds, were at risk of cybercrime. Of the 372 ICOs analysed, raising a total of $3.7bn, roughly $400m had been stolen by hackers, who were taking up to $1.5m in ICO proceeds per month.

Q&A What is an ICO? Show An initial coin offering (ICO) is when a new cryptocurrency company offers a portion of its tokens for sale all at once to jumpstart trading, raise funds for continued development and earn a return on investment for its founders. The name is analogous to an IPO, or initial public offering – the moment a privately-held company first lists its shares on a public stock market. But, as financial regulators will tell you, the similar names doesn't mean they have similar legal statuses, and companies running ICOs have to be very careful not to imply they're selling an investment in their business. Still, that hasn't stopped some companies making a killing by offering their cryptocurrencies for sale. Filecoin, a blockchain-based data storage company, raised $237m in its September ICO, while Tezos, which aims to create a competitor to more established cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum, raised $232m in July. Still, the prize for chutzpah has to go to Bancor, which raised $153m in its June ICO for its cryptocurrency that powers a decentralised application for running ICOs.

The warnings of theft from ICOs come as the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton, said the agency had seen “disturbing” evidence that investors in ICOs had been counselled that they did not need to comply with federal securities law.

“I have instructed the SEC staff to be on high alert for approaches to ICOs that may be contrary to the spirit of our securities laws and the professional obligations of the US securities bar,” Clayton said.

The statements of governments around the globe suggesting regulation is on the horizon have led to the vast cryptocurrency price fluctuations that have seen bitcoin halve in value since its high of just under $20,000 in December.

Bitcoin trading was down approximately 12% over the last 24 hours, trading at around $10,400 on Tuesday morning on the Bitstamp exchange, following news that South Korea – the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency market – would implement its planned ban on use of anonymous bank accounts in cryptocurrency trading from 30 January.

South Korean Financial Services Commission vice chair Kim Yong-beom said that the new measures will prevent those residing outside South Korea who do not have local bank accounts and minors younger than 19 from buying or selling bitcoins and other digital currencies. The move forms part of the country’s action to curb cryptocurrency trading, including the raiding of local exchanges over money laundering, with the government looking at a potential ban on trading.

Local investors remain bullish, however, with one South Korean trader identified only as Ahn telling Reuters that “everyone knew this was coming, as the government already said they will enforce the real-name system before.

“Rather, I can see this as a chance to go in, not out. I don’t see any reason to take my money out”

Beyond simple trading, the hype in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has also caused concern, as companies seek to take advantage of investor buzz. Firms including camera-maker Kodak, fintech firm LongFin, power firm Digital Power, tobacco company Rich Cigars, tiny US drinks firm Long Island Iced Tea Corp and many other smaller companies have all seen their share price rocket through pivots towards cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology.

The SEC said it would begin scrutinising public companies that change their name or business model in a bid to capitalise upon the hype surrounding blockchain technology.

“The SEC is looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalise on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology and whether the disclosures comply with the securities laws, particularly in the case of an offering,” said Chairman Jay Clayton on Monday.

The yo-yoing in value of bitcoin, ethereum and ripple, among other cryptocurrencies has led economists to warn that the cryptocurrency bubble could be bursting.

“When it will fully burst is anyone’s guess and prices could yet rise again, before they fall further ahead,” Capital Economics warned in a recent research note. “Triggers for the bubble to burst could be a further crackdown by regulators or a major hacking attempt.”",2018-01-23,https://money.usnews.com/investing/cryptocurrency/articles/2018-01-23/bitcoin-gbtc,"According to Bernstein analyst Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, it is nearly impossible to determine an accurate valuation for bitcoin. (Getty Images)

Bitcoin investors are excited about the potential disruptive force that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology be in the global payments industry. Unfortunately, that disruptive potential doesn’t necessarily make bitcoin a safe bet for long-term investors.

According to Bernstein analyst Inigo Fraser-Jenkins, it is nearly impossible to determine an accurate valuation for bitcoin, which makes the cryptocurrency an extremely risky investment. Fraser-Jenkins also says arguments that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies should be considered a new asset class are flawed.

Investors get no cash flow from bitcoin, which makes it impossible to value using equity and bond valuation methods. It also has no interest rate, which makes it impossible to value using fiat currency valuation methods.

In addition to valuation hurdles, Fraser-Jenkins says questions over market liquidity, security, live pricing and blockchain forks are concerning for both institutional investors and regulators. Those arguing cryptocurrencies are a new asset class say their lack of price correlation with other asset classes can provide value for investors. Fraser-Jenkins says cryptocurrencies' extreme price volatility mitigates much of that potential benefit.

Finally, Fraser-Jenkins says bitcoin may soon face social backlash over the environmental impacts of cryptocurrency mining. Both institutional and retail investors are embracing environmental, social and governance standards and investing only in assets that are socially responsible. Due to the massive amount of energy that is needed to mine bitcoin, Fraser-Jenkins says it would likely be flagged by many funds as an environmentally irresponsible investment.

“The very significant power consumption may attract the attention of regulators, but even before that, we cannot imagine that any pension fund which has stated an ESG goal … would be able to allocate to bitcoin in any way because of this point alone,” Fraser-Jenkins says.

Bitcoin bulls often compare the cryptocurrency to gold, but Fraser-Jenkins says there are simply too many unknowns for institutional investors to responsibly include cryptocurrencies in their allocations.

“Despite our desire to have a more open approach to what is included within an asset allocation decision, we think that at this stage cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin in particular, do not have a role to play as an asset class,” Fraser-Jenkins says.",2018-01-23,https://news.bitcoin.com/giant-european-bank-confirms-bitcoin-ban-for-employees/,"Northern European Bank Nordea Confirms Bitcoin Ban for Employees

As News.Bitcoin.com learned two weeks ago, one of Europe’s largest banks, Nordea, will enact a company-wide policy to effectively ban its employees from owning or trading in cryptocurrency. Citing risks and perhaps looming regulation, the bank decided to act preemptively.

Nordea Bank Bans Bitcoin for Employees

Most of the 31,000 Nordea Bank employees by Spring won’t be allowed to own or trade in cryptocurrency, according to a bank-wide policy to be enacted at the end of next month. One of Northern Europe’s largest banks, Nordea has had a tenuous relationship with bitcoin over the last few years. Its present executive team is on record as either being dismissive or openly hostile to decentralized digital currency.

Barely two weeks ago, a company whistleblower reached out to News.Bitcoin.com to explain the bank was indeed considering such a move, upsetting some employees. This week the bank confirmed to mainstream media sources such as Reuters and Bloomberg the policy was indeed being enacted.

Nordea spokeswoman told Reuters by email, “The risks are seen as too high and the protection is insufficient for both the co-workers and the bank.” Employees who hold the currency as of the ban won’t be asked to sell them. The bank is, however, recommending they do exactly that, sell.

The bank explained to Bloomberg, “Given these high risks, and in line with our role in the banking industry to maintain high standards of conduct, Nordea is not supportive of staff investing in cryptocurrencies,” citing the standard worries about volatility and supposed criminal usage.

Clients and Rivals

Nordea was forced to address the issue of advising clients who’re interested in the crypto boom, insisting, “it’s important to emphasize that it is not something we recommend our customers to invest in. Just like every other bank trading platforms, Nordea Investor provides access to trade all securities listed on, for example, Nasdaq,” meaning “self-services customers can purchase cryptocurrency-related products through the platform, but it is important to emphasize that it is not something we recommend.”

Without much fanfare, large Northern European rival, Danske Bank, has done roughly the same sans complete prohibition: “We’re skeptical toward cryptocurrencies and are advising our employees not to trade them, but we don’t impose an actual ban. We’re currently analyzing the situation and time will tell whether there’ll be a formal ban.” As for its clients, “Due to lack of maturity and transparency in the various cryptocurrencies, we have decided not to provide trading of such securities on our various investment platforms,” Danske clarified.

Still, some experts view such seemingly drastic moves as really just banks hedging against inviting regulators to crackdown on the industry. Nordea’s ban, then, could be seen as less a blow to cryptocurrency and more a boon to self governance.

Whatever the case, Nordea’s exact way to monitor its employees was not revealed.

Running a major cryptocurrency exchange can be a logistical nightmare, but the rewards make it all worthwhile. In information released to shareholders this week, Coinbase revealed that it recorded turnover of $1 billion last year, which works out at an astonishing $2.74 million a day or $2,000 a minute.

Coinbase Coins It In

As America’s largest bitcoin broker, Coinbase claims the lion’s share of the money that’s pouring into the crypto space at a dizzying rate. 2017 was a bumper year for all crypto exchanges, which reported record numbers across the board: new signups, new staff hired, new trading pairs, and new revenue. Those revenue streams have turned into a torrent that has caused Coinbase’ coffers to swell.

Recode reports that the company’s revenue exceeded $1 billion last year, most of it derived from the trading fees it levies. These vary from between 0.25% and 1%. and quickly add up: in the past 24 hours, 36,000 BTC were traded on Coinbase, accounting for more than 15% of the total market. Coinbase isn’t the world’s largest exchange (and is technically a broker rather than a conventional exchange – that duty falls to its GDAX subsidiary) but it’s the best known and carries great weight in the cryptocurrency industry.

Coinbase Shares Are Hot Property

It’s not just cryptocurrency that’s in demand from Coinbase: investors are also seeking shares in the company itself. A number of existing investors report having fielded enquiries from buyers interested in snapping up their shares. There’s just one problem: Coinbase is doing everything in its power to prevent that from happening.

“As a private company, Coinbase does not allow trading of stock on secondary markets for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is not full and equal information available to the market,” read a company statement. “We will take appropriate action if we find people have sold Coinbase shares in violation of our agreements not to do so.”

The company is widely expected to launch an IPO at some stage. Traditionally, these public offerings are prefaced by a VC round for accredited investors. But having raised $100 million last year, and then seen record turnover of $2.74 million a day, Coinbase isn’t exactly strapped for cash. As a result, investors are scrambling to engage in secondary trades in a bid to claim a piece of the pie while they still can. With over 13 million customers bringing in more than a billion dollars a year, Coinbase would appear to have no need for private equity, no matter how eager investors are to part with it.

Though Mr. Buckley praised blockchain technology (aka distributed ledger technology), the core technology behind Bitcoin, he is not comfortable with Bitcoin, as he believes that it has no underlying economic value.

“You will never see a fund from Vanguard on bitcoin,” said Tim Buckley.

He added: “We tend to stay away from assets that don’t have underlying economic value. They don’t generate earnings or cash flows.”

The value of Bitcoin skyrocketed last year. In 2017 alone, Bitcoin gained 1400 percent, but its value today is half that of its peak in mid-December – currently, it’s struggling to maintain its price above $10,000.

Though Bitcoin is highly volatile and returned excellent value to early investors, producing a new generation of millionaires, Mr. Buckley said that as the digital coin does not have any underlying economy or generate any cash flow, the gains are purely based on speculation.

“The bitcoin – its value is based off of scarcity – and an artificial scarcity that’s out there. It’s really tough to imagine where the long-term return comes from other than speculation,” explained Mr. Buckley.

Even in a series of tweets recently, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman explained the speculative nature of Bitcoin and noted: “…If people come to believe that Bitcoin is worthless, well, it’s worthless. Its price rise has been driven purely by speculation…”

Mr. Buckley also pointed out that Vanguard does not even have a fund backed by precious metals like gold, as they are also devoid of any underlying economic value.

Despite Vanguard Group’s stand on Bitcoin funds, many asset managers are very positive about the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs. But due to the SEC’s recent hardline rules, many firms withdrew their submitted proposal for Bitcoin-backed ETFs.

Even though the SEC is not barring the introduction of the ETFs, it has set the entry barrier so high that it is practically impossible to introduce a profitable fund.

After sitting untouched in his account for years, 50 Cent’s earnings are now worth $7 million to $8.5 million, based on the current fluctuating bitcoin valuation.

Yet, despite the fraud and wild price swings, even Wall Street pros are seeing an opportunity to make money. Bitcoin futures — allowing traders to bet on future price moves, up or down — are now available on major exchanges. Meanwhile, one leading idea for how regular people might be able to invest in cryptocurrencies broadly has been through “exchange-traded funds” or ETFs — low-cost vehicles typically designed for retail investors who want to diversify risk, say by investing in an industry, not just one specific stock or currency.

There’s just one problem. Wall Street’s top regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has now pumped the brakes on the ETF idea. In a new statement, the agency laid out five key risks to cryptocurrency investing that will need to be addressed if Wall Street wants to create these ETFs.

“There are a number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors,” the agency wrote in its letter.

Here are the five big risks and what you need to understand about them before dipping your toes into the cryptocurrency investing waters.

1. It’s too hard to figure out how much a given cryptocurrency should be worth

The first risk outlined in the SEC’s letter is “valuation,” or the imperfect art of trying to figure out what a given investment should be worth.

With cash-generating assets like businesses or publicly-traded stocks, investment pros generally use ratios between a stock’s price and some other metric such as profits, growth, or cash flow. This is especially important if you, like Warren Buffett or his predecessor Benjamin Graham, are a so-called “value investor,” meaning you seek out assets specifically because they are already worth more than people realize.

But even those investors more focused on future growth — the allure of companies like Tesla — can do the math to determine a valuation that makes their investment smart, at least given assumptions.

A major problem, some argue, is that unlike companies that generate cash, cryptocurrencies cannot be valued or assessed in this way — they can only be “priced” and traded like other global currencies. And they are not yet mature or stable — or “liquid” — enough to be traded with much confidence.

What is liquidity?

2. Bitcoin and other cryptos are still tricky to trade

The great irony of bitcoin is that its popularity has arguably robbed it of what was supposed to be an essential function: paying for things digitally. The payments processor Stripe recently ended support for bitcoin, writing that the booms and busts have made the cryptocurrency “less useful for payments.”

It’s not always easy to sell something that might be 30% more or less valuable tomorrow. All the activity is also ramping up transaction times — to an average time of 78 minutes in December, according to CNBC.

One of the SEC’s concerns, according to its letter, is that digital currencies aren’t “liquid” enough to be included into licensed funds, which have to keep a certain percentage of their money in assets that can be sold quickly if investors want their cash back.

3. Cryptocurrency is too easy to misplace

Another downside to storing so much value in mysterious algorithms few people understand is that it’s kind of hard to figure out where to store your money — literally. Take the case of U.K. resident James Howells, who claims to have tens of millions of dollars in bitcoin stored in a hard drive that was accidentally buried at the bottom of a local dump.

Funds that buy stocks, by contrast, are required to have what’s called a “custodian,” someone who holds the stock through a mix of digital or physical records and verifies transactions. As the SEC notes, fund managers are required to use licensed custodians, essentially middlemen, to hold funds as intermediaries to limit the risk of loss or theft. You could also buy stock from the company directly.

Figuring out how to safeguard funds without needing middlemen is a key ambition of digital currency proponents like the makers of Ethereum, which focuses on so-called “smart contracts.” Geoffroy Van der Hasselt/Getty Images

Currently, there aren’t any licensed custodians who specialize in ensuring the quality of digital currency transactions. To be sure, this is one of the main problems digital currencies are aiming to solve, particularly through the smart contracts being developed on Ethereum. But according to the SEC, the technology isn’t there yet.

“How would a fund... validate existence, exclusive ownership and software functionality of private cryptocurrency keys and other ownership records?” The SEC wrote. “To what extent would cybersecurity threats or the potential for hacks on digital wallets impact the safekeeping of fund assets...?”

4. Investors in a crypto ETF could be at a disadvantage

The SEC worries that the structure of ETFs is mismatched with the way that cryptocurrencies currently trade — a misalignment that can be taken advantage of (the economic term is “arbitrage”) in a way that might hurt investors who lack the absolute most recent information.

Specifically, regulators fear digital currencies might be even more susceptible to arbitrage because of their relatively low volume (meaning a little bit of buying and selling can change the price a lot) and wild price swings (the price of bitcoin swung 30% or more in a single day six times 2017).

There’s also the fact that some of the biggest bitcoin exchanges have been abruptly shut down. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange with more than $1 billion in revenues last year, according to Recode, has been plagued by reliability problems: Back in December, the exchange had to shut down twice in one week as eager buyers overwhelmed the site, requiring new maintenance.

To address the problem, the SEC wants to see some kind of mechanism that can account for volatility and more — asking, “How would the shutdown of a cryptocurrency exchange affect the market price or arbitrage mechanism?”

5. Cryptos are susceptible to hacking and other scams

Digital currencies have had lots of problems with hackers over the years, with some of the largest exchanges becoming targets. If you’ve accumulated a lot of bitcoin, you’ve hopefully taken some precautions, like using cold storage through a paper or hardware wallet — though a recent study from researchers at the University of Edinburgh identified a number of security flaws with these hardware methods, too.

Indeed, the SEC’s fifth argument against digital currency funds is sort of a combination of the previous ones: Without addressing these issues regarding valuation, liquidity and custody, digital currencies carry an increased risk for fraud compared to other investments.

Take, for example, the prevalence of “pump and dumps.” As noted in a recent Outline report, social media-enabled schemes — where in-the-know individuals buy a tiny cryptocurrency en masse to raise the price, then immediately sell it for a gain — are increasingly common. This is pretty much exactly how the so-called “wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort made his fortune, buying up tons of super-cheap stock on unregulated exchanges, driving up the price and then dumping them on unsuspecting customers who didn’t know any better.

None of these issues are irresolvable. The SEC’s letter could even be viewed as a vouch of confidence in the underlying project: The commission keeps pretty busy, so if it is making time to outline how digital currencies might be better sold to retail investors, that is arguably a way of saying the technologies have promise.

But still, the SEC’s caution is a reminder: If you’re going to trade digital currencies, you should be doing so with “fun money” you can lose — not your actual savings — at least until these five issues are better dealt with.

Payment processor Stripe is halting bitcoin support. Declaring that “there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense,” the online payments specialist is calling it a day on cryptocurrency for the time being. Over the past month, a handful of other companies have also rolled back bitcoin support, usually citing high fees which make micropayments impractical.

Bitcoin Gets the Boot

Stripe is a $9 billion company run by Irish siblings and youthful entrepreneurs Patrick and John Collison. Stripe had been very receptive to cryptocurrency, and were it not for rising transaction fees, bitcoin would still be very much part of its plans. In a blog post published on Tuesday, project manager Tom Karlo explained the reasons for the volte-face:

Our hope was that Bitcoin could become a universal, decentralized substrate for online transactions and help our customers enable buyers in places that had less credit card penetration or use cases where credit card fees were prohibitive. Over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.

Karlo points to bitcoin’s current volatility, noting that by the time a transaction has been confirmed, BTC’s USD value has already changed, often discernibly. This is coupled with the fact that “For a regular bitcoin transaction, a fee of tens of U.S. dollars is common, making bitcoin transactions about as expensive as bank wires.”

Back in 2014, Stripe had written that “Bitcoin has huge potential as a way to transport value. It’s surprisingly difficult to move money today, and the experience of paying for something online is just about the only part of the internet that hasn’t changed dramatically in the past twenty years….we can already start to see the shape of the potential impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. If we get things right, life is going to be much better for billions of people.”

In halting bitcoin payments, Stripe follows on the heels of Microsoft, which halted and then restored BTC acceptance, and online gaming store Valve. Despite having to bid goodbye to bitcoin for the time being, the Stripe team remains bullish about cryptocurrencies. Tuesday’s blog post expresses enthusiasm for the Lightning Network, stellar, litecoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, and omisego.

It ends: “We will continue to pay close attention to the ecosystem and to look for opportunities to help our customers by adding support for cryptocurrencies and new distributed protocols in the future.”

It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot when discussing bitcoin and cryptocurrency, but it’s not necessarily one that is well understood.

When the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto first outlined those concepts in bitcoin’s 2008 white paper, he created a technology that could revolutionize money, data storage, trust and transactions forever. As the hype around bitcoin dies down — slipping from its mid-December highs of nearly $20,000 to a current price of $11,231 — it could be blockchain that outlives the cryptocurrency.

Proponents of blockchain tout its “trustless” structure, which has huge potential for other applications. It has the benefits of decentralization, where you’re not held ransom to a single party, while also removing the need to trust random miners, because the rest of the network has to agree on the updates. Rob Gowers and Jukka Aminoff, academics from Anglia Ruskin University, explained it in an essay published on The Conversation as such:

The beauty of blockchain is that something can be unique and stored digitally with ease, without needing an equivalent in the real world. For example, things like contracts, wills, deeds and share certificates might only require a piece of code stored on the blockchain that represents the exchange. Instead of a trusted intermediary verifying transactions, the computers of the shared network of bitcoin users themselves perform the verification at no cost to those involved in the transaction.

It’s best to think of the blockchain as a distributed ledger, a kind of shared, incorruptible digital record book that keeps track of every transaction. All activity conducted with bitcoin is held in this public record, available for everyone to see. It’s held on computers all over the world, meaning there’s no central server to hack or attack.

When a new transaction is made, it’s written into a block, which is linked to the most recent block and updates the ledger. This means there’s a network-wide consensus about which transactions took place when, and attacking one host would fail to make a change to the network that gets distributed across the board. It also means that once a block is added to the chain, it can never be changed.

In the case of bitcoin, “miners” set computers to work powering this network by verifying transactions on the network, bundling them up, linking it up to the previous block using advanced cryptography, and then trying to solve what’s called the proof-of-work problem. This is to show the amount of work done to find a hash that’s acceptable, and it’s meant to be difficult as a way of showing that the miner used a good amount of processing power.

Their reward for the hard work comes in the form of bitcoins, giving them an incentive to power the blockchain. It’s not the only way to run a blockchain, and it’s been criticized as energy-wasteful, but it helps explain how a blockchain works in practice, and it points to how there are applications far beyond what bitcoin has become.

Blockchain could revolutionize a number of seemingly familiar ideas. Everipedia, which counts Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger among its supporters, aims to put an encyclopedia on the blockchain, creating a decentralized repository impervious to blokcing.

Siglo enables phone users in developing markets to receive free data allowance exchanged on the blockchain by displaying ads on the phone. ParagonCoin uses the blockchain to store information about cannabis distributors, enabling applications like supply chain tracking to store lab and harvest data.

It’s not just individuals and businesses exploring the potential. Estonia’s e-Residency initiative, which has already signed up over 27,000 people from 143 countries in a virtual form of citizenship since its 2014 launch, also has big plans for blockchain. The system enables members to set up businesses, raise capital and more in a secure government-backed program. Kaspar Korjus, director of the initiative, outlined three possible crypto tokens in December that could benefit e-Residency. One of these, the “identity estcoin,” uses the blockchain to securely verify a user’s identity in online transactions.

The agency accused Randall Crater, Mark Gillespie, as well as My Big Coin Pay, Inc., of taking customer funds and transferring that money into their personal accounts. Additionally, the defendants allegedly used those funds “for personal expenses and the purchase of luxury goods.”

According to the CFTC statement, the defendants misappropriated more than $6 million from their customers, with those funds having been solicited between 2014 and 2018. The defendants were also accused of mischaracterizing the true nature of the project, including claims that it was backed by gold holdings and that it had a partnership with MasterCard.

My Big Coin’s website offers a number of cryptocurrency-related services, including the ability to buy and sell as well as mine the “My Big Coin” cryptocurrency. A blog on the site hasn’t been updated since last June.

CFTC enforcement director James McDonald said in a statement:

“As this case shows, the CFTC is actively policing the virtual currency markets and will vigorously enforce the anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act. In addition to harming customers, fraud in connection with virtual currencies inhibits potentially market-enhancing developments in this area.”

The suit was originally filed on Jan. 16 but had been kept under seal. Last week, the agency filed two other lawsuits against alleged cryptocurrency fraudsters but that third one – which was disclosed at the time – had yet to be revealed.

Three people entered the offices of Canadian Bitcoins in Ottawa carrying handguns and restrained four employees on Tuesday morning, according to CBC News. At that point, they attempted to compel one of the employees to make an outbound transaction from the exchange. A fifth employee called police before any assets could be taken, police told the news service.

One suspect has been arrested and charged, according to police. The charges include robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement.

The names of the suspects were not released.

CBC News reported in a Facebook post that the suspects were looking for physical cash, but other armed robberies have successfully made off with cryptocurrency wallets.

The New York District Attorney’s Office filed armed robbery and kidnapping charges against New Jersey native Louis Meza after he allegedly stole more than $1.8 million of ether last November. In the filing, the DA’s office claimed Meza held his victim at gunpoint, forcing him to turn over a cell phone and private keys, which he used to access the victim’s digital wallet.

And as of today Robinhood will let all users track the price, news, and set up alerts on those and 14 other top crypto coins, including Litecoin and Ripple.

“We’re planning to operate this business on a break-even basis and we don’t plan to profit from it for the foreseeable future” says Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev. “The value of Robinhood Crypto is in growing our customer base and better serving our existing customers.”

By essentially using crypto trading as a loss leader instead of its primary business like Coinbase and other apps, Robinhood could substantially expand beyond the 3 million users it already has. Simplifying trading and tracking could bolster Bitcoin and Ethereum. And by combining it with traditional stock, ETF, and option trading in a single app, Robinhood could further legitimize the cryptocurrency craze. The two trading worlds could cross-pollinate, dragging even more people into the crypto scene.

Many of the startups dealing in crypto are upstarts with questionable track records. But five-year-old Robinhood has raised $176 million from top investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Index, and NEA that now value the company at $1.3 billion. There’s clear long-term benefit to rolling up crypto traders and using the feature as a wedge to get them to hold money with Robinhood where it earns interest, and pay for the Robinhood Gold premium tier for $6 to $200 a month that lets them borrow between $1,000 and $50,000.

Here’s how Robinhood Crypto works. You can instantly transfer up to $1000 from your connected bank account (more if you have a Gold membership), with additional funds coming over slower ACH transfer. For smaller traders, that could eliminate the annoying delays on other platforms that can make you miss a low price you want to buy up. The whole Crypto section of Robinhood is styled with an 80s Tron design to denote the 24-hour trading window, compared to its day and night themes for when traditional stock markets are open or closed.

When you place a buy or sell order, Robinhood gives you an estimated price, connects to a slew of trading venues, exchanges, and market centers to find the lowest price, and uses its economies of scale to improve to score better prices over time. To counter market volatility, Robinhood puts a “collar” around your trade so if it can’t execute it at close to the estimated price, it waits for the price to return or lets you know.

And in case the price of a coin skyrockets or plummets, you can place limit orders to set a price where you automatically buy or sell. The full list of coins you can track is Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Zcash, Monero, Dash, Stellar, Qtum, Bitcoin Gold, OmiseGo, NEO, Lisk, and Dogecoin.

Only BTC and ETH will be available for trading when that rolls out to waves of users starting in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and New Hampshire in February, though more will be added. “We’re extremely selective about the cryptos we’re making available on the platform” says Tenev. “We’re introducing those first because these are the most mature coins that people are trading these days. Multiple times people have declared them dead and they’ve come back stronger than ever.”

To back-up the new Robinhood Crypto feature, the company is adding new two-factor authentication options including integrations with authenticator apps to ensure people don’t get their wallets stolen and dumped. “There are several senior world-class people that we’ve hired recently that are building the system in-house” says Tenev. Still, the move paints a giant target on Robinhood’s back. If the company gets hacked, or individual users get robbed, it could tarnish the fintech startup’s reputation.

Demand for the product was clear, though. 100,000 of Robinhood’s users were regularly seaching for crypto pricing and trading in its app, and 95% of those surveyed said they’d invest in cryptos if the product supported it. Robinhood even had to send a cease-and-desist to “Cobinhood”, a competing crypto trading app that cribbed its name and raised $10 million in an ICO.

Judging by the choices of two top startups, you could see this week as a sign of cryptocurrency’s shifting purpose. Yesterday Stripe removed Bitcoin as a payment option on its platform, and now Robinhood is adopting trading. “People are thinking about cryptos less from a payments standpoint and more from an assets investment standpoint” Tenev explains.

As for whether he’s personally invested in the crypto scene, Tenev admits “I’m a dabbler, definitely, but I wouldn’t say that it’s all that significant.” But it’s a good fit for his business, which used a lean engineering team to drop stock trading fees to zero while competitors like Scottrade and E*trade can charge over $6 per trade to cover their marketing and expansive retail footprint with huge overhead. Now Robinhood has handled $100 billion in transactions, saving its users over $1 billion in fees.

“[Cryptocurrency] puts power that’s historically been held by financial institutions in the hands of the people. I think that lines up directly with Robinhood’s mission to democratize the financial system” Tenev tells me, concluding “We’re an established company and we can handle it”. The confidence to burst into the wild west of crypto could either tank his startup with a massive security fail or greatly boost its traction by alligning with what’s become a cultural phenomenon.

The prices of bitcoin and other digital currencies surged last year as investors, including some on Wall Street, bet cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology behind them could one day transform the world as much as the internet has. Bitcoin was developed as a way to send money around the world quickly and cheaply. However, transaction fees have soared above $20 and other digital currencies have yet to prove their actual use.

In addition to buying and selling BTC and ETH, Robinhood users will be able to track information about 14 more cryptocurrencies, from Litecoin to Ripple to Zcash to Monero and so on. Don't worry: Meme-inspired Dogecoin is also on the list.

Robinhood Crypto won't be available everywhere right away. During February, the product will roll out gradually to users in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, and New Hampshire.

He sees Robinhood's expansion as a boon for the cryptocurrency world: ""We can make it much more stable, much more reliable, and a much healthier ecosystem.""

Customers' cryptocurrency assets will be held in a combination of cold and hot storage (offline versus connected to the internet).

If you're tempted to join the cryptocurrency bandwagon, regulators say you should take a pause before you click ""buy.""

Following bitcoin's meteoric price rise in 2017 — from just under $1,000 in January to nearly $20,000 in December — there's been a rush to cash in on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that makes them possible.

Numerous investment vehicles have been created to meet this surge in consumer demand.

In December, bitcoin futures began trading on two exchanges, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the CME Group. In January, Kodak saw its shares rise on the announcement of its ""KodakCoin"" digital currency. Even Venezuela is making moves into digital money, with President Nicolas Maduro announcing the development of a ""petro cryptocurrency"" backed by the country's oil and gas reserves.

But where some see opportunity, regulators are preaching caution. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission shot down proposals from two exchange-traded funds seeking to offer investors a way to trade in cryptocurrencies on more traditional exchanges.

ETFs have exploded in popularity in recent years and offer a simple way for individuals to diversify their investments. The funds hold a basket of investments, and investors can then buy and sell the ETFs like normal stocks.

In this case, the two funds proposed investing in cryptocurrencies. They would allow investors to trade shares of the funds, with fund managers handling the selection and purchase of the underlying crypto assets in their portfolios.

Cryptocurrency markets feature ""substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in December.

For the SEC, cryptocurrencies are still too new and poorly understood to allow them onto more conventional exchanges.

But the agency's reluctance to allow crypto trading on stock exchanges has done little to curb investor enthusiasm. Aspiring investors can still trade bitcoin and other currencies on a host of online exchanges. (Earlier this month, bitcoin prices plummeted and it was trading at around $11,000 on Thursday.)

Investors can also participate in ""initial coin offerings,"" where new coin developers sell their digital coins in exchange for startup capital. Unlike traditional IPOs, most ICOs do not give investors a stake in the company. As a result, ICO curators claim that their activities fall outside of the SEC's regulatory authority.

The SEC is not so sure. ""Fraudsters may entice investors by touting an ICO investment 'opportunity' as a way to get into this cutting-edge space, promising or guaranteeing high investment returns,"" the agency said in an investor bulletin.

On Monday, SEC Chairman Clayton called out the financial advisers and lawyers behind many ICOs, saying ""they can do better.""

Crypto investors do not need to look far to see what the SEC is warning about. Last week, BitConnect, an online platform that guaranteed returns of up to 40 percent per month, collapsed.

BitConnect failed shortly after receiving cease-and-desist orders from authorities in North Carolina and Texas.

Some prominent figures in cryptocurrency, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and hedge fund manager-turned-crypto-investor Michael Novogratz, called this ""too-good-to-be-true"" venture a Ponzi scheme. Over the course of a few days, BitConnect's coin lost more than 90 percent of its value. Investors were left with no way to withdraw their funds as the platform announced that it was shutting down. Those who could found that their investments had shriveled to a fraction of their initial value.

The problem isn't limited to BitConnect. New research from Ernst & Young reveals that over 10 percent of the funds generated by ICOs are either misplaced or seized by hackers. These attacks exploit flaws in the code of new cryptocurrencies, many of which are rushed to market without meaningful review. It's often impossible to recover stolen funds because blockchain transactions are irreversible. According to Ernst & Young, this 10 percent represents a loss of about $400 million in investor money.

Despite the risks, investors continue to flock to ICOs and projects that utilize blockchain technology. Even famously contrarian billionaire Mark Cuban is getting on board, with his announcement last fall of a $25 million investment in the esports-betting cryptocurrency Unikrn. Speaking to crypto newsletter CoinDesk, Cuban called the ICO opportunity ""a perfect fit.""

As for BitConnect, representatives of the company have not responded to multiple NPR requests for comment. But they have announced that they are still going forward with an ICO for a new project, BitconnectX. Whether any investor will still trust them remains to be seen.

These days, the word is ubiquitous; the dramatic rise of bitcoin’s price raised the level of interest in that and other cryptocurrencies to amazing heights.

Now seemingly everyone wants to know more about cryptocurrencies, or just ""cryptos"" for short.

What Currency And Cryptocurrency Is

First, let’s look at the word itself. Digital currencies are secured using cryptography and combining that with their role as a currency gives us the compound word cryptocurrency.

To understand what a cryptocurrency is, rather than just the what the word means, you first must think a bit about the nature of a currency itself. Money, like cash money, is simply a token we use to exchange for goods and services. There is no inherent value in the pieces of paper we carry in our wallets, purses or pockets. It only has value because we believe it does.

In the modern age, however, there is no need for that token to be a physical one. For a long time now, many transactions have not involved the transfer of actual cash. Even before computers, writing a check meant allowing a bank to reduce your balance and increase somebody else’s by updating a ledger, and debit cards are a more modern version of that. No cash changes hands in these transactions.

Cryptocurrencies are in many ways just a version of that, updated to allow for the widespread use of the internet, but with a couple of crucial differences.

How Are Cryptocurrencies Different?

First, they are not issued by the government. They are created and controlled by computer programs, or algorithms. Those algorithms lay out how transactions are made and recorded, and how new coins or tokens are found and released. People and organizations known as miners keep records of every transaction and attempt to solve complex computer problems that, when solved, reward them with new coins as payment.

In effect, it is the users themselves and their vast combined computing power that record transactions directly between peers, rather than through banks or other intermediaries. That system is known as a blockchain and the transactions, and even the currencies, are sometimes referred to as “peer-to-peer.”

The second major difference, and one that must be understood to appreciate the value of cryptos is that, unlike conventional currencies, the total amount that can ever be in circulation is limited. Government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar are created at the whim of those who are in power. As the economy grows, more dollars are created to allow for that growth. Simple economics tells us that as the supply of something is increased, the value of each unit falls.

That explains why, for example, a house that cost a few thousand dollars a few decades ago will now cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. It is what is known as inflation, and conventional currencies work on an inflationary model.

Cryptocurrency, in contrast, works on a deflationary model. Because the total supply of the currency is restricted, you do not use more coins to pay for goods and services, but less. Something that costs one coin now will cost only a fraction of a coin in the future as the economy (the supply of goods and services) grows, but the number of coins in circulation remains essentially static.

Common Cryptocurrencies

The above concepts are hard for many people to grasp but the other bewildering fact is that there are over 1,300 cryptocurrencies in existence. Each has subtle differences, but the largest by market cap and therefore the most commonly used are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. Let's take a very quick look at each:

Bitcoin is the big daddy of cryptos and the one that most people are aware of. It was created in 2009 by the still mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. There are actually now two types of Bitcoin, the original and Bitcoin Cash which came about as a way of solving the high transaction times on the Bitcoin network.

Ethereum, also known by the name of its token, Ether, is similar in that it uses a blockchain, but was created more with an eye to what are known as “smart contracts,” rather than use by everyday consumers. Smart contracts replace the need for paper contracts between parties to an agreement and remove the need for signing and amending contracts written on paper.

Ripple is aimed at payments made between financial institutions. These payments have until now typically taken days to process and have been expensive, particularly when they involve low-value, high volume payments. The blockchain makes those transactions faster and cheaper.

Litecoin is probably the closest to Bitcoin in that it is designed as a general use currency. Adherents will tell you that it is an improved version, as it allows for a greater volume of transactions and performs them faster.

As we've seen, the price of all cryptocurrencies will fluctuate, often violently. Some, no doubt, will not survive, but with big companies and Wall Street institutions getting involved, it is clear that cryptos are here to stay.

Stephen Poloz, who heads up the Bank of Canada, said buyers of digital coins should ""beware"" and that he would not call cryptocurrencies assets. ""They are crypto but they are not currencies,"" Poloz told CNBC during an interview at The Sanctuary in Davos. ""I'm not really sure what they are.

Lars Rohde, the head of Denmark's central bank, called bitcoin investing ""deadly"" last year.

Many business leaders have also warned on the dangers of investing in bitcoin including J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon who famously called the cryptocurrency a ""fraud"" while investing legend Warren Buffett said the space will ""come to a bad ending."" Poloz told CNBC that if the cryptocurrency market, which is highly volatile, were to crash, it would not have bad implications on the wider economy. ""One parallel we could draw would be the tech wreck. When we had the tech wreck, that was a much more widespread exposure. And the fact it had barely had perceptible effect on the real economy because it was not a stock market crash but just a segment of the stock market.

""So I think if you take that experience to heart, if something like that were to happen in the cryptocurrency space, it would probably be smaller today … It certainly has the potential. I don't want to minimize the risk that you raised because any mania has the scope to get much bigger."" Poloz told CNBC that the central bank will look to regulate cryptocurrency. ""I have no doubt that at least for the purposes of consumer protection … We will be developing regulations around this space in due course. But what we are being careful to do here is to not stifle innovation,"" Poloz said.

Blockchain 'genius'

The Canadian central bank chief added though that blockchain technology which underpins cryptocurrency, is ""a true piece of genius and it will be applied to many many areas in the economy."" Blockchain is the underlying technology behind bitcoin. It acts as a public record of transactions that is tamperproof and requires no central authority to clear transactions. This technology is seen as a way to make a lot of businesses processes faster and cheaper.

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Cryptocurrencies are a hot topic these days. People all over the world are making thousands, if not millions, of dollars investing in these digital tokens. The potential returns, however, come with great risk and volatility. Before investing in cryptocurrencies you should definitely take the time to do your own research.

Below I've listed six things, both good and bad, about investing in these digital assets.

Related: How Digital Wallets and Mobile Payments Are Evolving and What It Means for You

1. Good: Potential returns can be massive.

Everyday you hear crazy stories about individuals making money with cryptocurrency. To put it in perspective, if you invested $1,000 in Bitcoin back in 2013 it would be worth over $400,000 today. A few alternative coins (altcoins) that have recently jumped into the top 10 tokens for market cap have seen increases of 1000 percent in the last few months.

2. Bad: Inexperienced teams.

Every cryptocurrency is essentially a startup building a product to solve a certain problem.

Cryptocurrencies are fairly new. There are a lot of teams with little experience in the space and not very many individuals with extensive knowledge and or experience. Just like a startup, if a team isn't properly managed the whole project can fall apart. Most projects will include information about the team. A quick LinkedIn search can show a lot in regards to their experience.

3. Good: Liquidity

When you invest in an asset like a startup, your money can be locked up for years. You're stuck, unless someone buys your equity or the company is acquired or goes public. No so with when investing in cryptocurrencies, where your investment is fairly liquid.

With cryptocurrencies you can buy and sell on the fly. Markets run 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Buys and sells are generally instant so you can react quickly when there is market fluctuation.

4. Bad: Technical difficulties.

The hardest thing for people to grasp when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies is the fact that it's all digital. You can equate nearly any other investment to something physical but you can't actually hold a Bitcoin in your hand.

Given that these assets are entirely digital you're often subject to technical difficulties. Markets and exchanges can get very slow when they are busy. Deposits and withdrawals are often disabled for certain tokens when the networks get congested. If you need to sell or move coins around at this time you're at the mercy of that exchange.

5. Sorta good: Transparency

This one you need to take with a grain of salt. Unless you're on the team, you can't know the full picture. Many of the major cryptocurrencies are very transparent with their undertakings. Most will give ample details on their whitepaper (a lengthy document explaining the project and technology) and other relevant materials. These typically include a roadmap, team members and often times their code.

The code is typically available on Github for others to publicly inspect. It's typically a bad sign when there is not much activity on a company's Github.

6. Bad: Security

Security is one of the biggest drawbacks of cryptocurrencies. Exchanges have been hacked and lost millions of dollars worth of digital tokens. Those who kept their coins on those exchanges lost close to everything.

Cryptocurrencies are not FDIC insured and won't be anytime soon. You need to be extremely careful when it comes to buying, selling and storing these coins.

I recommend using a cold storage wallet that lets you control your private keys. Your private key is what allows you to access your coin on the blockchain. It's best to keep this key offline and in a secure place.

Investing in cryptocurrencies is very risky. The markets are volatile and the technologies are still quite young. However, they are still a great opportunity for anyone interested in investing. Treat them as you would any investment and please do your own research.

Celebrities ranging from Floyd Mayweather to Paris Hilton are feeding into crypto-mania.

But due to its technical limitations, bitcoin is struggling under the weight of its own success.



Bitcoin isn't just a wildly speculative bubble struggling not to collapse under the weight of its own success. It's also a fashion accessory — if you're Katy Perry, that is.

Growing numbers of celebrities are lining up to praise the purported wonders of the cryptocurrency boom, and the pop star is joining their ranks. On Thursday, she posted a photo to her Instagram account of her nails painted with the logos of various high-profile cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin is there, along with its smaller sibling litecoin, as well as ethereum and the privacy-focused monero. The caption? ""$—CrYpTo ClAwS—$"".

And this isn't the first time Perry has used cryptocurrencies to promote her personal brand. Back in November 2017, she posted a photo of herself having a chat with legendary investor Warren Buffett. ""nbd just asking Warren Buffett his thoughts on cryptocurrency,"" she wrote.

nbd just asking Warren Buffett his thoughts on cryptocurrency A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Nov 29, 2017 at 12:24am PST Nov 29, 2017 at 12:24am PST

Media personality and businesswoman Paris Hilton has also got in on the crypto hype.

In September 2017, she publicly promoted the ICO, or initial coin offering (a mechanism for company fundraising that involves selling cryptographic tokens to investors, similar to an unregulated IPO), of a marketing-AI-blockchain platform called LydianCoin.

She quietly deleted her tweet, however, after attention was drawn to the fact that it was being led by a man previously convicted of domestic assault.

Boxer Floyd Mayweather was relatively early to the ICO game, hyping up prediction market Stox in July 2017. ""I'm gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 2nd on the Stox.com ICO,"" the boxer wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of him sitting on a private jet next to literal piles of money.

Stox went on to raise $30 million (£23 million) — and was subsequently promoted by another high-profile sportsperson on Instagram, Uruguayan footballer Luis Suarez. ""You can call me Floyd Crypto Mayweather from now on,"" Mayweather later told his followers.

The price of bitcoin — and other cryptocurrencies — has skyrocketed over the last 12 months, from less than $1,000 to highs of almost $20,000. But since then it has undergone a major correction, and is currently hovering around the $11,000 mark.

Bitcoin is under serious strain from all this attention. Due to technical limits on the number of transactions it can handle, the network is being overloaded, meaning payments can face fees of tens of dollars each and take hours to process — making it effectively useless as an actual day-to-day means of payment.

Some businesses that previously accepted bitcoin payment are not ending their support for the cryptocurrency, despite its popularity, because these issues make it too technically challenging to handle.

Gaming platform Steam removed it as a payment option in December 2017, and payments startup Stripe dropped it earlier this week, explaining: ""Empirically, there are fewer and fewer use cases for which accepting or paying with Bitcoin makes sense.""",2018-01-25 00:00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/25/bitcoin-wont-last-in-world-of-finance-warns-nobel-winning-economist,"The Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Shiller has said bitcoin will not be a “permanent feature” of the financial world, as politicians indicated that a clampdown on cryptocurrencies was coming.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Shiller hailed bitcoin as a “really clever idea”. But although he was impressed with the technology behind it, he was concerned that it had “gone viral as a currency”.

“I tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it’s not a permanent feature of our lives,” said Shiller, who has previously warned that the bitcoin price could collapse. “We are over-emphasising bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications.”

Theresa May said in Davos that she was concerned that criminals were taking advantage of digital currencies, which can be used to anonymously transfer funds. “In areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,” May told Bloomberg.

The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, also flagged up concerns about misuse of digital currencies. “My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “So in the US our regulations [say] if you’re a bitcoin wallet, you’re subject to the same regulations as a bank.”

South Korea has recently announced a clampdown on digital currencies. From next month, people will be banned from using anonymous bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading.

Digital currencies have been a key topic of conversation at Davos. Ethereum, a rival to bitcoin, has set up its own lounge on the main promenade of the ski resort. Banks are showing particular interest in the blockchain – the digital ledger that underpins a cryptocurrency.



A senior Swedish central banker said bitcoin was too volatile to be classed as money. “In my view, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin and the others, the way I’ve seen them so far, they don’t meet the criteria to be called money,” said Cecilia Skingsley, deputy governor of the Riksbank.

“They are not a very stable store of value – they fluctuate a lot – and it’s not a very efficient medium of exchange because you don’t buy your groceries with bitcoin, you don’t get your salaries in bitcoin, and you certainly can’t pay your taxes with bitcoin.”

Skingsley said she understood that digital currencies were attractive in countries where people did not trust the public authorities, but she said bitcoin was a “poor alternative” as it was too volatile.

“If you’re talking of money in an efficient economy, over time it’s much better if you have a trustworthy authority that releases enough money – not too little and not too much,” Skingsley said.

However, some investors at Davos disputed the idea that bitcoin faced a rocky future. Jennifer Zhu Scott, of Radian Partners, said bitcoin was a “very lousy currency” and a “very lousy payment system” but insisted that it worked as an asset. “I don’t think bitcoin is disrupting currency or money. Bitcoin is disrupting gold,” she said.

Zhu argued that bitcoin was extremely efficient as a store of value, as there could only ever be 21m in circulation – and only about 16m have been created so far.

Neil Rimer, a general partner at Index Ventures, conceded that bitcoin could theoretically crash to zero, but he also hailed the progress since it was created nine years ago. “This is one of the most audacious, generous and profound inventions that I have witnessed in my career. It does have the ability to help many, many people,” he said.",2018-01-25 00:00:00

A Japanese cryptocurrency exchange announced the theft Friday of $400 million in digital currency. Some estimates put the loss at the Coincheck exchange at over $520 million.

The stolen assets were stored in the cryptocurrency NEM, one of hundreds of digital currencies created in recent years. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, dropped precipitously on news of the hack but has since regained much of its value.

The incident could be one of the largest single losses of cryptocurrency ever, rivaling only the 2014 hack of online exchange Mt. Gox. Reports at the time put Mt. Gox's losses at over $400 million.

Coincheck says 500 million digital coins were lost. According to Cointelegraph, hackers stole the private key protecting access to Coincheck's accounts.

Japan's Financial Services Agency announced it is ""looking into"" the loss, while most activities on the exchange were suspended Friday. Coincheck said in a statement that the exchange is trying to ensure that consumer assets are protected.

As NPR previously reported, U.S. regulators are increasingly worried that cryptocurrency markets are vulnerable to manipulation and theft.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton warned in December that cryptocurrency markets have ""substantially less investor protection than in our traditional securities markets, with correspondingly greater opportunities for fraud and manipulation.""

The SEC had previously warned that investors may have ""limited recovery options"" in the event of a hack, as exchanges are often based outside of the United States.

Ian Wren is NPR's business news intern.",2018-01-26,https://www.coindesk.com/coincheck-confirms-crypto-hack-loss-larger-than-mt-gox,"Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has confirmed that it has suffered what appears to be the biggest hack in the history of the technology.

In a press conference at 23:30 JST (14:30 UST), the exchange’s president Wakata Koichi Yoshihiro and chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka estimated its loss at 58 billion yen (approx. $533 million). According to Bloomberg, which attended the conference, 500 million NEM tokens were taken from Coincheck’s digital wallets.

Tweets by Nikkei appeared to indicate that the precise amount stolen may not be fully known until further checks have been carried out into the intrusion.

But though the exact dollar figure for the incident is hard to pin down (given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and the company’s lack of information), data suggests the figure is now at least over $400 million, factoring for a decline in the value of XEM, the NEM protocol’s token, following the incident.

At press time, the price of XEM was $0.85, down from a high of $1.01 today, according to data from Coinmarketcap.

Notably, the dollar amount stolen from Coincheck is likely greater than the amount stolen from Mt. Gox in 2014 (pegged at $340 million), though the impact on the cryptocurrency market will be much smaller given the immense increases in market capitalization since.

Rumors had been circulating about the theft since early this morning when Coincheck abruptly froze most of its services.

The firm announced on its website around 13:00 JST (04:00 UTC) that it had restricted deposits, trading and withdrawal of XEM, the token running on the NEM blockchain.

A wider suspension on withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies as well as Japanese yen was announced around 30 minutes later. In the following hour, trading of all cryptocurrencies was also restricted, except bitcoin. According to the latest update, other deposit methods including credit cards have also been stopped.

Coincheck is looking into compensating its customers, its executives also announced.

It was also revealed that Coincheck was not registered with Japan’s Financial Services Agency, but now plans to do so. Coincheck’s president said he “deeply regretted” the issue.

CoinDesk is following this developing story.

Cryptocurrencies were one of the biggest topics at the Forum. There was an official session on it, CNBC ran a few panels about the subject in The Sanctuary, and there was even a dedicated spaced called Crypto HQ, which focuses on blockchain technology.

While the potential of blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, was praised, bitcoin got slammed.

""There is no intrinsic value for something like bitcoin so it's not really an asset one can analyze. It's just essentially speculative or gambling,"" Stephen Poloz, the governor of the Bank of Canada, told CNBC Thursday.

Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller told CNBC ahead of Davos that it may be around for 100 years, though it's more likely to collapse.

""(Bitcoin) might totally collapse and be forgotten and I think that's a good likely outcome but it could linger on for a good long time, it could be here in 100 years,"" Shiller told CNBC.

Bitcoin's reputation as a currency that is primarily used for illicit activities still lingered too.

""The fact that the anonymity, the lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism and all sorts of dark trades is just not acceptable,"" Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said during a panel talk in Davos earlier this week.",2018-01-26,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/huge-interest-in-robinhood-crypto-has-skeptics-worried-about-a-bubble.html,"For all the worries about it being a ""bubble,"" bitcoin has become a big business. As its price soared 2,000 percent in the 12 months through mid-December to above $19,000, Coinbase, the leading U.S. marketplace for trading major cryptocurrencies, more than doubled its userbase to over 13 million.

""I think it's buyer beware,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-founder and partner at Themis Trading. ""It's not a stock. It's not a security.""

That surge of interest has quickly brought out the critics: skeptics of bitcoin 's skyrocketing price and Robinhood's ability to provide fair prices for customers.

Just over 24 hours since no-fee stock trading app Robinhood announced it would roll out free digital currency trading in February, 530,000 and counting have signed up to ""get early access.""

Robinhood announced Thursday it is planning to use the same method it used to undercut online stock brokers by rolling out free bitcoin and ethereum trading in five states beginning in February.

And again, critics aren't sure that's a viable business model.

""Isn't this 100% about embedding the fees in either the bid-ask spread, currency exchange or both?"" Bill Gurley, general partner at Benchmark Capital, asked in a Thursday afternoon tweet. ""Almost certainly,"" replied Union Square Ventures partner Fred Wilson tweeted Thursday afternoon. He noted he was biased as an investor and board member at Coinbase, ""but I would prefer to know the fees vs. having them buried."" Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev responded by emphasizing Robinhood Crypto's aim of just breaking even, and said customers will see an estimated purchase price.

The bigger worry is that if bitcoin is a bubble, Robinhood making it easier to buy bitcoin will only fuel the mania.

Saluzzi pointed out that even though Coinbase's fees are ""enormous"" compared to the stock industry, they work because people are ""beating down the door to get in"" and expect ""400 to 500 percent return.""

In about two hours Friday afternoon, the waitlist on Robinhood Crypto jumped by more than 40,000 to 573,000.

The company has many other significant advantages over existing digital currency exchanges, some say. Users will also be able to manage their crypto, stock, options and ETFs trading from the same platform.

""Now there's one brokerage you can use for all of your investing,"" said Ryan Gilbert, partner at Propel Venture Partners, which is indirectly a minority investor in Coinbase. Gilbert is also personally invested in funds that have investments in Robinhood. ""It has done more to empower investors in the bitcoin space than any of their competitors could dream of doing.""

Coinbase didn't immediately respond to a CNBC.com request for comment on this article.

Robinhood also brings some sense of credibility to cryptocurrency trading since its stock-and-options trading arm is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Robinhood Crypto isn't a member and its website points out that ""cryptocurrencies are not stocks and your cryptocurrency investments are not protected by either FDIC or SIPC insurance.""

But if Coinbase was able to become a leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange with high fees, it's unclear what could stop Robinhood Crypto's growth.

Leigh Drogen, the founder and CEO of Estimize, a six-year-old company that collects and publishes financial estimates for data such as earnings, says Robinhood Crypto may ultimately pressure competitors to lower fees. ""They will burn this industry to the ground, cause a race to the bottom in fees, and take whatever is left.""

And Robinhood's slow phase-out in five states — Coinbase is in at least 36 — shouldn't be much of a deterrent to quality growth, Drogen said.

The Russian government is in the process of finalizing the federal law for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. The draft law has now been officially published. It regulates the creation, issuance, storage, and circulation of cryptocurrencies.

Legal Crypto Definitions

The Russian government has officially published the draft federal law entitled “On Digital Financial Assets” which regulates cryptocurrencies in Russia.

This draft law was introduced by the country’s finance ministry at the end of December. It was followed by much discussion and amendments to the bill before it was finally released to the public on Wednesday. Article 5 of the document states that “This federal law shall enter into force 90 days after the date of its official publication.” According to the document:

This federal law regulates the relations arising in the creation, issuance, storage and circulation of digital financial assets, as well as the exercise of rights and performance of obligations under smart contracts.

The draft law provides Russia’s official cryptocurrency-related definitions for the first time including the definition of cryptocurrency, tokens, smart contracts, crypto exchanges, and mining.

Cryptocurrency is defined as “a type of digital financial asset created and accounted for in the distributed registry of digital transactions by participants in this registry in accordance with the rules of maintaining the registry of digital transactions.” Meanwhile, a token is defined as “a type of a digital financial asset that is issued by a legal entity or an individual entrepreneur (hereinafter referred to as an issuer) in order to attract financing and is recorded in the registry of digital records.”

As for mining, it is deemed “an entrepreneurial activity aimed at creating a cryptocurrency and / or validation in order to receive compensation in the form of a cryptocurrency.” Mining activities are subsequently described as “legally valid” actions.

Rights to Exchange to Other Assets

The document clarifies that Russians have the right to trade their cryptocurrencies for other digital assets and for fiat currency, stating:

Holders of digital financial assets have the right to make transactions for the exchange of digital financial assets of one type for digital financial assets of another type and / or the exchange of digital financial assets for rubles, foreign currency and / or other property only through the exchange operator of digital financial assets.

“Citizens of Russia will be able to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and tokens only through professional participants of the securities market,” Forbes Russia emphasized.

Exchanges and Wallets

After providing the definition of cryptocurrency exchanges, the document proceeds to explain, as also previously reported by news.Bitcoin.com.

Operators of the exchange of digital financial assets can only be legal entities.

The exchanges must be “established in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation and carry out the types of activities specified in Articles 3 to 5 of Federal Law No. 39-FZ of April 22, 1996 ‘On the Securities Market’.” Alternatively, they can also be “legal entities that are the organizers of trade in accordance with the Federal Law of November 21, 2011 No. 325-FZ ‘On Organized Trading’.”

The document also puts restrictions on wallets. A wallet is defined as “a software and hardware tool that allows you to store information about digital records and provide access.” However, the draft law states that a wallet must be “opened by the operator of exchange of digital financial assets only after passing the procedures of identification of its owner in accordance with the Federal Law of August 7, 2001.”

Token Sales and Their Investors

A large part of the document addresses initial coin offerings (ICOs). It specifies rules for token sales such as the issuing procedures and what documents and information need to be disclosed prior to the sales. For each ICO, the issuer must also provide an investment memorandum containing all information related to the issuer and the tokens. The rules state:

An offer for the release of tokens, an investment memorandum, rules for keeping the register of digital transactions, as well as other documents…must be published no later than 3 working days before specified in the offer for the release of tokens.

Furthermore, tokens “may not be offered to potential purchasers in any form or by any means using advertising” prior to the publication of an offer for the release of tokens. In addition, the draft law imposes restrictions on non-qualified investors, stating:

Persons who are not qualified investors in accordance with the Federal Law No. 39-FZ of April 22, 1996 ‘On the Securities Market’ can purchase tokens in the amount of not more than fifty thousand rubles within a single issue.

Jackson racked up about 700 bitcoins after agreeing to accept digital currency as an alternative form of payment for his 2014 album ""Animal Ambition,"" according to TMZ. That stake is now worth over $7 million.

In a now-deleted Instagram post, the 42-year-old took to social media to congratulate himself. In a post referencing the original TMZ report, he wrote, ""Not Bad for a kid from South Side, I'm so proud of me."" He followed up with an additional comment saying, ""I'm a keep it real. I forgot I did that s---.""

The self-congratulations continued on Twitter.

The pat on the back is well deserved. At a time when bitcoin was only worth about $660 and yet to go mainstream, Jackson took a risk: He agreed to accept it as a form of payment. In a June 3, 2014, Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) on the same day his album was released, the hip hop mogul revealed that he made the decision in an attempt to ""stay with [the] times.""

The bitcoin that came in would have amounted to around $450,000 then. Since rising in value to around $11,200 per bitcoin according to Coinbase, that same stake would be worth closer to $7.8 million now.

Word of the abusive ads started no later than Tuesday, as people took to social media sites to complain their antivirus programs were detecting cryptocurrency mining code when they visited YouTube. The warnings came even when people changed the browser they were using, and the warnings seemed to be limited to times when users were on YouTube.

Great now my browser everytime I watch youtube... my anti virus always blocking coinhive because malware . Idk much about it but this is getting annoying and I need a solution please T n T — Arung (@ArungLaksmana) January 23, 2018

Por lo visto @YouTube es muy gracioso y no le bastaba con bajarnos la audiencia, ahora van y nos meten el JavaScript de Coinhive para utilizar nuestros dispositivos para minar Monero! De verdad, @Google! Que leeches estáis haciendo con YouTube?? pic.twitter.com/NzMUMlArJs — ᛗ🦊ᛟErvoᛟ🦊ᛗ (@Mystic_Ervo) January 24, 2018

On Friday, researchers with antivirus provider Trend Micro said the ads helped drive a more than three-fold spike in Web miner detections. They said the attackers behind the ads were abusing Google's DoubleClick ad platform to display them to YouTube visitors in select countries, including Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain.

The ads contain JavaScript that mines the digital coin known as Monero. In nine out of 10 cases, the ads will use publicly available JavaScript provided by Coinhive, a cryptocurrency-mining service that's controversial because it allows subscribers to profit by surreptitiously using other people's computers. The remaining 10 percent of the time, the YouTube ads use private mining JavaScript that saves the attackers the 30 percent cut Coinhive takes. Both scripts are programmed to consume 80 percent of a visitor's CPU, leaving just barely enough resources for it to function.

""YouTube was likely targeted because users are typically on the site for an extended period of time,"" independent security researcher Troy Mursch told Ars. ""This is a prime target for cryptojacking malware, because the longer the users are mining for cryptocurrency the more money is made."" Mursch said a campaign from September that used the Showtime website to deliver cryptocurrency-mining ads is another example of attackers targeting a video site.

Advertisement

To add insult to injury, the malicious JavaScript in at least some cases was accompanied by graphics that displayed ads for fake AV programs, which scam people out of money and often install malware when they are run.

The above ad was posted on Tuesday. Like the ads analyzed by Trend Micro and posted on social media, it mined Monero coins on behalf of someone with the Coinhive site key of ""h7axC8ytzLJhIxxvIHMeC0Iw0SPoDwCK."" It's not possible to know how many coins the user has generated so far. Trend Micro said the campaign started January 18. In an e-mail sent as this post was going live, a Google representative wrote:

Mining cryptocurrency through ads is a relatively new form of abuse that violates our policies and one that we’ve been monitoring actively. We enforce our policies through a multi-layered detection system across our platforms which we update as new threats emerge. In this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms.

It wasn't clear what the representative meant when saying the ads were blocked in less than two hours. Evidence supplied by Trend Micro and on social media showed various ads containing substantially the same JavaScript ran for as long as a week. The representative didn't respond to follow-up questions seeking a timeline of when the abusive ads started and ended.

As the problem of Web-based cryptomining has surged to almost epidemic proportions, a variety of AV programs have started warning of cryptocurrency-mining scripts hosted on websites and giving users the option of blocking the activity. While drive-by cryptocurrency mining is an abuse that drains visitors' electricity and computing resources, there's no indication that it installs ransomware or other types of malware, as long as people don't click on malicious downloads.

A few years ago, if you had mentioned the term “cryptocurrency” to me, I would have imagined some kind of currency involving an underworld banking system, with hooded traders sitting behind shady computers.

We now read about it not only in the business sections of daily websites or financial publications, but on their front page. Entire sections of news publications are becoming devoted to things like Bitcoin.

Jurisdictions around the world are scurrying to put into place legislation and regulations to allow or make it easier for companies to carry out initial coin offerings [ICO’s] or token issuances. Is “cryptocurrency” even the right terminology? Or should it be “digital currency”? “Virtual currency”?

So, the question which we must now ask ourselves: whatever we call it, do cryptocurrencies, really deserve this much attention. Should we care this much? What will the impact of crypto be in the long term?

What is it again?

In essence, cryptocurrency is – as blockchain based platforms are meant to be – completely decentralised. As a financial based blockchain, that means it is not governed by any central bank or monetary authority. It is rather maintained by a peer-to-peer community computer network made up of users’ machines or “nodes”. If you know what BitTorrent is, the same principle applies.

Using blockchain, it is effectively a digital database – a “distributed public ledger” – which is run via cryptography. Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is secure as it has been digitally confirmed by a process called “mining”. Mining is a process where all the information entering the Bitcoin blockchain has been mathematically checked using a highly complex digital code set up on the network. That blockchain network will confirm and verify all new entries into the ledger, as well as any changes to it.

Note that while it is fundamentally anonymous, the mathematics behind it makes it a global public transaction ledger, so every transaction can ultimately be traced through cryptography.

Why is it so important?

First, note there are various types of cryptocurrencies, and for the purposes of this piece, I’ll focus on easily the most mentioned and used: Bitcoin [BTC] and Ether [ETH].

Bitcoin was the very first blockchain – a financial one – created by an individual [or group, who knows] called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Its value has exponentially increased to a ridiculous level: you may have seen pieces swirling around the Internet such as “if I had brought $100 of bitcoin back in 2010, I’d have over US$100 million now” or about Bitcoin’s first billionaires. An increasing number of retailers and internet sellers are beginning to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment.

Without going into too much detail, while Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin, its uses extend beyond the mere financial side of things such as mining, into the provision of services on its own particular blockchain. Ethereum provides built-in software programming languages which can be used to write, for example, smart contracts that can be used for many purposes, including the transfer and mining of its own tradeable digital token, Ether [which is even more complex than Bitcoin].

Prior to Christmas 2017, the cryptocurrency space went through a process called “mooning”. That is to say, their prices went utterly and completely ridiculously sky high. It became the absolutely wrong time to buy crypto. Because just before Christmas, the entire market utterly crashed, losing approximately 20% of its entire global market cap.

It then bounced up. And then in mid-January, crypto exchanges again crashed, with prices in Ethereum for instance falling approximately 25%.

So, the headlines. Regulators issuing “buyer beware” notices [certainly needed, but also because many central regulators struggle with the notion of regulating a decentralised technology]. Investing in initial coin offerings (ICO’s) and in cryptocurrencies is highly speculative and basically you can lose all your money.

And you can indeed. Of course, you can say the public shareholders of Lehman Brothers also did, but unquestionably cryptocurrency exchanges are far more volatile than the stock markets.

But cryptocurrency is important and it is not going away, or be limited to 100 years as others may speculate: transactions are fast, digital, secure and worldwide, which in essence allow the maintenance of records without risk of data being pirated. Fraud is, actually, minimized.

Also, as an aside, digital currency such as Bitcoin should not result in inflation. The total number of bitcoins which can ever be mined is limited to approximately 21 million, so there is no way the total amount of cash in the system can be increased by any central bank. Bitcoin itself is, by its nature, scarce… though one can certainly argue that cryptocurrencies themselves, are infinite as they can be generated by anyone.

Should I really care?

Many large banks are now spending money either collaborating with existing crypto clients [JPMorgan with Zcash] or developing their own cryptocurrency [such as Bank of America].

Whenever I get asked, “Should I think about buying any cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum?”, I tend to answer along the following lines [and note, I’m by no way an investment advisor, nor in any position to give any investment advice, so none of this should be considered any]. Basically, do you have any spare money? Do you like to speculate in a fairly volatile investment [and I use the word “fairly” being polite]? Have you ever been to Las Vegas? If so, welcome to the Crypto Casino.

As mentioned, the cryptocurrency markets are currently all over the place. While that is the case one should bear in mind this: outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum, there are a number of high quality digital token and coin issuers, with excellent backers and management, with very good AML procedures in place, a great business model, etc.

Yet indeed, there are also numerous completely awful ICO’s which are taking place.

Hence, the need for regulator “buyer beware” notices. You really do need to do your research before investing.

In terms of importance, one other key item to note is that as cryptocurrencies become more widespread, it is really the decentralised ledger technology, blockchain, upon which crypto is based, which is the true masterpiece.

Blockchain is just a platform, and its technology allows those cryptocurrencies and their digital tokens to operate within it. Essentially, any transaction capable of being recorded can look to the use of blockchain, whether they be medical records, immigration information, birth certificates, insurance policies – all of that data can be stored and guaranteed over a blockchain.

The use of smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain – protocols allowing the self-execution of contracts once certain conditions are met – will eventually become headline news as well.

Conclusion

It really does need to be taken into account that crypto is a form of currency that has been in existence for approximately only 10 years. It isn’t gold and it isn’t fiat. This is brand new technology which has already illustrated its ability to fundamentally disrupt the global financial system. But it isn’t perfect by any stretch.

Crypto, or digital, or virtual currencies have created a paradigm shift in the way we look at money. The way we look at potentially buying it. The way we look at potentially spending it.

Just be careful buying it.

""I don't believe that bitcoin is going to be a currency today or in the future,"" Schultz said, during a post-earnings conference call Thursday after the closing bell on Wall Street. (Shares of Starbucks were under pressure on Friday after another quarter of disappointing sales growth as holiday offerings failed to draw in customers.)

Instead, Schultz told investors he sees potential in blockchain, the online ledger technology underlying digital currencies. ""I'm talking about ... the possibility of what could happen — not in the near term, but in a few years from now — with a consumer application in which there's trust and legitimacy with regard to a digital currency.""

""I'm not bringing this up because Starbucks is announcing that we are forming a digital currency or we're investing in this,"" Schultz said, according to audio of the call on the Starbucks website. ""I'm bringing this up ... as we think about the future of our company and the future of consumer behavior.""

Last month, Schultz told CNBC he could see a future in which the U.S.-based coffee chain would be cashless one day. He joined Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. He served twice as CEO, a role he turned over to Kevin Johnson last April.",2018-01-26

Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck said on Sunday it would return about 46.3 billion yen ($425 million) of the virtual money it lost to hackers two days ago in one of the biggest-ever thefts of digital money.

That amounts to nearly 90 percent of the 58 billion yen worth of NEM coins the company lost in an attack that forced it to suspend on Friday withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin.

Coincheck said in a statement it would repay the roughly 260,000 owners of NEM coins in Japanese yen, though it was still working on timing and method.

The theft underscores security and regulatory concerns about bitcoin and other virtual currencies even as a global boom in them shows little signs of fizzling.

Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) sent a notice to the country's roughly 30 firms that operate virtual currency exchanges to warn of further possible cyber-attacks, urging them to step up security.

The financial watchdog is also considering administrative punishment for Coincheck under the financial settlements law, one of the sources said.

Japan started to require cryptocurrency exchange operators to register with the government only in April 2017. Pre-existing operators such as Coincheck have been allowed to continue offering services while awaiting approval. Coincheck's application, submitted in September, is still pending.

Coincheck told a late-Friday news conference that its NEM coins were stored in a ""hot wallet"" instead of the more secure ""cold wallet"", outside the internet. Asked why, company President Koichiro Wada cited technical difficulties and a shortage of staff capable of dealing with them.

In 2014, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing around half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins. More recently, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit last month shut down and filed for bankruptcy after being hacked twice last year.

A bill has been submitted to the Russian parliament to make the country’s national “cryptocurrency,” the cryptoruble, legal tender in Russia. This bill was introduced as the finance ministry published a different bill for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings in Russia.

Cryptoruble as Legal Tender

A draft law has been submitted to the State Duma by Parliament member Rizvan Kurbanov to introduce “the national cryptocurrency, cryptoruble, as an official means of payment in Russia,” RT reported. The publication elaborated:

The document proposes several amendments to the Russian Civil Code, which would make the cryptoruble a legal means of payment circulated nationwide.

The bill was posted in the electronic database of the lower house of parliament on January 25. It proposes amending Article 140 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation to include the cryptoruble on the list of legal means of payment in Russia.

“The cryptoruble is a digital financial asset (cryptocurrency) – an analog of the ruble, which has circulation in the territory of the Russian Federation,” the document describes, adding that it “is protected by cryptographic methods and used by participants in the distributed registry of digital transactions.”

Kurbanov also wrote that “Adoption of the submitted draft federal law will not entail additional costs from the federal budget and does not require changes in other financial obligations of the state.”

Will Cryptoruble be Launched Soon?

In October 2017, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin ordered the issue of the country’s national cryptocurrency, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

Following his order, the Minister of Communications and Mass Media, Nikolay Nikiforov, quickly proposed the basics for the new currency. Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia, the finance ministry, and the State Duma have been discussing the framework for the cryptoruble.

Both the central bank and the finance ministry indicated that they are in no hurry to create the national cryptocurrency. While deputy finance minister Alexei Moiseev said “I do not even understand what a cryptoruble is,” the central bank’s first deputy governor Olga Skorobogatova said the idea of the cryptoruble is not advisable from the macroeconomic point of view. However, she revealed that the bank is working on a “supranational digital currency within the BRICS or the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEC).”

Last week, The first deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, Sergey Shvetsov, emphasized that “The appearance of a cryptoruble in the foreseeable future is unlikely.” However, early this month, Putin reiterated the need to create the cryptocurrency and reportedly commissioned work to create it in order to circumvent Western sanctions.

Meanwhile, the finance ministry has published the draft law for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) in Russia.

The issue became apparent earlier in the week as complaints surfaced on social media claiming that YouTube ads were raising red flags in anti-virus software. A service called Coinhive was hijacking a viewer's CPU and using its power to mine crypto.

SEE ALSO: CryptoCelebrities are the newest irritating kid on the blockchain

A Friday blog post from Trend Micro, an international cybersecurity company, confirmed the sharp uptick in Coinhive use earlier in the week, pinning it to a ""malvertising campaign"" that subverted a Google ad service used on YouTube.

""Attackers abused Google’s DoubleClick, which develops and provides internet ad serving services, for traffic distribution,"" the post notes. Trend Micro's data pointed to Japan, France, Taiwan, Italy, and Spain as the countries affected by the campaign.

In a statement given to Ars Technica on Friday, Google confirmed the cryptojacking threat, noting that ""[i]n this case, the ads were blocked in less than two hours and the malicious actors were quickly removed from our platforms.""

Google's ""blocked in less than two hours"" timeline doesn't add up, however. Trend Micro's data suggests that ""an increase in traffic to five malicious domains"" from DoubleClick advertisements started on or sometime before Jan. 18. By Jan. 24, the company had detected ""an almost 285% increase in the number of Coinhive miners.""

Google didn't respond to any follow-up questions regarding the timeline.

Coinhive wasn't always used for nefarious purposes. The script was created originally to let website owners harness the processing power of a visitor's computer to mine Monero. So long as the site owner let people know about Coinhive up front and didn't let the script monopolize processing power, it was a relatively ethical way for website operators to turn traffic into income.

Then, in late December, users of a certain Chrome extension discovered that it was also secretly running CoinHive. This incident quickly turned into one of the higher profile examples of a relatively new phenomenon in the malware world: ""cryptojacking,"" the practice of hijacking a PC user's CPU to mine cryptocurrency.

The spread of cryptojacking to YouTube is an alarming development. While it's good that Google eventually shut the activity down, this is a new wrinkle in the cryptocurrency craze that internet gatekeepers will have to better protect against in the future.",2018-01-27,https://news.bitcoin.com/discover-cards-44-million-customers-denied-crypto/,"Discover Card's 44 Million Customers Denied Crypto

The credit card company crypto squeeze continued this week with Discover Card announcing it would not allow its customers to use their card on cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s the latest in a string of credit card purveyors to block access.

Discover Card Removes Doubt: No Crypto

Discover CEO David Nelms, 56, told Jennifer Surane, “It’s crooks that are trying to get money out of China or wherever. Or if someone steals our credit card numbers they’re going to ask for payments in Bitcoin. Those are the only use cases I’m actually seeing today,” he dismissed, giving a decided thumbs down to cryptocurrency as a phenomenon. It’s “not like our customers are clamoring to use it.”

Discover Card holders were known to stalk online forums asking about other users’ experience with attempting to buy cryptocurrency on exchanges. The answer was clear: not possible. Mr. Nelms has removed all mystery with the above statements. Discover wants no part in the burgeoning market of decentralized money.

The company has been around in one form or another for over three decades. With 44 million customers, Discover ranks in the top five popular US credit cards behind Visa, Mastercard, and American Express.

What’s in Your Wallet?

It’s hardly the only credit card to publicly come out against cryptocurrencies. In fact, Capital One recently tweeted “We currently decline credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. We’ll continue evaluating our policy as this market evolves.” In a follow up, Breitbart was able to get a more expansive comment:

“Capital One is currently declining credit card transactions to purchase cryptocurrency due to the limited mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss, and volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Capital One continues to closely monitor developments in cryptocurrency markets and exchanges and will regularly evaluate the decision as cryptocurrency markets evolve.”

Both of these come after Visa basically shut down huge European markets, leaving many crypto enthusiasts without much recourse.

One theory, beyond fear of eventual competition, is government regulations and liability, with regard to anti-money laundering laws and know your customer onboarding, make it too risky for credit card companies and banks to participate in crypto.

Whatever the case, Discover’s Q4 earnings fell short of analysts’ projections, and its profits dropped by over thirty percent, presumably unrelated to their prohibition on digital assets. Sooner or later, however, in freer economic arrangements, customers make known their preferences, and 44 million users being denied a chance to experiment with bitcoin and other digital assets could quickly demand alternatives.

Others have made more — and less.

Gotman, 19, began researching cryptocurrency almost five years ago. Then, a little more than two years ago — after researching the legality of the currency, among other things — he dove in and has not looked back.

“Cryptocurrency is the modern stock market,” he said.

Gotman said investing in cryptocurrency is easy. He said all a person needs is knowledge of the currency and a cryptocurrency wallet that links to your bank account.

The Herkimer County Community College student said he is planning to continue investing in cryptocurrency and plans on selling some of the currency he has and then using that money to reinvest in other cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, has skyrocketed recently as more people invest in it and are making money — though experts warn of potential downfalls.

And understanding what exactly cryptocurrency is can be difficult to the newcomer.

Bitcoin was among the first cryptocurrencies founded — though it is not the only one. Cryptocurrency is digital currency that is decentralized, with no central authority backing it, and is used as a peer-to-peer payment system.

“They are not backed by any government or legal entity,” said Mehmet Sencicek, an associate professor of economics at Utica College.

Sencicek said cryptocurrency originally was developed to be used as a method of payment, but currently is being treated as an investment — much like stocks and bonds. He said the appeal of the currency is that it is highly liquid, has a low transaction cost and can be sent almost instantaneously.

There are several ways a person can acquire bitcoins. One is by mining — which requires a user to use their computer's processing power to solve a complex mathematical problem. Sencicek said the problems are getting harder and harder to solve and could create an issue when the problems get too hard to mine.

People also can purchase bitcoins (and other cryptocurrency) from online exchanges where it is sold like other commodities.

Gotman said he uses the website and app Coinbase and the Cryptocurrency exchange site Bittrex. He said people can spend however much they want on the various currencies, though some sites and exchanges do have rules as to how much must be purchased.

Retailers also can acquire bitcoins by accepting them as payment for their goods.

Ocean Blue restaurant in Utica is one of the area establishments that accept digital currency.

Francis Pezzolanella said the restaurant has taken cryptocurrency since Thanksgiving. Ocean Blue accepts Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Etherum.

“Most people are intrigued by it,” Pezzolanella said.

The restaurant advertises the cryptocurrency use via social media, at the restaurant and on the check. All managers have the Bitpay app on their phone to facilitate the transactions.

Pezzolanella said the restaurant has handled about a dozen transactions with bitcoin and a half dozen with litecoin — with most transactions around $100.

The restaurateur — who invests in cryptocurrency — is aware that with the fluctuation in price, Ocean Blue can easily be overpaid or underpaid on a given tab.

“It’s a risk you take,” Pezzolanella said.

Sencicek does not think cryptocurrency has been fully established as a payment option.

“It hasn’t established its value yet,” he said.

The value of cryptocurrency is very fluid. Much like the stock market, it fluctuates according to outside factors. These factors can include how many people want in on the currency, what major corporations are allowing it to be used as payment — thereby adding legitimacy and making it more mainstream — and whether or not it is regulated by the government.

Sencicek said the U.S. government said it would not regulate, though that could change. South Korea, China and Russia have come out and said they would regulate cryptocurrency — which caused a recent drop in value, Sencicek said.

The fluidity of cryptocurrency doesn’t concern Gotman. He fully understands that there will be familiar patterns of prices skyrocketing and then crashing.

“It wouldn’t be much of a loss if I lost it,” Gotman said of his investment.

Perth Mint, Australia’s largest gold refiner, has announced plans for the development a cryptocurrency backed by physical gold. If successful in developing the altcoin, it will join a long list of virtual currencies seeking to entice cryptocurrency investors to experiment with commodity-backed virtual currencies, including Venezuela’s soon to be launched ‘petro’.

Australian Gold Refinery to Develop Cryptocurrency

The chief executive of Perth Mint, Richard Hayes, states that the company has identified a significant opportunity in “bring[ing] investors back to precious metals after a boom in alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies,” the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports.

“I think as the world moves through times of increasing uncertainty, you’re seeing people look for alternate offerings,” Mr. Hayes stated, adding “And you’re seeing this massive flow of funds into the likes of Bitcoin at the moment because people are looking for something outside of the traditional investments.”

Perth Mint CEO Claims Metal-Based Crypto Potentially Offers Price Stability

Mr. Hayes explained Perth Mint’s decision to develop a gold-backed cryptocurrency, emphasizing the purported benefits of using distributed ledger technology for fast and efficient settlement, whilst potentially affording the cryptocurrency greater price stability than unbacked virtual currencies. The CEO stated that “us[ing] precious metals to back something […] allied to blockchain […] retains its intrinsic value,” adding that unbacked cryptocurrencies “rely on everyone believing that there’s something behind it.”

“With a crypto-gold or a crypto-precious metals offering, what you will see is that gold is actually backing it,” Mr. Hayes stated. “So it will have all the benefits of something that is on a distributed ledger that settles very, very quickly, that is easy to trade, but is actually backed by precious metals, so there is actually something behind it, something backing it.”

Commodity-Backed Cryptocurrencies Proliferate

If successful in launching the cryptocurrency, Perth Mint’s altcoin will join a long list of virtual currencies purporting to be backed by gold. Last year, the initial coin offering (ICO) for Onegram – a purportedly Shariah-compliant, gold-backed, cryptocurrency – garnered significant international media attention for what the company hoped would be a more than $500 million USD token-sale.

At the closure of the first phase of the ICO, Onegram only saw the sale of 16,926 of the 12,400,786 Onegramcoins (OGC) that the company had hoped to sell – comprising less than 0.14% of the company’s goal. Presently, Onegram claims that the platform is still in development, and has given its investors the option to resell their OGC for a meager 25% return should they wish to liquidate their holdings.

Venezuela also recently announced that it will launch a commodity-backed cryptocurrency, the ‘petro’ – a national cryptocurrency purportedly backed by 5 billion barrels of Venezuelan crude oil. In recent weeks, Venezuelan officials have urged neighboring countries to adopt the cryptocurrency. At present, it appears as though the Venezuelan government will seek to sell the crypto in “private placements at a discount of up to 60 percent,” with the sale set to start of February 15.

There are nearly 400 homes listed for sale on Bitcoin-RealEstate.com, a brokerage website specializing in the nascent digital currencies, which are known for volatile fluctuations and a fair amount of risk. Of those, there are 15 properties listed for sale in California and one other in the Bay Area: an undeveloped seaside bluff near Half Moon Bay.

But, it was certainly a first for real estate broker Sean Beattie of Realty Experts. He’s been a licensed broker in the Bay Area for 17 years, he said, and has seen boom after bust after boom. But, he’s never seen listings for homes being exchanged for the cryptocurrency locally, he said. So, when the seller, Alec Wang, requested to sell his property at 2559 Oliver Ave. for bitcoin, litecoin and other digital currencies, Beattie didn’t quite know how to respond.

“I was unsure,” he recalled. “I contacted (our legal department) to see if I could even do that.”

They said yes, and so far, the response from would-be buyers has been overwhelming, Beattie said. It’s not unusual to get dozens of calls and emails inquiring about a property as soon as it’s listed, especially not in the red-hot Oakland housing market. But, the type of response has been unlike anything he’s ever seen, he said. After listing the property on Friday, calls and emails have been coming in “every five minutes” from Italy, China and elsewhere across the globe.

“I’ve never had so many people calling from out of the area, who have no idea where Oakland even is, except that it’s close to San Francisco,” Beattie said. “They saw ‘bitcoin’ and that’s it.”

Wang isn’t sure how to take the response — whether it’s due to the cryptocurrency offer or is just a product of the Bay Area’s insane, demand-driven housing market. It’s a first for him, too, he said.

At an open house on Saturday, a few would-be buyers admitted they hadn’t heard of the bitcoin offer prior to arriving. But, that doesn’t mean some didn’t think it was a good idea.

“This is really cool,” said Angel Tiensovan. She’s a financial consultant for Telegraph Hill, she said, and is in the market for a new home. She’s seen more financial markets gravitate to the digital currencies in recent years, she said. “This is the direction a lot of foreign markets are going.”

But, that doesn’t mean she’s planning on purchasing the property with one of the nascent currencies.

“As high-tech as I am, I’m still old school in certain ways,” Tiensovan said.

A Fremont native, Wang is no stranger to buying and selling homes and office buildings. As the founder and president of Tana Investment Group, a real estate investment firm, Wang’s portfolio extends up and down the West Coast. He had seen the rise of bitcoins and cryptocurrencies in other industries — and in the real estate industry in other countries — but hadn’t seen anyone offering to accept them for property sales locally, he said.

So, he decided to take the plunge and try it out.

“I try to stay in the lead in terms of how trends are going, and I try to understand new technology,” he said. “There’s a lot to figure out, but I’m willing to be the test case.”

In all likelihood, the buyer will probably convert the cryptocurrency to cash to pay the real estate broker’s commission, along with the title agent and taxes, Wang said. But, eventually, he expects the process to become much more seamless.

But what to do with the wild volatility of the digital currencies? In a market where the value of bitcoin can fluctuate 30 percent in the span of a few hours, Wang said it will be essential to settle on a dollar amount for the price of the house and then agree to an exchange rate at closing. The four-bedroom, two-bath, recently remodeled house not far from the Oakland Zoo is listed at $648,000.",2018-01-27,https://news.bitcoin.com/george-soros-bitcoin-propped-up-by-dictators/,"George Soros: Bitcoin is Propped Up by Dictators

Legendary currency trader, hedge fund titan, philanthropist George Soros, 87, delivered his yearly talk at The World Economic Forum 2018 in Davos, Switzerland. At the end of his remarks, an audience question asked the mogul his thoughts on cryptocurrencies generally and bitcoin in particular.

George Soros Believes Bitcoin’s Bubble is Maintained by Dictators

A balding moderator chose to read from an audience question. He asked Mr. Soros, “Somebody says, ‘You’re a currency speculator. What do you think of cryptocurrencies? Is bitcoin a bubble, and do you have a position in cryptocurrencies?’”

Mr. Soros grinned, looking every bit of his approaching 90 years old, and seemed to acknowledge the obvious grin spreading across the room and his face. “Well,” he laughed while scratching his head momentarily, “cryptocurrency is a misnomer, and it’s a typical bubble which is always based on some kind of misunderstanding.”

His currency speculation isn’t like most. Mr. Soros’ currency moves have damn near sacked entire economies. Just ask the Bank of England. Or most of Asia at one time or another. Currency? You can say he knows a little something, yes.

Stammering to collect his next thought, Mr. Soros clarifies, “Bitcoin is not a currency. A currency is supposed to be a stable store of value. And a currency that can fluctuate twenty five percent in a day can’t be used, for instance, to pay wages because wages could drop twenty five percent in a day. So, it’s a speculation based on a misunderstanding,” he stressed.

Bitcoin for Tax Evasion

Whether he truly understands the technology and just why its volatility could be a feature rather than a bug is beyond the scope of present reportage. But he is aping the legacy party line, “There is also a very innovative blockchain technology which can be used for positive or negative purposes,” he said almost as an afterthought.

“Currently [bitcoin] is used mostly for tax evasion and the … for the … people in the … the rulers in dictatorships to build a nest egg abroad. Recently, just now, there was a conference where instead of discussing conditions in Russia, they mainly discussed bitcoin because that’s what the rulers were interested in,” Mr. Soros explained, incredulous. Indeed, world leaders have been unusually vocal about cryptocurrency the last few weeks, and the subject is dominating much of the financial press.

“So this will have a big effect on the valuation of bitcoin. Normally when you have a parabolic curve,” he held his left hand like a karate chop, “eventually it has a very sharp break. But in this case, I think, as long as you’ve got dictatorships on the rise, you will have a different ending because the rulers in those countries are going to turn to bitcoin to build a nest egg abroad.”

It’s hard to know what in particular he is referring, but guesses include North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and maybe even Russia. Scant evidence exists they’re actively participating in hording bitcoin, but at least one is creating its own version.

“So I expect instead of an abrupt break, another flat top over … but it’s nevertheless a bubble, typical, which is always based on a misunderstanding like the tulip mania. But the blockchain technology can be put to positive use. And we use it, actually, in helping migrants to communicate with their families and to keep their money safe,” he concluded. No follow-up questions came with regard to just how migrants are using blockchain to communicate nor secure their money.

He never did answer as to whether he has a position in cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin transactions provide anonymity to users and so has been used for criminal activity such as buying illicit items on the dark web. It also provides anonymity for scammers as the virtual currency does not pass through any banking institution and consumers cannot stop payment like they can with a credit card. Cyberfraud, drug dealing, prostitution, gun-running and other major crime profits are being ploughed into the internet currencies. Drug pedlars are using high street bitcoin ATM machines to deposit cash from deals, and there are 77 such ATMs in Britain.

Gangsters are not only hiding money from the police, they are also making fortunes from the rise in the value of virtual currencies, according to the Met Police.

The following are some questions and answers about one of the largest heists of cryptocurrencies in the history:

WHAT IS NEM?

NEM is a cryptocurrency launched in March 2015 by a team of five developers identifying themselves as Pat, Makoto, Gimre, BloodyRookie and Jaguar. Its acronym stands for New Economy Movement and, like other cryptocurrencies, markets itself as a digital coin outside the control of governments and central banks, which can be used for fast, global transactions.

It is now the tenth largest cryptocurrency, with $9 billion worth of NEMs in circulation, trading at just below $1 per coin.

NEM was launched to rectify the high concentration of wealth that some in the cryptocurrency community believe to be one of the key weaknesses of bitcoin, the world’s most widely known cryptocurrency, whose early adopters have turned into multi-billionaires.

For bitcoin transactions to clear, computers compete to find the solution to a computational problem, which NEM developers say makes the rich richer as those who have money can afford more hardware to solve such problems.

NEM rewards accounts that participate in the economy. The balance of an account, who transacts with that account, and how much it transacts with others are all combined to calculate an account’s importance, based on which transactions are cleared.

HOW WAS COINCHECK HACKED?

Many details are still unclear.

Yusuke Otsuka, Coincheck’s chief operating officer, said on Friday that around 523 million NEM coins were sent from a NEM address at Coincheck at around 3 a.m. local time. Over eight hours later, Coincheck noticed an abnormal decrease in the balance.

Coincheck said the NEM coins were stored in a “hot wallet” instead of a “cold wallet”. Company President Koichiro Wada cited technical difficulties and a shortage of staff.

WHAT IS A HOT WALLET

Hot wallets are connected to the internet, therefore vulnerable to hacking. Experts warn that holding large sums in hot wallets is the equivalent of carrying large amounts of cash in person.

Cold wallets, such as Trezor and Ledger Nano S, are devices which can be as small as a USB stick and can be stored offline. Some keep them in a safe.

HOW ARE CRYPTO EXCHANGES REGULATED IN JAPAN?

Japan’s government in April recognized bitcoin as a legally accepted means of payment, and required exchange operators to register with the financial regulator.

The move - which came in the wake of the 2014 collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, then the world’s largest bitcoin exchange - was designed to protect consumers and clamp down on illegal use of cryptocurrencies. It also formed part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s push to stimulate growth via the fintech sector.

The Financial Services Authority’s requirements for would-be exchanges include robust computer systems and segregation of cash and cryptocurrency accounts, checks on traders’ identities and risk management systems.

As of Jan. 17, the FSA had approved the registration of 16 Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges. A further 16 or so exchanges that were operating before the regulation was introduced - including Coincheck - have been allowed to continue operating on a provisional basis as their applications are assessed.

CAN STOLEN NEMs BE TRACED?

The NEM.io Foundation, a Singapore-based organization supporting NEM blockchain technology, says it has a full account of the whereabouts of Coincheck’s hacked NEM, tracing the currency on the blockchain shared ledger.

The hacker has not moved any of the funds, the foundation said in a statement posted to the Medium publishing site, adding it would create an automated tagging system within two days to follow the coins and identify any account which receives them.

It is unclear how the holders would be identified.

HOW CAN INVESTORS AVOID BEING HACKED

Bitcoin evangelists recommend steering clear of centralized exchanges, arguing that the whole point of decentralized currencies was to not hand over control to third parties, such as central banks, commercial banks and exchanges, which raises the risk of mismanagement, scams or hacking.

Experts say only money needed for upcoming transactions should be kept in hot wallets. Even then, trading one cryptocurrency for another can be done over decentralized exchanges, such as Shapeshift, Changelly or Waves Dex, directly from the holder’s wallet and not from a wallet controlled by an exchange in their name.

Risks of fraud or hacking then only occur when a holder wants to exchange crypto assets for fiat currencies, but these can be minimized. Transactions can be done peer-to-peer in a safe, public place amongst members of the local crypto community rated by reputation on websites such as localbitcoins.com or via a centralized exchange, with the risk of hacking limited to the amount of time spent online to perform the transaction.",2018-01-29 07:12:34+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/report-claims-48-8-btcs-price-rises-last-9-months-occurred-within-2-hours-91-usdt-issuances/,"Report Finds Correlation Between USDT Issuances and BTC Price Moves

The Tether Report, a pseudonymously authored analysis examining the speculative assertion that bitcoin price volatility is highly correlated to the issuance of new USDT, has claimed that approximately 48.8% of bullish price movements have occurred within the two-hours immediately following ninety-one individual Tether grants.

Also Read: Vouching Bitfinex and Tether’s Bank Accounts Hold Nearly $3 Billion USD

Pseudonymous Author Scrutinizes Tether’s Operations

The Tether Report is authored under a pseudonym comprising a long string of alphanumeric symbols – with the author attributing such to their desire not to be identified out of concerns relating to the possibility of a “backlash” in response to their findings. Tether is described as a “stablecoin” – a cryptocurrency of which the tokens seek “to maintain a stable value of one USD per Tether or ‘USDT’.”

The report states that “Tether in its current incarnation is a 2014 rebranding of Realcoin [that] ostensibly function[s] by taking USD deposits from customers and exchanging them for an equal amount of USDT.” The author describes “the ability to price digital assets in USD without having USD-denominated bank accounts” as a major function enticing exchanges to adopt the cryptocurrency, stating that “the extreme difficulty many exchanges have faced in maintaining banking relationships” makes USDT “quite attractive.”

Tether Subject to Speculation Regarding Suspicious Activities During 2017

The report states that “A number of worrying events […] brought attention to Tether throughout 2017.” During April, Tether and Bitfinex “revealed that their banking relationships in Taiwan had been severed,” – which “led to a general suspension of deposits and withdrawals for retail customers.” Then, in April, the number of Tether issued began to undergo “a massive expansion,” despite the company’s “self-proclaimed inability to accept deposits from non-Taiwanese bank accounts.”

In early September 2017, Tether sought to reject suspicions that the company may be undercapitalized, “promis[ing] a historical audit that is still incomplete” to this day. Instead, the company “produced an internal document” later that month, which “purport[ed] to show USD balances back the then modest amount of [approximately] 440 [million] USDT. The internal memorandum did not divulge the “service agreements and institutional names attached to these funds,” comprising a “reduction of transparency since their April report,” which “establish[ed] the names of their earlier banking partners.

In November, Tether revealed that it had suffered a hack which was quickly “mitigated via an amendment to the Tether network code.” The next month, the company then announced that “the existing platform would be phased out and no further deposits [to] the current wallets should be attempted.”

Despite the many hurdles recently faced by Tether, the number of USDT in issuance has “increased ten-fold in only 5 months” following the release of September’s memo.

Report Finds USDT Issuances and Bitcoin Price Volatility to be Highly Correlated

The dramatic explosion in the number of USDT has led to speculation that Tether has been used as a means by Bitfinex to in order to maintain liquidity on the exchange following the loss of its banking partners – with some analysts going as far as to accuse Tether of mass-producing USDT as a means to manipulate the price of bitcoin.

The report seeks to test this assertion using empirical data, providing analysis of the relative price volatility experienced by bitcoin leading up to and immediately following the issuance of new Tether. The article concludes that “48.7% of bitcoin’s price growth between 3/29/17 and 1/4/18” took place during the “two-hour blocks” immediately following the ninety-one individual grants of new USDT – the collective time of which “total[s] less than 3% of the trading hours during that time period.” Transversely, the report concludes that “the average price behavior on a 2-hour timescale the compounded growth is just 6.5%,” leading the researchers in estimating that “a rough estimate of [approximately] 40% price growth attributed to Tether is defensible.

Damning Conclusions

The report makes a number of damning assertions, including the assertion that “extremely significant deviations from the shape of natural transaction data” across leading cryptocurrency exchanges may suggest that “coordinated market manipulation could be occurring” across the bitcoin markets.

Of Tether, the data is said to indicate that USDT “may be created when bitcoin is falling,” concluding that “Tether could account for nearly half of bitcoin’s price rise, not even allowing for follow-on effects and the psychological effects of rallying the market repeatedly.” The research emphasizes that “The statistics presented herein do to not establish wrongdoing but merely give rise to the opinion that the observed behavior appears questionable and should be further examined.”

Ultimately, the report advocates that Tether should “Conduct an audit by a reputable auditor,” adding that given the scale of the company’s operations that a “Big Four” accounting firm should be employed. The report suggesting that “The audit [should] not solely include a snapshot of accounts on a single date. It should also confirm that each Tether is backed by a dollar now and was for all points in Tether’s history. More than confirming that accounts of the proper amount do and have existed, the nature of those accounts and the service agreement between the banks and Tether should be divulged to show that these accounts exist solely for the benefit of Tether holders.”

Verge Currency is a decentralized currency based on an open-source platform, with no central control over the coin, founded in 2014 under the name DogeCoinDark. In 2016, it was rebranded to Verge Currency.

Verge is a 100% open-source software, with development and marketing efforts supported by thousands of its community members and is not a private company funded through an ICO or pre-mining.

Verge is a cryptocurrency that has been designed for everyday use. Verge originated directly from Bitcoin, with the Verge team making a number of improvements to the original blockchain technology so that it can achieve its goal of providing individuals and businesses with a fast, efficient and decentralized way of making direct transactions while ensuring personal privacy.

Compared with Bitcoin’s 10-minute block-times, Verge has up to a 30-second block-time capable of supporting up to 100 transactions per second, significantly greater than the 7 transactions per second with Bitcoin.

Additionally, while Bitcoin miners can only use the advanced ASICS hardware, Verge miners are able to mine on CPUs, while also being able to mine on some GPUs and ASICs hardware, with Verge’s proof-of-work algorithms bringing mining to the entire mining community.

The Verge Mission is to empower people around the world by bringing blockchain transactions into everyday life.

With Verge currency, businesses and individuals have flexible options for sending and receiving payments at the flick of a switch, with tools on offer that are capable of handling both large and small transactions between merchants and private payments.

Verge Features

Verge’s blockchain protocol uses proof-of-work algorithms, with verification carried out by decentralized nodes in Verge’s multiple anonymity-centric networks such as TOR and I2P. Within Verge’s network, each node connects to the network over TOR (The Onion Router).

Tor is a global network of servers that allows users to browse the internet anonymously. When browsing the internet over TOR, each search is bounced across a number of servers, which obfuscate the IP address of the user, ensuring that transactions with Verge’s blockchain tech are completely untraceable.

With significantly faster transaction times and capable of handling a vastly higher number of transactions per second, not to mention the increased privacy, the Verge platform is ready for mass adoption.

Verge’s Tor Android Wallet offers mobile anonymity that is a unique feature among the privacy-orientated.

The maximum supply of Verge Currency is capped at 16.5bn XVG. The total supply is on the higher side to facilitate convenient payment amounts for everyday use, while also making it harder to control a large portion of the total supply.

Because there was no ICO or pre-mine, the Verge team do not hold a significant amount of XVG coins that can affect coin distribution or total circulation.

While the privacy offering is already significant, the Verge team is currently working on its Wraith Protocol that is expected to materially enhance the privacy attributes, by allowing for the user to opt for transactions to be either public or private. Enabling the Wraith Protocol in a Verge Wallet would generate an address that cannot be traced back to the user’s Verge address.

The Verge team has also been working on introducing Smart Contracts with RSK technology that is also expected to lead to transaction capacity to surge to 2,000 transactions per second.

Features that are particular to Verge can, therefore, be summarised as:

Proof-of-work algorithm working best with CPUs and some GPU and ASICs hardware, leveling the playing field for miners.

Particularly fast transaction times of between 5 and 10 seconds depending upon the load of the network.

A Sizeable transaction capacity, which is projected to hit 2,000 transactions per second on the rollout of RSK.

Enhanced privacy offering, with the next milestone being the release of Wraith Protocol that gives the user the option to transact publicly or privately.

Verge Best Digital Wallets

Digital wallets are virtual wallets that allow coin holders to hold their cryptocurrencies away from the exchange from which they were purchased, with coin holders also able to send and receive cryptocurrencies from the wallet to exchanges or merchants.

It is possible for a coin holder to store coins on an exchange, but it is not advisable, with coins at risk of cyber-theft from hackers.

In the case of Verge, there are two types of wallets that XVG coin holders can use: QT and/or Electrum, as indicated by the team. The team also recommends that an Electrum wallet is used for everyday users.

Electrum is described as an open-source Bitcoin lite wallet solution. A Verge Electrum wallet, which was hard forked from the Electrum wallet, focuses on speed and low resource usage. Simple Payment Verification (SPV) technology is used that verifies transactions on the Verge blockchain without needing to download the entire blockchain.

As highlighted earlier, other digital wallets recommended by the Verge team require the entire blockchain to be downloaded.

The SPV technology speeds up transaction times from 30 seconds to around 5 seconds.

The alternative QT wallet requires the entire Verge blockchain to be downloaded and the device on which the wallet is stored will need to have enough storage capacity to not only handle the 1GB blockchain, but its growth as more transactions are made.

An added incentive to go with the Verge Electrum Wallet is that no back up is needed, only retaining the 9-word ‘seedphrase’ in a secure place is sufficient and preferably in hard copy so that it cannot be stolen by hackers.

Suggested Articles

Verge Exchanges

There are a number of exchanges that support Verge XVG, with the largest by volume of trade being Binance with Bittrex coming in second. Combined, the two accounted for more than 80% of total XVG transactions over the last 24-hours.

By currency, the largest trading was with Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum and then USDT.

Other exchanges include HitBTC; CoinSwitch and Cryptopia.

Why can Verge be a top Leading Cryptocurrency?

For cryptocurrency investors, anonymity remains a major concern, as the markets remain sensitive to regulations and bans news.

Regulators and governments have already established ways to link Bitcoin users to their wallet addresses, which allows governments and regulators to track individual transactions.

Verge has taken Bitcoin’s blockchain technology and made improvements to its privacy characteristics, by incorporating Tor and i2P networks that maintain the anonymity of Verge users, easing the concerns that Bitcoin holders continue to face.

With significantly faster transaction times and transaction times that are impressive, to say the least, the future looks bright for Verge.

One uncertainty will be the issue of anonymity and whether governments will permit the continued use of anonymous buying of cryptocurrencies from exchanges and what this could mean for Verge and its privacy protocols.

Cryptocurrency miners in Singapore can now buy their rigs pre-assembled right at the mall as more retail computer hardware shops enter this booming market. This is another strong sign of how retailers are diversifying away from their traditional costumers such as PC gamers, all due to the allure of cryptocurrency earnings.

Singapore Mining Mall

At least five computer stores are now selling cryptocurrency mining rigs in Singapore’s Sim Lim Square, according to a report from the region. The six-story complex is mainly known for attracting tourists from around Asia with its cheap electronics, shopping bargains, and many computer spare parts and service shops. However, Singaporeans these days want more cryptocurrency hardware than another knockoff mobile phone or gaming laptop, and local businesses are adopting to meet this demand.

One shop owner, Wilson Josup sells about ten rigs on a weekly basis, up from just one or two when he first started selling them about six months ago. He said that based on customer testimonials, letting a S$4,000 rig operate non-stop can earn around S$400 a month. And clients range from those in their 20s to retirees, he told the South China Morning Post. “Most of my customers would ask me to help transfer the rigs from their homes to a data center because they don’t like the heat and noise,” noted Josup, adding that his profit margin on each rig was around 10%.

Another store owner, Trecia Tay, has yet not sold any mining rigs but explains she now receives about ten inquiries about them every week, five times the amount of questions from just three months ago.

Background

Singapore serves as a global regulatory, financial and logistics hub for many companies in Asia. When the government of China started to threaten a clampdown on bitcoin-related activities under its jurisdiction, a number of Chinese businesses officially migrated to the island nation including bitcoin exchanges and miners. The country stands to benefit much more from this trend if it will continue to provide an accommodating and stable regulatory environment.

Beyond just Singapore, this story exemplifies how cryptocurrency miners are overcrowding the retail computer market all over the world. In a related matter, GPU manufacturer Nvidia recently requested retailers take measures to try and ensure its products get into the hands of gamers, not miners.

Imagine getting treated by a doctor with a fake diploma, or losing a job to another candidate who faked his resume. Unfortunately, such cases are all too prevalent these days in various parts of the world where proper documentation verification is too cumbersome or too costly. However, bitcoin might provide the answer to making sure this reality is preventable in the future.

Bitcoin CV Verification

University College London (UCL) has announced that its Centre for Blockchain Technologies has concluded a pilot program enabling MSc graduates in Financial Risk Management to offer instant verification of their academic qualifications using bitcoin.

All graduates of this course in 2016 and 2017 could register their degree details on a platform developed by London-based startup Gradbase. The school checked the validity of this data and then the system issued a transaction validating the authenticity of these degrees via bitcoin. The participating graduates received a QR code they can place on their CV documents, business cards or professional profiles which anyone can scan to verify their credentials.

The company’s co-founder, Cédric Colle, commented: “Academic fraud is a global issue which needs a global solution. The ambition of Gradbase is to become the first platform for easily and trustworthily verifying any qualification around the world.”

University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies

Founded in 1826 in the heart of Britain’s capital city, UCL is the third largest university in the UK by total enrolment and the largest by postgraduate enrolment. It has about 38,000 students from 150 different countries as well as more than 11,000 staff.

Its Centre for Blockchain Technologies (CBT) serves as an academic interdisciplinary research hub for bitcoin and related innovations, as well as a think tank connecting developers and regulators. It provides consultancy services to industry members, knowledge-transfer activities and in-house solutions.

“We are very excited to have collaborated with Gradbase on a pilot which is a UK first. The UCL CBT is playing a leading role in enabling the use of Blockchain technology in the education sector, and we believe that, in the future, such technology will become mainstream,” said Paolo Tasca, Executive Director of UCL CBT.

Tech blog Recode recently reported that the online cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase generated more than $1 billion of revenue in 2017, driven by a fourth-quarter surge in bitcoin's price that brought an onslaught of new users, elevated trading volume, and transaction fees.

If $1 billion in revenue doesn't sound like much, consider that Coinbase's revenue is derived only from fees. In other words, if you pay a $15 fee to buy $1,000 of bitcoin via Coinbase, only the $15 fee would flow into Coinbase's revenue line, not the full transaction value of $1,015. That's what makes this $1 billion revenue figure so remarkable: It's just from fees, nothing more.

Coinbase vs. traditional stock brokerages

When you compare what Coinbase made by processing cryptocurrency trades to what online discount brokers earn processing stock trades, it becomes evident that bitcoin exchanges have the better business model, at least for now.

Consider that TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) hauled in $440 million in commissions and transaction fees in the most recent quarter, putting transaction-related fees on an annual run rate of about $1.76 billion. That was an especially good quarter for TD Ameritrade, considering it includes the full contribution of its recent Scottrade acquisition. Even still, the online stock broker is on track to generate less than twice as much in transaction revenue on trades in real financial markets than Coinbase generated just from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

Likewise, Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) reported only $647 million in revenue from commissions on stock, options, futures, and currency trades in markets all over the world in the most recent year. In 2017, Coinbase generated more trading-related revenue just from cryptocurrencies than Interactive Brokers earned from trades on virtually every financial market around the world.

Estimating Coinbase's revenue per user

Coinbase's growth accelerated in the back half of 2017, so many of its users were only trading for a portion of the year. My back-of-the-envelope math suggests that Coinbase had about 8.5 million to 9 million weighted-average users over the course of the year, implying average annual revenue per user of roughly $111 to $118, based on my analysis of data collected and shared by Alistar Milne.

Of course, user numbers are likely to be inflated by inactive accounts. Given that opening an account at Coinbase is a multi-step process in which customers must open an account, add a funding source, and get verified before placing their first order, I suspect many of its users don't make it all the way to actually buying cryptocurrency with their accounts. Revenue per verified and funded user at Coinbase could be several times higher than my calculations, perhaps $300 per user, if not more.

Based on my analysis of TD Ameritrade's fourth-quarter earnings report, I calculate that the online discount broker earned about $119.30 per average funded account in transaction-related fees on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter. Coinbase almost certainly makes more in transaction-related fees on crypto trades than TD Ameritrade makes from trades on legitimate financial markets on a per-user basis.

Selling the dream a percentage point at a time

We probably shouldn't be surprised by Coinbase's billion-dollar revenue line. Whereas online discount brokers primarily charge flat-rate commissions on stock trades, crypto exchanges charge fees based on a percentage of the transaction value.

Coinbase's fees range from as low as 0.1% on its GDAX platform to as high as 3.99% when users buy bitcoin with a credit card on its retail platform, Coinbase.com. Thus, if you were to use a Coinbase.com account to buy a whole bitcoin at a recent price of $10,000, you'd pay anywhere from $150 to $399 in fees to do it.

In contrast, an online discount broker might charge as little as $10 on a trade in which a client buys or sells $10,000 of stock. (Interactive Brokers discloses that its customers paid an average of just 0.011% of the trade value in commissions and fees to place a trade via its service, 89% less than the least-expensive bitcoin trades on Coinbase's GDAX platform.)

High, variable fees are what make Coinbase's business model work. Whereas a small-dollar retail account might be unprofitable for an online stock brokerage, Coinbase can extract much higher fees on every dollar of transaction volume, resulting in more revenue per user.

All this is to say that selling the dream is a well-worn path to riches -- and Coinbase's success proves it.",2018-01-28,https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/bitcoin/how-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin-if-you-feel-you-need-to/,"If you plan to make short-term or small-volume trades, you may be happy with storing your coins in your account on the exchange. However, if you plan on sitting on your investment for six months or more, it is a good idea to transfer your coins to an outside digital wallet like Blockchain.info or Bitcoin Core for storage. Coins held in an exchange are effectively stored in one big wallet, and unlike a normal bank or stock exchange, there is no insurance or regulation to ensure you don’t lose your money if the exchange gets hacked or runs out of money. With a private wallet, no one can access your funds unless they have your private cryptographic key.

The downside to storing your coins outside the exchange, however, is that each time you transfer bitcoins back and forth between the exchange and your wallet you will need to pay a processing fee, which varies depending on network demand. If you request a transfer with a fee that is less than the current market rate, your transaction may end up stuck in limbo. If you do choose to use a private wallet, it’s a good idea to get familiar with the Bitcoin fee market, and learn how to calculate transaction fees.

Online brokerage: If buying on an exchange sounds too invloved, and you’re not planning on making a large investment, you can buy bitcoin directly from a broker. MyBTC.ca is a Canadian company that will let you buy up to $1,500 worth of Bitcoin using Interac online or prepaid credit card.

Buying from a broker requires a private wallet, so you will need to create one using a service like Blockchain.info. You will also need to verify your identity with MyBTC, but luckily you can do that using Equifax’s online identity verification and a Canadian phone number.

To make a transaction, you simply need to enter the amount you want to buy, and then enter your wallet’s receiving address and your debit or credit card information. As an additional verification step, MyBTC reviews every new user’s first transaction manually, which means your first purchase may take up to 24 hours to process. Once that transaction clears, your future purchases should be immediate.

Brokers charge a significantly higher fee per transaction than exchanges (MyBTC’s flat fee is 6.75%) but their fees cover all processing costs, including deposit and trading fees, and the variable processing fees for the blockchain transaction required to move Bitcoins from the broker’s wallet to your own. If you prefer to pay fees up front rather than being nickel-and-dimed, this may be for you.

Bitcoin ATMs: Rather than buy online, you can also find a physical Bitcoin ATM in your area. An ATM works the same way as an online broker, except you can use your debit or credit card as you would at a real ATM, and the daily buy maximum tends to be higher. You may also be able to verify your identity documents on-site, by scanning in your passport, for example.",2018-01-28 18:31:43+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/why-venezuelas-new-national-cryptocurrency-el-petro-will-fail/,"Why Venezuela’s New National Cryptocurrency El Petro Will Fail

Washington and legacy media are in a tizzy about Venezuela reportedly thwarting international sanctions by way of a dreaded state-backed cryptocurrency. A closer look reveals several stumbling blocks for the Bolivarian Republic: nonexistent reserves, hyperinflation, centralization, and the impossibility of actual redemption. The attempt will fail, if it’s ever rolled out, adding woes to a region plagued by years of monetary failure.

Also read: Tezos Swiss Foundation Concept is “Old, Inflexible and Stupid”

Venezuela’s Desperation Leads to Crypto

Rice University’s Francisco Monaldi put it succinctly to Foreign Policy, “The idea that it is a currency backed by reserves is pure fiction. So you are left with a currency issued by a country in hyperinflation and in default,” dismissing out of hand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela’s attempt at a state-backed cryptocurrency, the Petromoneda (Petro).

Geographically, Venezuela is the envy of most countries. Sitting atop South America’s bulbous north, it opens to a natural seaport and is bordered by the continent’s largest, most successful economy, Brazil. Natural resources abound. None of that seems to matter at the moment, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects 2018 the year Venezuela reaches 13,000% inflation. Half of its economy has vanished as it approaches a third annual double digit contraction. UNICEF warns of a growing child malnutrition crisis, suggesting this might be a generational problem for some time. There are tales of daily horrors, and they’re mounting.

A softer step away from war, international sanctions have played their part in Venezuela’s demise. From the United States’ long belligerent stance since the W. Bush administration to recent chirpings from the European Union and newly elected French president Macron, blockades and access to capital surely took a heavy toll.

In an effort to get around sanctions, the present administration has put forward a bold new plan: create a state-backed cryptocurrency, Petro. It is seemingly a last-ditch effort by a dying executive to reclaim fiscal sovereignty. Offered during the height of bitcoin’s rise last year, its mere mention has caused worry in Washington. Though the country has opted not to adopt bitcoin in particular, it has piggybacked off its press, and notoriously lazy US lawmakers are not exactly keen on tech literacy. All they know are headlines touting bitcoin’s spectacular price run, and that’s cause enough to fear Petro as a sanctions killer.

Redemption Problems, Reputation Problems

Nicolás Maduro Moros has presided over the country’s decline since his ascendancy in 2013, and Petro is his baby. Mr. Maduro’s retort to skeptics has been to double down, and back the nascent state crypto with barrels of oil and minerals. He’s even gone to coaxing neighbors with discounts. A white paper has yet TO appear, and his own legislative bodY deemed Petro illegal and a possible violation of existing sanctions. There are plenty more hurdles.

Fundamentally, Venezuela hasn’t been able to keep its state fiat paper, bolívar fuerte, afloat (itself only a decade old), and much of its resources, including precious oil, remain frustratingly earth locked or just plain undiscovered — a result due at least in part to lacking foreign know-how. What’s more, the country’s state run oil program is itself a hair-pulling-out exercise, placing commodity redemption more toward the spectrum of impossible: traders and dealers in the Petro would have to believe, have faith, their crypto could be redeemed. In the best of times, Venezuela has had massive trouble in this area. Today, it’s a bonafide mess. For good measure, its bolívar fuerte is already “backed” by the country’s commodity-rich promises, which should give massive insight into the crypto’s prospects going forward.

Models based upon bitcoin cause most regimes immediate pause. It’s just too volatile, and the last couple months of price swings have come with more people aware of the decentralized digital asset than ever before. This would discourage a great many from adopting Petro as a store of value or medium of exchange. What might still attract rogue regimes to a bitcoin-clone notion is its reported anonymity. But that too, with any kind of research, proves to be completely untrue. Reports surface daily about the ease of private companies to track down wallets and transactions, not to mention a newer study claiming to sleuth purchases made long ago subject to deanonymization.

Lastly, the ultimate irony of the Petro is it’s not a cryptocurrency in any meaningful sense. Gone would be its defining feature, decentralization — the distributed ledger designed to replace trusted third parties. A country of 30 million people beaten down by government monetary policy might not be too eager to hand over literally all control to state computer algorithms. The problems of fiat tickets would be dwarfed by a nosy government with the ability to literally monitor every purchase, every account, every fiscal movement, and shut down access instantly. At least cash offers some privacy.

The exchange, Coincheck, has promised to partially refund the 260,000 cryptocurrency investors affected by the theft, although it didn't say when it would do so or where it's getting the money from.

The hacking at Coincheck, which bills itself on its website as ""the leading bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange in Asia,"" came to light over the weekend. If confirmed, it's expected to rank as the biggest such theft on record, eclipsing the estimated $400 million in bitcoin stolen from Mt Gox in 2014.

Coincheck said the hackers stole customer deposits of NEM, a less well known digital currency.

The exchange promised to use cash from its own funds to pay out ¥46.3 billion ($426 million) toward covering its users' losses. That's about 20% less than the total value of the virtual tokens that were stolen.

Related: What is bitcoin?

Coincheck said in a blog post that the hack ""has caused immense distress to our customers, other exchanges, and people throughout the cryptocurrency industry.""

""We would like to offer our deepest and humblest apologies to all of those involved,"" the exchange said. It has currently suspended trading in all virtual currencies apart from bitcoin.

The price of NEM plunged almost 20% after the theft came to light over the weekend, but it has since recovered those losses.

Coincheck didn't respond to repeated requests for comment on how exactly it will fund the customer refunds.

A Japanese government spokesman said Monday that Coincheck would be asked to improve its business practices following the hack. Financial authorities are supervising the company's response to the theft, he said.

The Coincheck hack is the latest in a series of attacks targeting digital currency exchanges. Cybercriminals have been taking advantage of security weaknesses at young, often unregulated businesses that are handling huge sums of other people's money.

""Large scale hacks are among the biggest risks faced today by the global crypto community,"" said Henri Arslanian, a financial technology expert at consulting firm PwC in Hong Kong.

Related: Davos: Bitcoin is not a currency

Mt Gox, also based in Japan, was the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange when hackers broke in and stole an estimated $400 million worth of bitcoin almost four years ago. Mt Gox went bankrupt shortly afterward and affected users still haven't been compensated.

The meteoric rise in the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over the past year or so appears to have intensified interest from thieves.

Last month, South Korean bitcoin exchange Youbit filed for bankruptcy after being targeted by cybercriminals twice in the space of a few months.

In a separate incident last month, hackers made off with more than $70 million worth of bitcoin from NiceHash, a digital currency trading platform based in Slovenia.

Many exchanges have grown very quickly as trading has taken off but haven't focused on improving cybersecurity, Arslanian said.

That situation has created difficult questions for national governments on how to regulate the industry.

Related: I bought $250 in bitcoin: Here's what I learned

Some countries have taken a tough approach. China has tried to effectively ban trading in bitcoin.

Japan has taken a lighter touch. Last year, the government officially recognized bitcoin as a form of currency and started licensing exchanges.

But because Coincheck was already in business before the new rules came into effect, it wasn't yet registered with authorities.

-- Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.",2018-01-29,https://mashable.com/2018/01/29/bitcoin-tether-stablecoin-alleged-scam/,"Bitcoin has been on a run. Despite its recent dip, the cryptocurrency has impressed skeptics and believers alike in its monumental rise in value since its creation nine years ago. But all that could be on the verge of change.

Because while the argument rages on as to whether Bitcoin is in fact a currency or a store of value, one question looms large over all: Just what, exactly, is driving its price growth? Well, a consensus answer is slowly forming among critics, and it doesn't look good for the world of cryptocurrency.

In fact, it looks so bad that those same critics are predicting Bitcoin could take as much as an 80 percent hit in value. That would mean BTC, which at the time of this writing is worth around $11,085, would drop down to near $2,200.

SEE ALSO: Even Coinbase thinks you should maybe chill for a goddamn minute on Bitcoin

To understand why Bitcoin could be due for an imminent reckoning, one must first look to so-called stablecoins. The idea behind them is simple enough: peg a cryptocurrency coin, or a token, to something like the U.S. dollar. This would allow for many of the benefits of digital currency without the wild price swings rendering it less than ideal for real-world transactions.

One purported stablecoin in particular has dominated the space: Tether.

""Tether Platform currencies are 100% backed by actual fiat currency assets in our reserve account,"" the company claims on its website. ""Tethers are redeemable and exchangeable pursuant to Tether Limited’s terms of service. The conversion rate is 1 tether USD₮ equals 1 USD.""

According to Tether, as of Jan. 29 the company has $2,278,090,823.52 and €14,487,093.99 in liabilities.

""If there is questionable activity, the author believes a 30-80% reduction in BTC price could be forecast.""

Founded in 2015, Tether is connected to the online exchange Bitfinex. While the founders of that exchange had long insisted Tether was a separate entity, The New York Times reported in November that the Paradise Papers suggested otherwise.

Those leaked documents showed that Bitfinex's Chief Strategy officer, Philip Potter, along with its Chief Executive Officer, JL van der Velde, had worked with the law firm Appleby to established Tether in the British Virgin Islands sometime in 2014.

What does any of this have to do with Bitcoin's price? A pseudonymous report released on Jan. 24 alleges that Tethers ""may not be minted independently of Bitcoin price and may be created when Bitcoin is falling,"" and that it's possible the company is ""printing in response to market conditions.""

The author of the self-titled Tether Report is not alone in his or her suspicions. Tony Arcieri, an independent cybersecurity expert who formerly worked at Square, released a detailed look at Tether on Jan. 19 which came to similar conclusions and took it a step further.

""I, and many others,"" wrote Arcieri, ""suspect Tether is being used to effectively counterfeit hundreds of millions of dollars of perceived value, which are being immediately reinvested into Bitcoin to keep it from collapsing.""

As in, Tether may be creating value out of thin air. And that value, legitimate or not, is being pushed into the cryptocurrency world — allegedly artificially driving up Bitcoin prices in the process.

Every crypto-currency is being priced against Bitcoin which is inflated by counterfeit money, or counterfeit money (USDT pairs), once Tether implodes, nobody knows what prices will be.



It's been infected by Tether cancer. The only safe place is out until Tether is resolved. — Bitfinex'ed 🔥 (@Bitfinexed) January 28, 2018

What's more, the aforementioned Tether Report alleges that ""48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet."" Meaning, again, that according to the pseudonymous author, Tether looks to be driving increases in the value of Bitcoin. ""If there is questionable activity, the author believes a 30-80% reduction in BTC price could be forecast.""

It's not just random critics and cybersecurity experts making this claim. Nouriel Roubini, an economist and professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, is right there with them.

""Indeed Tether/USDT used to manipulate Bitcoin prices,"" he tweeted on Jan. 25. ""Without this scam Bitcoin price would collapse by 80%. Regulators asleep at the wheel while $2 billion of fake $ created via this scam, half of it since December.""

That Tether may not in fact have the billions in cash reserves to back the billions of Tether tokens issued could be easily disproved by an auditing of the company's books suggests a simple solution: release an audit. And yet, while long promising such an audit was forthcoming, the latest hope for such an accounting was dashed Saturday when CoinDesk reported that Tether and its supposed auditor were parting ways.

Clarification: statement says Tether's relationship with Friedman ""has dissolved."" Statement is vague about who broke up with who. Story coming $USDT — CoinDesk (@coindesk) January 27, 2018

In conversation with Mashable on Friday, Rafael Cosman, CTO and cofounder of the San Francisco-based TrustToken, put the problem succinctly. ""Tether claims that they do regular audits, but there hasn't really been evidence of that.""

Tether did release a document in September which was supposed to prove it held cash reserves equal to its Tethers, but that didn't convince skeptics. In a conversation with The New York Times, Lewis Cohen — a lawyer who works with virtual currency in his role at the law firm Hogan Lovells — noted that due to its wording the Tether document failed to prove Tethers are backed by dollars.

The coming crash of Tether/USDT will cause the crash of Bitcoin as the former was used to manipulate the latter https://t.co/dTaqim5RSW — Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) January 28, 2018

Meanwhile, hundreds of millions more Tethers — known as USDT — continue to be issued. Specifically, over 850 million worth have been ""minted"" since the beginning of 2018.

This doesn't sit well with Tether's numerous critics, who have taken to Twitter and YouTube to call out what they view as ""a complete ripoff"" and ""a complete scam.""

To make things even murkier, the ability to withdraw your Tether to your bank account in the form of USD has not always been guaranteed. As recently as December, Bloomberg reported that Tether's Terms of Service read as follows: “There is no contractual right or other right or legal claim against us to redeem or exchange your tethers for money. We do not guarantee any right of redemption or exchange of tethers by us for money.”

Importantly, a search of the company's current TOS page shows that language has been removed. Now, the company states that ""Absent a reasonable legal justification not to redeem Tether Tokens, and provided that you are a fully verified customer of Tether, your Tether Tokens are freely redeemable.""

The Terms of Service go on to note, however, that ""residents of certain U.S. states are not permitted to be customers of Tether; are not permitted to cause Tethers to be issued or redeemed; and, are not permitted to hold Tether Tokens.""

A recent Reddit post highlighted the confusion surrounding this. Titled ""Has anybody here actually had USDT deposited to their bank accounts as tether.to claims is possible on their website,"" the thread seeks to find someone that has successfully withdrawn their tokens for cash to their bank account. The silence in response is deafening.

""Without this scam Bitcoin price would collapse by 80%.""

Mashable reached out to Tether for comment on these claims, and will update this story when and if we hear back.

In the meantime, what does all this mean for Tether, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general? Well, if the critics are correct, likely nothing good.

""If one were to assume the worst case scenario,"" the aforementioned pseudonymous author of the Tether Report writes, ""that Bitcoin’s price has been artificially pumped up by Tether issuance, one would expect the market price of Bitcoin to be closer to $2,000 based on the trendline before April 2017 and the marked growth in Tether issuance.""

In other words, if this alleged house of cards ever comes crashing down, it may bring down Bitcoin's price with it with such force that the January crash will look like a walk in the park. And when and if that time comes, Tether's critics will be there to remind you that you were warned.",2018-01-29,https://www.coindesk.com/uk-crypto-trader-forced-to-hand-over-bitcoin-at-gunpoint,"A British man who runs a cryptocurrency trading firm was yesterday forced at gunpoint to hand over an unknown quantity of bitcoin.

The incident, which reportedly took place in the village of Moulsford in South Oxfordshire, is said to be the first bitcoin heist in the country. It was reported to the local police on Monday morning, a Telegraph report states.

According to a police spokesperson:

“Thames Valley Police is investigating an aggravated burglary which occurred at a property in Moulsford on Monday. No one was seriously injured during the incident. … No arrests have been made at this stage.”

The report describes how four robbers forcefully entered the residence and tied up a woman, while demanding that the trader, named as Danny Aston, transfer bitcoin at gunpoint.

Aston’s cryptocurrency trading firm was established in June 2017, as Aston Digital Currencies Ltd.

This is not the first case of armed robbery involving bitcoin.

A similar incident was reported in Ottawa, Canada, on 23rd Jan. In that crime, three armed men gained control over employees of a bitcoin financial institution before fleeing empty-handed, as previously reported by CoinDesk.

One suspect has been charged by the local police following bitcoin heist and two more of the accused robbers are being sought. The charges include robbery with a firearm and forcible confinement.

Bitcoin's price skyrocketed last year from below $1,000 to above $19,000 as investors piled in, generating demand from institutional investors for futures contracts that launched December on the largest futures exchange, CME, and its competitor, Cboe. Coinbase, the leading U.S. marketplace for major digital currencies, saw its users more than double from fewer than 5 million in late 2016 to more than 13 million by the end of the following year.

Coinbase did not respond to a CNBC request for comment on Robinhood Crypto's launch. The stock-trading app had nothing to add on Monday's 1 million sign-ups, other than a tweet from co-founder Baiju Bhatt stating the figure.

""To me, this speaks to a generational interest in crypto,"" said Blockchain Capital co-founder Bart Stephens.

About one in three millennials preferred bitcoin to stocks in a survey last fall from venture capital firm Blockchain Capital and Harris Poll. And Robinhood said 78 percent of its users fall into that younger age category of 18 to 35-year-olds.

But ""what Robinhood's going to find quickly is they're going to jump right into the same growing pains that Coinbase has,"" Stephens said.

While the cryptocurrency exchange reportedly took in more than $1 billion in revenue last year, the company struggled to handle high demand and trading was sometimes unavailable. Coinbase said in a statement it would not comment on the accuracy of the figures.

Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev told CNBC last week he is confident the start-up can handle customer demand. Cryptocurrency trading will also initially be rolled out in just California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire.

""I think we're going to be seeing more and more of these on-ramps,"" Stephens said. ""I think this is the beginning of a huge wave embracing this asset class.""",2018-01-29,https://www.wired.com/story/a-debate-about-bitcoin-that-was-a-debate-about-nothing/,"James Altucher would like to remind us of the math behind cryptocurrency: Two hundred billion dollars in supply. Two hundred trillion dollars of potential demand, even more if you throw in contract law. There’s 10,000 man-years of science behind it. The investment opportunity is bigger than you think, and trust him, he knows. “More than trading, more than charts, more than, like, investing---I run a hedge fund, I’ve been a day trader, I run a bunch of hedge funds, I’ve seen every trade in the book, I’ve written the book! It’s called Trade Like a Hedge Fund. Don’t buy it, I wrote it in 2004 ... I worked with Jim Rogers a long time, he hates it---but, but, what you have to ask is, not these little trading things, but what is going on? Why does bitcoin even exist? Why do cryptocurrencies even exist?” he tells a crowd of around 60 people crammed into a comedy club on New York's Upper West Side1.

I’m in the crowd to watch Altucher, a self-help guru, author, and podcaster, participate in a debate. His pale face, framed by crooked, rimless glasses and topped by a fluffy mop of curls, is instantly recognizable from the banner ads that have stalked me around the web for the last couple of months. Altucher, according to the ads, is the “crypto-genius” who will unveil the next bitcoin. Never mind criticisms that he directs his followers to invest in risky small-cap stocks and cryptocurrencies, leading to a temporary bump in their prices followed by a sell-off. Never mind the complaints from some customers that the newsletters and research papers he hawks via publishing company Agora Financial offer obvious information that’s otherwise freely available online. (Altucher and Agora Financial CEO Doug Hill have disputed these complaints.) Tonight he’s introduced as “the bitcoin baron,” “Mr. Bitcoin,” and even “the bitcoin babe.”

The debate topic---Which is a better investment, gold or bitcoin?---is mostly a farce, since both present opportunities for people eager to make a quick buck. (Tonight, it’s just a room full of New Yorkers, but online the supply of suckers is infinite.) Anything in the world can be twisted into a get-rich-quick scheme with the right buzzwords, charisma, and $2,000 newsletter subscriptions. And no one knows this better than James Altucher.

The crypto-genius enters the stage wearing a shiny blue boxing robe over a baggy cardigan over a baggy button-up over a white T-shirt that says “i’m fine.” He just turned 50 and bought a stake in this very comedy club. He relishes in celebrating his failures and counterintuitive rejections of things like college and 401(k)s. Lately, he’s been all-in on digital currency, an area that’s blazing with hype, greed, breathless speculation, and fear of missing out but is poorly understood by most people. Digital currencies are worth something because people value them as worth something, and Altucher’s endorsement can boost the price of the tiny crypto tokens. In that way, his predictions become self-fulfilling---his saying a token is valuable could actually make it so. For a couple of days, at least.

Agora Financial has used Altucher’s messy hair (geniuses don’t primp!), crooked glasses (geniuses don’t care!), and distant stare (geniuses think complex thoughts!) to market his financial advice via ubiquitous banner ads.

""We do not recommend that. It’s only for investors who invest speculatively,"" he said in an interview.

Mainstream investors and institutions remain split on cryptocurrencies, with some see it as the future of global markets, and others remaining highly sceptical.



Investors in bitcoin face a ""realistic risk of total loss"" and everyone but the most speculative should steer clear of cryptocurrencies, a senior staff member at the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank has warned.

""We do not recommend that. It’s only for investors who invest speculatively,"" Markus Mueller, Global Head of the Chief Investment Office at Deutsche Asset Management said in an interview with Bloomberg.

""There is a realistic risk of total loss.""

Mueller went on to say that for bitcoin to considered a real, tradeable asset that Deutsche AM may include in its portfolio, huge strides are needed on ""regulation, security and transparency,"" in the crypto world.

""Important issues such as liability and documentation are unclear,"" he said. ""We are still at the very beginning.""

""When security and trust are created, crypto-currencies can be assessed like established asset classes. It is possible that the governance required will exist in five to ten years from now,"" Mueller added.

Mainstream investors and institutions remain split on cryptocurrencies. Most see at least some scope for the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin to have real world applications, but many institutions see bitcoin itself (as well as other cryptocurrencies) as worthless exercises in speculation, not worth the distributed ledger they're printed on.

Late in 2017, for example, Paul Donovan, the global chief economist at UBS's wealth management arm, tore into the argument that cryptocurrencies could eventually replace fiat currencies like the pound and the dollar.

""The problem that cryptocurrencies face is that they fail the two key metrics of what makes a currency a currency,"" Donovan said. ""A currency has to be a widely used medium of exchange. Cryptocurrencies are never going to achieve that. Period.""

Mueller's assertion that Deutsche AM will steer of the crypto space for the foreseeable future comes after analysts at boutique research house Bernstein said similar.

""Cryptocurrencies and underlying blockchains seem set to grow and become a disruptive force. Thus they will have significant implications for investors. But, for now at least, they do not have a direct role in asset allocation,"" a note from a Bernstein team led by Inigo Fraser-Jenkins circulated last week said.",2018-01-29,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/japans-largest-consumer-electronics-chain-now-accepts-bitcoin/,"Yamada Denki, Japan’s largest consumer electronics retailer, has announced a new partnership with Bitflyer, and the acceptance of payments in Bitcoin on a trial basis. The retail chain will first launch the digital payment services at two of its Yamada Denki Labi stores in Tokyo, but it is planning to roll out this service to all of its stores across the country.

The two stores started to accept Bitcoin on the 27th of January. The partnership with Bitflyer is significant as it is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Japan by volume.

In the official announcement, Yamada Denki said: “We will implement initiatives to improve bitcoin recognition and usage promotion. With the introduction of bitcoin payment service, we respond to the diverse needs of our customers both in Japan and overseas. We believe that we can provide improved service and convenience.”

Bitflyer added: “Through collaboration with Yamaka Denki, we are contributing to improving the convenience of more customers in Japan and overseas.”

For the initial trial run, Yamada Denki has chosen two stores in Tokyo (Yamada Denki Labi Shinjuku east exit pavilion and Concept Labi Tokyo) for their strategic importance, as they attract many foreign visitors. This diverse customer base makes these stores a perfect testbed for trying out the digital currency integration.

Initially, there is a limit of 300,000 yen ($2,760) on Bitcoin payments. Bitflyer has also announced that it will give away 500 yen to the first 500 consumers paying with the digital currency using the Bitflyer wallet.

Lately, Bitcoin has been struggling to become a coin that can be used for daily transactions because of its network limitations. High network fees and long delays in transaction approval have become a huge setback for the mass adaptation of Bitcoin. Earlier this month, the North American Bitcoin Conference had to withdraw the Bitcoin payment option for its ticket sale because of these issues – the fee was around $30 at the time. But since then, average fees have gone down significantly – according to bitinfocharts.com, the current average transaction fee is $8.5 (median approx. $5).

Yamada Denki is not the first Japanese electronics store to accept Bitcoin as payment. In April 2017, Bic Camera partnered with Bitflyer to accept Bitcoin, and after 3 months, the retail chain started to accept Bitcoin at all of its 40 stores nationwide.

The social network says the ban, which includes both Facebook and Instagram, is to crack down on scams.

Cryptocurrencies are ""frequently associated with misleading or deceptive practices,"" it said.



Cryptocurrencies are a Wild West of sorts — and Facebook has had enough.

The social network is banning all ads related to bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs, it announced on Tuesday, as it attempts to crack down on scams and fraud.

The new rule ""prohibits financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency.""

It's a far-reaching policy, and Facebook describes it as ""intentionally broad.""

(For the uninitiated, initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are a largely unregulated method for company fundraising that involves selling investors cryptographic assets, in a similar vein to an IPO.)

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are insanely hot right now — but the space is also riddled with scams, fraud, and other risks.

This week, the SEC shut down one allegedly fraudulent ICO that claimed to have raised $600 million, and it's not uncommon for exchanges to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of customer funds in apparent hacks.

A Facebook spokesperson told Business Insider that the new rule bans all ads related to cryptocurrencies — not just those directly trying to sell cryptocurrencies or cryptographic tokens. So ads for Bitcoin wallets are also banned, for example, as are ones for Ethereum-mining hardware.

In a blog post announcing the news, Facebook product management director Rob Leathern suggested Facebook may tweak the policy at some point in the future to let legitimate crypto-related businesses advertise again.

""We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception,"" he wrote. ""That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.""

""This policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices, and enforcement will begin to ramp up across our platforms including Facebook, Audience Network and Instagram. We will revisit this policy and how we enforce it as our signals improve.""",2018-01-30,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16951670/facebook-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ico-deceptive-marketing-ban,"Facebook is banning all advertisements for cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin and initial coin offerings, as part of an “intentionally broad” policy against deceptive marketers. Product management director Rob Leathern explained the decision in a blog post, saying Facebook will no longer accept ads that “promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.” He says the decision isn’t permanent, though, and that Facebook will revisit the rules when it’s gotten better at detecting and removing bad ads.

“We want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception.

Facebook’s guidelines include a few examples of ban-worthy ads, including the straightforward “Use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin!” It urges people to report any ads that slip through the cracks, although it doesn’t specify how much of a presence cryptocurrency had on the advertising network before this change.

Facebook allows ads for sensitive financial topics, with some restrictions. It requires “written permission” for any real-money gambling or gaming service, for instance, and bans “misleading or deceptive” student loan ads. It also requires advertisers of these services to only target users over 18 years of age.

The new South Korean cryptocurrency account system has entered into force nationwide today, ending the current practice that allowed for anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies. Traders must open real-name accounts at the same banks as their exchanges in order to deposit money to trade cryptocurrencies.

Real-Name System Enforced

South Korea begins converting existing virtual cryptocurrency accounts to real-name accounts today as mandated by the government.

The implementation of this new account system effectively ends “the use of anonymous bank accounts in transactions to prevent virtual coins from being used for money laundering and other illegal activities,” Yonhap reported.

Six major banks in the country are participating in this new system so far: Shinhan Bank, Nonghyup Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Kookmin Bank, Hana Bank, and Gwangju Bank. The news outlet elaborated:

Opening cryptocurrency accounts has been banned for weeks while the banks have installed the system, which ensures only real-name bank accounts and matching accounts at cryptocurrency exchanges for deposits and withdrawals.

“Foreigners and underage investors are banned from opening cryptocurrency accounts in South Korea,” the publication noted, adding that “The new system also requires cryptocurrency exchanges to share users’ transaction data with banks.” Traders with existing virtual accounts will be fined if they keep depositing money into their existing accounts.

Business As Usual for Banks

“The market forecasted that there will be a lot of requests for opening new accounts following the introduction of the real-name system,” Maekyung wrote. However, on the first day of introducing the real-name system, the news outlet noted that banks are seeing little changes from the previous year, adding that some customers may have opened accounts online.

An IBK official told the publication that “there is no big difference” in the number of customers opening accounts at the bank.

A Chosun reporter visited several banks and found no unusual traffic. At a Shinhan Bank branch, there was a “customer guide” with definitions of crypto-related terms. It also includes an anti-money laundering guideline.

Real Name Verification

Korea Business explains that “Real name verification is possible only if there is an account of the person’s name at the bank that the virtual currency trading company uses.”

To open a new bank account for trading cryptocurrencies, customers “must submit documents to the bank…such as payroll, utility bills, credit card payments,” the news outlet detailed.

Bithumb has been trading with Nonghyup Bank and Shinhan Bank, Upbit with Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK), Coinone with Nonghyup Bank, and Korbit with Shinhan Bank. “Looking at the number of virtual accounts that are subject to the real-name system conversion, IBK has 570,000, Nonghyup Bank 1 million, and Shinhan Bank 140,000,” Hankyung reported.

Smaller Exchanges Could Suffer

Small and medium-sized cryptocurrency exchanges are expected to suffer from the conversion into the real-name system, local media report, citing that banks are reluctant to issue new accounts for them and they can no longer use existing corporate accounts.

The Korean Blockchain Association revealed that 10 companies out of its 25 crypto exchange members use corporate accounts in place of virtual accounts. They include Coinnest, Gopax, Coinlink, and Eyalabs, Maekyung reported. The publication quoted the association explaining, “Exchanges that have not been granted virtual accounts have fallen into the blind spot of regulation.”

Watching the wild ride of Bitcoin and its fellow cryptocurrencies, it’s hard to avoid the sense of deja vu. Flashing red lights are everywhere, from enormous day-to-day market gyrations to troubled companies scrambling to recast themselves as crypto plays. Let’s face it, there’s no way this all ends in anything but tears.

Now before the crypto fanboys jump me and beat me to an insensate pulp, let me make clear that I’m not questioning the potential uses or importance of cryptocurrencies and the technology, called blockchain, that underpins them.

“Cryptocurrency opens the door for revolutionary technological possibilities,” concludes PricewaterhouseCoopers, the international accounting giant. “Collaborative technology, such as blockchain, promises the ability to improve the business processes that occur between companies, radically lowering the ‘cost of trust.’”

But you don’t have to side with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon—who last year called Bitcoin a “fraud” and “worse than tulip bulbs” before recently softening his opinion—to see that the current crypto craze is only minimally about streamlining business transactions or protecting intellectual property.

Rather, many of the get-rich-quick investors buying Bitcoin, Ripple and their brethren are simply looking for a big, easy score, with only a minimal or non-existent understanding of what they’re actually investing in, or even how currency markets work. Instead, they look at an investment that was worth $800 in January 2017 and $11,000 in January 2018 and all they see is an arrow pointing up, up, up.

Here are just a few signs of the apocalypse:

According to a poll of Bitcoin investors conducted by educational lender LendEDU, 18 percent reported using their credit cards to pay for their Bitcoin purchases; a fifth of those carried the balance over into the next month.

In just the latest in a series of cryptocurrency exchange debacles, the Japanese exchange Coincheck disclosed last week that hackers stole more than half a billion dollars’ worth of coins.

Shares in Kodak tripled this month after the company announced it would create its own cryptocurrency.

Bragging about your crypto prowess by buying a Lamborghini is now a thing.

For some of us old-timers, it’s all reminiscent of nothing so much as the early days of the Internet gold rush. Then as now, an important new technology caught the fancy of the investors, who indiscriminately piled into the market without a firm grasp of the larger forces at play, the underlying pitfalls or the fragility of the bubble.

Then too, some people got very, very rich by getting out while the getting was good. (Looking at you, Mark Cuban.) And perhaps some others were smart and prescient enough to identify and invest in the Internet high flyers of 1998 that would still be around and prospering 20 years later (Amazon and, to a much lesser extent, eBay), as opposed to, well, just about everybody else.

Put another way, there’s a world of difference between recognizing that a new technology is going to be important and figuring out how to successfully profit from it.

At least the Internet bubble played out in a more or less established marketplace of IPOs and exchanges that were supervised (if sometimes only minimally) by government regulators. By contrast, the cryptocurrency market is still nascent, to put it charitably. CBOE became the first U.S. exchange to offer Bitcoin contracts—just last month. Meanwhile, proposals for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds remain in legal limbo.

It truly is the Wild West, and the terms of engagement are still being written. What are the rules and risks of dealing with the taxman? Are the concepts of cryptocurrency and investor protection mutually exclusive? Who the hell knows?

Analysts disagree over whether cryptocurrencies could pose a systemic risk to the world financial system the way that, say, subprime lending helped sink the global economy a decade ago. A survey of top European economists last month found that nearly three-quarters don’t view cryptocurrencies as a threat to financial stability. But Deutsche Bank placed the danger of a Bitcoin crash on its list of significant 2018 market risks.

At the moment, cryptocurrencies have more in common with a Las Vegas casino than they do with anything normally associated with the word “investment.” Like Vegas, a lot of crypto speculators are being swept away by the excitement and spectacle of it all. The price of a coin is up $4,000 today! No, wait, now it’s down by $5,000! Now it’s back up! Whee!

And also like Vegas, it’s possible to hit it big on occasion. But if you play long enough, the house always wins in the end. And just as in Vegas, only a fool mistakes luck for skill.

Not only are bitcoin (BTC-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) down, or a few other major cryptocurrencies, but digital currencies are largely plunging across-the-board. In all, the cryptocurrency market has lost about $70 billion in value over the past 24 hours.

The stock market's correction over the past couple of days could certainly be playing a role in the decline. In addition, a few troubling news items seem to be worrying cryptocurrency investors, which may be causing selling pressure.

Today's cryptocurrency prices

Here's a look at the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours.

Cryptocurrency Name (Code) Price in U.S. Dollars Day's Change Bitcoin (BTC-USD) $9,936 (12.5%) Ethereum (ETH-USD) $1,042.60 (11.6%) Ripple (XRP-USD) $1.10 (15.4%) Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) $1,476.20 (11.6%) Cardano (ADA-USD) $0.50 (17.1%)

Cryptocurrency prices are down pretty much across the board. In fact, all of the top 20 cryptocurrencies are down on Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) dropped below the key $10,000 level, and other leading cryptocurrencies were also plunging. Of the top five, only Ethereum (ETH-USD) remains in the green over the past week.

Subpoenas are scaring investors

One reason for the widespread decline was a Bloomberg report that a pair of subpoenas were issued to cryptocurrency-related companies. Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and coin issuer Tether were reportedly sent subpoenas on Dec. 6.

If you're not familiar, Tether's digital currency is supposedly backed by the U.S. dollar, and the company claims that each of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve -- in other words, each of Tether's coins is supposedly worth $1. As of this writing, this means that the company should have roughly $2.3 billion (in U.S. dollars, not in digital currencies) in reserve, although no evidence has been provided and many doubt that the money is actually there.

Both Tether and Bitfinex have the same CEO and also share some other corporate officers.

SEC freezes a huge ICO

Initial coin offerings, or ICOs, have been the subject of several warnings to consumers by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

On Tuesday, the SEC announced that it would be freezing the assets of Dallas-based AriseBank, and would be halting its ICO. According to the complaint, the bank ""used social media, a celebrity endorsement, and other wide dissemination tactics to raise what it claims to be $600 million of its $1 billion goal in just two months."" It also said that because the ICO was never registered with the SEC, it constitutes an illegal offer to sell securities.

AriseBank, which refers to itself as a ""decentralized bank,"" is also accused of falsely claiming that it purchased an FDIC insured bank, through which it could offer customers insured deposit accounts.

Adding to investor uncertainty

The bottom line is that there are several things going on in the cryptocurrency market that seem to be adding to investor fears. This, combined with an absence of recent positive catalysts, is likely the force pushing the cryptocurrency markets lower Tuesday.",2018-01-30,https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/,"The cryptocurrency world, with its volatility, is all about FUD—fear, uncertainty, doubt. And nothing is generating more FUD right now than an unusual currency called tether.

Unlike bitcoin and its many siblings, tether is what is called a stablecoin, an entity designed to not fluctuate in value. With most cryptocurrencies prone to wild swings, tether offers people who dabble in the market the option of buying a currency that its backers say is pegged to the US dollar. Trading bitcoin for dollars at a bank can be cumbersome and costly; by comparison, acquiring tether is simple, cheap and fast.

But in recent weeks a chorus of skeptics has called into question nearly everything about tether. The root of the controversy is whether the company behind it, also called Tether, is telling the truth when it claims that every unit in circulation is matched by a US dollar it holds in reserve. If the company has a dollar for every tether, that means in theory any holder can sell tethers back to the company for an equal number of dollars at any time. This belief keeps the value of a tether pegged to a dollar.

Critics on Twitter, Reddit, in blog posts, and at a recent bitcoin conference have been demanding that the company prove its reserves through external audits. Not only has Tether failed to do so, last week it confirmed rumors that it had severed ties with Friedman LLP, the accounting firm on tap to perform those audits. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission had sent subpoenas to Tether. A Tether spokesperson said, ""We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations. It is our policy not to comment on any such requests."" The spokesperson declined other comment.

If tethers are not backed by a matching number of dollars, then Tether can print an arbitrary amount of money. (Other cryptocurrencies, by contrast, create new tokens according to strictly prescribed, predictable rules.) Other problems ensue, including suspicions that Tether is timing the release of new tethers to coincide with drops in the price of bitcoin and then using those tethers to scoop up bitcoins. Some observers fear that these purchases are artificially inflating the price of bitcoin. “It’s possible that a nontrivial rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has come from this asset being printed possibly out of thin air, and that is very concerning,” says Jill Carlson, a former Wall Street trader who now invests in and consults for cryptocurrency startups.

If traders lose faith in tether, they could end up triggering the crypto version of a bank run. Tether helps stabilize cryptocurrency exchanges in various ways, so its collapse could also cause some exchanges to topple, wiping out billions of dollars of investments overnight and potentially undoing much of the public’s growing interest in new technologies like bitcoin.

“It’s possible that a nontrivial rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has come from this asset being printed possibly out of thin air, and that is very concerning,” says Jill Carlson.

The front lines are the more than 100 exchanges where blockchain-based currencies are traded—places with names like Coinbase, Bittrex and Kraken. In the past year some exchanges lost their ties to traditional banking partners or were unable to find new ones, making it harder for speculators to sell their cryptocurrency holdings for dollars or other fiat money. Tether grew popular in this climate because it offered traders a way to escape the volatility. They could buy tethers with some confidence that the currency would not suddenly plummet in value.

Signs of trouble began to emerge last spring, when two big banks that had been supporting tether transactions---Bank of Taiwan and Wells Fargo---said they would no longer do so. The banks also said they would no longer deal with Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange whose top personnel---its CEO, CFO, chief strategy officer, chief compliance officer and general counsel---hold the same positions at Tether. Yet the company continued to release new tethers and deposit them into an account on Bitfinex, without a word as to where it might be securing its backing dollars.",,https://qz.com/1193770/japanese-chat-app-line-is-launching-a-cryptocurrency-exchange/,"Line, which has more than 200 million monthly active users worldwide, announced today (Jan. 31) that it is planning to start a cryptocurrency exchange.

The Tokyo-based chat app said in a statement that it has filed an application for registering a crypto exchange with Japan’s financial regulator, and that the application is currently under review. The company will also launch a variety of financial services, including a place to trade cryptocurrencies, within the chat app. These new initiatives will be operated by Line Financial, a subsidiary established earlier this month.

Line already offers a mobile payment service within its chat app, called Line Pay. With 40 million registered users, the digital wallet’s annual global transaction volume reached ¥450 billion (around $4 billion) last year, the company said. In comparison, Coinbase, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has about 13 million users.

The move underscores how Japan has become one of Asia’s most friendly jurisdictions for cryptocurrencies, particularly as China and South Korea have been cracking down on them. In September, Japan’s financial regulator granted a first batch of 11 companies licenses for operating crypto exchanges. Bitcoin-yen trading comes after bitcoin trading in the dollar and euro as the third-largest currency pair in bitcoin markets, accounting for more than 10% of global trades.

Line is probably best known for its characters like Brown the bear and Cony the rabbit, whose images adorn not just stickers in the chat app but also merchandise sold in Line stores around the world. But as user numbers flatten, the company is looking for alternative revenue streams. According to its statement, Line is also hiring people with expertise in blockchain technology and finance, as the company “hopes to become a leader in the FinTech industry as the world moves increasingly towards a cashless wallet-less society.”

Japan’s embrace of cryptotrading hit a snag last week after hackers stole $530 million of cryptocurrencies from Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck. Japanese authorities said they would investigate all local crypto exchanges for security gaps following the breach.",,https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16949550/bitcoin-graphics-cards-pc-prices-surge,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin have soared in value over the past year, thanks to continued interest from a range of investors. As the price of these cryptocurrencies has increased, graphics cards have also seen big price increases thanks to retail stock shortages. A range of mid- or high-end graphics cards from AMD or Nvidia are in short supply, mostly due to cryptocurrency miners buying them in bulk to build machines to mine bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.

Polygon reports that pricing for Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1070 should be around $380 (depending on the model), but that some cards are now being sold for more than $700 due to the stock shortages – an increase of more than 80 percent. Cryptocurrency miners use stacks of graphics cards to solve the mathematical problems need to authenticate payments on the network and create new bitcoin. There’s only a finite number of bitcoins available, and because of the way the network is designed, each new bitcoin takes more power to mine. This has led to increased demand for more powerful graphics cards to tackle multiple cryptocurrencies.

Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD have been affected by rising prices

The graphics card pricing is making it a lot harder to build a gaming PC from scratch right now, especially as the stock shortages of mid-range cards like the GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 also push up the prices of more capable cards. Nvidia’s GTX 1060, GTX 1070, GTX 1080, and AMD’s Radeon RX 570, 580, Vega 56, and Vega 64 cards have all been impacted in recent months.

Nvidia is advising its retail partners to prioritize gamers over miners, but retailers are able to generate some impressive margins at the moment so it’s unlikely that simple advice will result in real changes. Some retailers are limiting purchases so miners can’t buy stacks of cards, and Polygon reports that Micro Center is specifically offering discounts to PC gamers who are buying the cards alongside other components. Micro Center blames high demand from miners and constrained shipments from vendors for the industry-wide shortages.

It’s a problem that’s affecting pricing worldwide, not just in the US, and it seems unlikely to end unless graphics card vendors can flood the market to keep up with demand. It could put off PC gaming newcomers who are deciding between building a mid-range PC or opting for a PlayStation 4 Pro / Xbox One X. Gamers have had to put up with volatile pricing of RAM over the years, and as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency pricing continues to fluctuate it’s clear that graphics cards will be the latest bottleneck in building the perfect gaming PC.",2018-01-30

They’re completely overexposed in the media, but still somehow shrouded in mystery. To help you keep up with the cryptocurrencies, we’re answering some of the most-asked questions.

A cryptocurrency is exchanged in the digital world using cryptography, which is essentially a system of secret messages. In other words: There’s no physical coin or bill to put in your wallet—it’s all virtual. But cryptocurrencies do have a dollar value (and they can fluctuate wildly on a day-to-day basis).

The cryptography is how the creation and transactions of units is controlled and kept secure, and all the transactions are public. There’s no central banking system, like the Federal Reserve, managing it—nobody’s in charge, and everybody is in charge.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be fully implemented and has the most name recognition, but there are more than 1,000 different ones out there. Other popular types include Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano and Litecoin.

2. What is mining?

As with gold or diamonds, if you want to discover new units of cryptocurrency, you have to roll up your sleeves and dig — albeit through virtual terrain. (Mining also refers to the process of verifying cryptocurrency transactions and adding them to the public ledger.) And instead of pickaxes, pans and shovels, the tools required for cryptocurrency mining include the appropriate computer setup, software and high-level math.

Different currencies call for different approaches, which can change over time. For example, as bitcoin gained in popularity and value, mining it has required an increasing amount of computational and electrical power. While you once could’ve used a personal computer, now entire mining operations with networks of specialized hardware are on the job. Other currencies can still be mined on a smaller scale.

Everything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong

3. What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is the automatically and constantly updated public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. The blockchain can be shared with anyone in the network, but cannot be altered—making it the key to operating without a Fed-like centralized system at the helm. (The bitcoin blockchain is public and can be accessed by anyone. Check out blockchain.info.)

Related: The blockchain economy is coming, with or without bitcoin

Many people think that blockchain technology is the core of the cryptocurrency craze and perhaps the real thing worth investing in. Companies like Microsoft, MSFT, +1.00% IBM IBM, -0.29% and JPMorgan JPM, +1.57% are developing and integrating blockchain systems into their businesses.

4. How is the value determined?

The price of bitcoin, like stocks, is largely speculative. Unlike gold, it does not have intrinsic value, and unlike U.S. dollars, no government grants it legal tender status. So it’s really only worth anything because someone’s willing to pay that price for it (with the belief that someone else is willing to pay more). And many other cryptocurrencies are priced in part based on bitcoin’s value.

5. What are the risks of investing?

Just like when investing in individual stocks, you risk losing your money if your cryptocurrency of choice tanks. Unlike with individual stocks, you have no real way of evaluating the odds of your investment doing well, and we have little historical data to analyze broader trends — making it tough to determine a fair price to pay or when it’s time to sell.

Plus, with such minimal regulatory oversight (which is the appeal for some), cryptocurrency accounts are not protected by the FDIC. So this area is rife with swindlers looking to sell you a crypto-scam.

6. How much should you invest?

Only what you can afford to lose. The potential rewards of cryptocurrency investing are inarguably high. For example, bitcoin went from about $800 in January 2017 to $19,000 within a year, according to crypto-news site CoinDesk.

But the risks are just as steep. Consider bitcoin’s drop the week before Christmas, from around $19,000 on December 18 to under $14,000 on the 22nd. Though it recovered to more than $17,000 on January 6, it’d fallen again to about $13,000 by January 11. That kind of volatility should be limited to a small portion of your portfolio — the part you’d be OK never seeing again.

7. How do you invest in cryptocurrency?

You can directly purchase digital currencies via exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp. You can also try connecting directly with individual sellers through LocalBitcoins.com. (Check out Buy Bitcoin Worldwide to see other options.)

Or you can go the fund route with Bitwise HOLD 10 Private Index Fund if your income and net worth qualify you as an “accredited investor.” Soon, you may be able to invest in a cryptocurrency through an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Both Cboe Global Market and the New York Stock Exchange have filed to list cryptocurrency-related ETFs.

Another option: initial coin offerings, which are like initial public offerings for debuting cryptocurrencies—but with more risk.

8. How do you store bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies?

In your digital wallet. Many cryptocurrency exchanges offer a wallet you can connect to your regular bank account. You can also find other apps, like Bither, ArcBit and Green Address, that focus on bitcoin storage. (Coinbase will store the cryptocurrencies you purchase through the platform for you.)

For added security, you can consider a hardware wallet like the bitcoin options from Trezor, Digital Bitbox and KeepKey. These flashdrive-looking devices allow you to take your cryptocurrency offline and protect it from vulnerabilities inherent with the web.

9. Where can you spend cryptocurrencies?

The list of businesses that accept such payments is limited, but growing. It includes Overstock.com OSTK, -6.44% Subway, Microsoft and Bloomberg.com, among others. (See an extensive list on 99bitcoins.com).

You can also be creative and barter to put your cryptocurrency to practical use. For example, the first real-world bitcoin transaction, according to popular internet lore, was in 2010, when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz posted in a forum that he’d give 10,000 bitcoins (now worth well over $100 million) to anyone who brought him pizza. Someone took the offer and paid $25 for two Papa John’s pizzas to be delivered to Hanyecz.

10. Is all this for real?

No doubt, all this cryptocurrency stuff sounds like it’s straight out of a sci-fi story. But we are living in the future. Remember that once not too long ago, people were balking at the idea of email, e-commerce and social media. And companies that were slow to adopt advancing technologies went the way of the Dodo. (Hey, Blockbuster and Borders.)

The bottom line is: bitcoin and its ilk are increasingly popular investments, as well as forms of payment—and in some way, cryptocurrency is here to stay. Whether you literally buy into it or not is up to you and your risk tolerance.",2018-01-31,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-finds-nearly-600-million-in-crypto-crime/,"South Korea Finds Nearly $600 Million in Crypto Crime

Reports from the 대한민국 Republic of South Korea (ROK) indicate its Customs Service announced on Wednesday, 31 January 2018, it has discovered “cryptocurrency crimes” which amount to nearly 600 million USD.

South Korea Customs Service Finds Almost $600 Million in Cryptocurrency Crime

ROK Customs Service released a statement claiming to have “uncovered cryptocurrency crimes worth 637.5 billion won ($594.35 million),” according to Reuters. Evidently, it includes illegal foreign exchange trading, a statement released by the country’s customs service said on Wednesday.

Korean Customs Service’s (KCS) charter includes keeping “our society safer from illegal foreign transactions,” its website notes. Reporting on the incidents mention South Korean investors gobbling up almost 2 billion won in cryptocurrencies. Supposedly tokens and coins were then sent abroad through “virtual wallets,” only to be brought back in the form of fiat currencies “which amount to unrecorded capital outflows,” according to Reuters.

The statement continued, “Customs service have been closely looking at illegal foreign exchange trading using cryptocurrency as part of the government’s task force.” Reuters further explained, “Illegal foreign currency trading of 472.3 billion formed the bulk of the cryptocurrency crimes, Customs said, but gave no details on what action authorities were taking against the rule breaches.”

“Among other breaches,” the report continued, “Customs said there were also cases where investors in Japan sent their yen worth 53.7 billion won to their partners in South Korea for illegal currency trade.” This series of events comes at the end of a very hectic few months for the peninsular East Asian nation. Yesterday, US regulators in New York requested trading data on cryptocurrencies. New regulations regarding cryptocurrency exchanges took effect as well, essentially eliminating anonymous trades.

Wait and See

Even the Republic’s chief of state recently issued guidelines concerning public officials and their involvement in crypto. There has been a multi-pronged approach to limiting, if not outright ending, foreign participation in exchanges, which included South Korean card companies.

Ecosystem markets were rocked at the end of the year when fears arose cryptocurrencies would be banned outright. It turned out to be just a minister spouting off, but that unleashed a wave of dips in prices, and it spurred domestic protests to essentially leave cryptocurrencies alone.

As East Asia’s fourth largest economy, South Korea punches above its weight in the crypto world, clearly. “The customs office added that it would continue to monitor the use of cryptocurrencies in cases like illegal currency trading or money laundering,” Reuters explained. No word yet as to how the market will absorb this current controversy.

Concerns about stronger regulatory action pressured the cryptocurrency markets throughout most of January. Only one of the top five cryptocurrencies -- Ethereum (ETH-USD) -- finished the month with a gain.

What were the forces behind January's cryptocurrency price moves, and what financial measure should prospective cryptocurrency investors focus on?

What the five largest cryptocurrencies did in January

Here's a look at the five largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours, as well as during the month of January.

Cryptocurrency Name (Code) Price in U.S. Dollars Day's Change Monthly Change Bitcoin (BTC-USD) $10,056.00 (0.7%) (24.7%) Ethereum (ETH-USD) $1,109.10 4.3% 47.4% Ripple (XRP-USD) $1.11 (4.6%) (45.3%) Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) $1,475.50 (1.6%) (36%) Cardano (ADA-USD) $0.50 (6.1%) (29.6%)

Most major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC-USD), performed poorly in January. Ripple (XRP-USD), which had been driven higher by speculators in the wake of major partnership announcements with American Express, Santander, and MoneyGram International, was the month's biggest loser, down by more than 45%. The only winner in the top five was Ethereum (ETH-USD), which soared to an all-time high in January and regained its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.

January was full of regulatory fears

The primary driver of the decline in cryptocurrency prices was a fear of global regulatory scrutiny, particularly in key crypto market South Korea. In mid-January, fears that South Korea and China could crack down on cryptocurrency trading caused $300 billion in cryptocurrency market cap value to evaporate in one week. And while many cryptocurrencies have recovered a bit from the lows, a steady stream of regulatory news items have added to volatility and kept prices depressed.

Ethereum was the big winner of January

Unlike most of its peers, second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH-USD) had a great January. Most of the gains took place toward the beginning of the month after reports that Ethereum network transaction volume had doubled and that there had been instances of more than 10 transactions being processed per second.

One important takeaway

If you're not a cryptocurrency investor yet and are thinking about buying one of these (or any other) digital currencies, it's important to recognize how volatile they can be. Pay particular attention to the ""monthly change"" column in the table above: The least volatile of the top five digital currencies moved by about 25% for the month, and January was actually a relatively quiet month by cryptocurrency standards.

An investment in cryptocurrencies can easily fluctuate by 25%, 50%, or even more in a relatively short period of time, so while there's nothing wrong with speculating with your extra money, don't put any money into cryptocurrencies that you aren't willing and able to lose if things don't go your way.",2018-01-31,https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-turkish-club-harunustaspor-first-to-pay-for-a-footballer-using-cryptocurrency-2018-1,"A Turkish sports club claims it is the world's first football team to purchase a player using bitcoin.

Open up the Google Play Store, type in the word bitcoin and you're in business. Some of the top cryptocurrency-themed Android apps promise their users that they can get them in on the recent boom in prices.

Except, they won't. Despite being download thousands of times, many of the apps promising free bitcoin or bitcoin mining mining don't really do anything – let alone make you money. ""Most of these apps are fake miners,"" Lukas Stefanko, a malware researcher at security company ESET said towards the end of last year. ""Their main purpose is to display in-app ads each time a user starts to allegedly mine bitcoin."" He concludes that they are ""without any relevant functionality"".

While the apps aren't necessarily doing any harm other than leaving unsuspecting downloaders disappointed, they're part of a bigger surge in fraudulent attempts to make money from the buzz around bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

The clampdown begins

Now, a clampdown against these bad actors is underway. Yesterday, Facebook announced it is banning advertisements for cryptocurrencies and ICOs after seeing a rise in fraudulent advertisements being purchased. ""There are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith,"" Rob Leathern, Facebook's product management director wrote in a blog post. But Facebook's move shouldn't come as a surprise.

The ICO bubble rose to prominence during the middle of last year, and since then more and more firms have been trying to get in on the action, often with pretty outlandish claims. Samsung is said to be building hardware for cryptocurrency mining. An ICO was proposed for an AI blockchain. Kodak launched its own cryptocurrency. And even Arsenal football club jumped on the bandwagon.

""Over the past six months, it has become abundantly clear that the ICO market as a whole is out of control,"" says Kevin Werbach, an associate professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.

Dodgy ICOs

Some of these crypto offerings have turned out to be outright scams. On January 29, the Ethereum-based Prodeum vanished from the internet (leaving its website with just the word 'penis' written on a white background). The plan for Prodeum, before things went wrong, was to use the blockchain to track vegetables through supply chains. It wanted to raise around £4.5 million through its sale of tokens but ended up with around £8. Other ICOs have been more successful before also disappearing. At the end of November another Ethereum startup vanished after making £264,000.

Following Prodeum's disappearing act, regulators in the US have taken action against another ICO. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that it believes an ICO from AriseBank is a ""scam"". The company, which is based in Dallas, US, says the sales of its coin have raised around £423 million. During its promotional phase, the ICO was endorsed by boxer Evander Holyfield. After an initial investigation, the SEC froze the firm's assets and those of its two co-founders, Jared Rice and Stanley Ford. The SEC claimed the firm was attempting to raise funding while ""misrepresenting the company as a first-of-its-kind decentralised bank offering its own cryptocurrency"". The SEC has also revealed it is investigating Bitfinex and Tether, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges.

Spreading regulation

Regulators around the world are also getting wiser to cryptocurrency schemes. German regulators have previously frozen the assets of a firm called Onecoin Ltd, which was responsible for the coin of its own name. The leaders of Deutsche Bank have also tried to perturb potential crypto investors by warning of a ""total loss"". And in the UK, the Financial Conduct Agency has warned that investors are being targeted by cryptocurrency and bitcoin scams online.

South Korea has gone the furthest in imposing controls on cryptocurrencies. It's one of the biggest markets for trading, but new regulations say that anonymous crypto trading may no longer occur; digital wallets storing cryptocurrencies must be in the same name as the bank account holders they belong to. As other countries look to regulate the emerging markets, South Korea's model could become a benchmark. Bitcoin's price dropped as the rules came into effect.

""A big reason that regulators are moving more aggressively now is that it’s increasingly clear the market took their prior inaction as a green light for anything an ICO team could convince a lawyer to endorse,"" Werbach says. ""Much of the ICO community misinterpreted regulators trying to get it right for a blanket endorsement.""

You're not the only one who dreams of cashing in on cryptocurrency mania. Samsung's right there with you.

In its fourth-quarter earnings report Wednesday, the consumer-electronics purveyor and world's largest chipmaker by revenue said it expects its foundry business to get a bump-up from ""growing demand for cryptocurrency mining chips.""

It also confirmed, separately, that it's making such chips.

""Samsung's foundry business is currently engaged in the manufacturing of cryptocurrency mining chips,"" the company said in a statement sent to various media outlets. ""However, we are unable to disclose further details regarding our customers.""

Mining for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin means putting your computer to work solving thorny math problems that're used to verify cryptocurrency transactions. In return for your gobs of processing power, you can be rewarded with coins.

And with some cryptocurrencies worth thousands of dollars per coin, and huge hype around the phenomenon, it's no surprise a rush of gold diggers are pumping up their computer systems with high-powered chips to get in on the act.

In fact, despite a dip in the value of Bitcoin, things have gotten so frenzied that computer gamers who want to make home-brew systems for playing Call of Duty (or whatever) are having a tough time getting hold of graphics cards. It seems the cards have turned out to be great for mining cryptocurrencies like Ethereum.

The Samsung chips in question are ASIC, or application-specific integrated circuit, chips, the BBC reports, pointing to the Korean-language newspaper The Bell. ASIC chips can be customized for a particular use.

In hopping onto the crypto bandwagon, Samsung joins companies like Kodak, which earlier this month announced a cryptocurrency-based service designed to help shutterbugs get paid when their photos are used without a license. And where there's money, there's monkey business: Facebook said Wednesday that it's temporarily banning cryptocurrency ads on the social network to protect people from scams.

Finance minster Arun Jaitley, in his budget speech today (Feb. 01), stated that the government will do everything to discontinue the use of bitcoin and other virtual currencies in India. He reiterated that India does not recognise them as legal tender and will instead encourage blockchain technology in payment systems.

“The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system,” Jaitley said.

This declaration comes after months of speculation over the fate of cryptocurrencies in India, home to a large number of bitcoin traders and investors. In fact, one in every 10 bitcoin transactions in the world takes place in India.

“The government will now either come out with a legislative mechanism or make suitable amendment in existing legislation to ensure that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency is made illegal and to penalise entities and individuals who are involved in their trade and circulation,” said Monish Panda, founder of Monish Panda & Associates law firm. “We will have to wait and watch as to what will be the final framework of such legislation.”

Over the last few months, the government and the Reserve Bank of India have repeatedly expressed their discomfort over bitcoin and other e-currencies. Late last year, the finance ministry dubbed them a ponzi scheme. “There is a real and heightened risk of investment bubble of the type seen in ponzi schemes which can result in sudden and prolonged crash exposing investors, especially retail consumers losing their hard-earned money,” the ministry had said. “Consumers need to be alert and extremely cautious to avoid getting trapped in such ponzi schemes.”

At the same time, the Narendra Modi government had also announced the setting up of committee to understand the implications of virtual currencies, and to ascertain the worldwide regulations surrounding them.

Jaitley’s stance today should now put to rest doubts over the government’s approach.

Other countries, too, have been jittery in this regard. For instance, in January China was reportedly preparing to widen its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading. Nonetheless, Indian cryptocurrency exchanges held out hope, arguing that the government would maintain some balance in its regulations.",,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/tether-explained-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-why-people-worried-2018-1-1014668561,"Sean Gallup/Getty Images

Bitcoin fell on Wednesday after an academic paper claimed the cryptocurrency's run to $20,000 appeared to be driven by market manipulation.

The alleged manipulation centres around exchange Bitfinex and the cryptocurrency Tether, which it is closely linked to.

The paper claims Bitfinex used Tether to buy bitcoin at times of low demand and prop up the price. Bitfinex denies this.

It's not the first time concerns about Tether have surfaced. Rumours have been circulating that Tether, a crypto pegged to the dollar, does not have the currency reserves to back it up. The company behind Tether strongly denies allegations.



LONDON — Cryptocurrency Tether is back in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.

Academics at the University of Texas published a paper on Wednesday alleging that Tether was last year used to manipulate the price of bitcoin, propping up its run to $20,000 last December.

Concerns have been swirling in the cryptocurrency market for months about Tether, a cryptocurrency issued by Tether Limited. The price of bitcoin dived in February after news that Bitfinex and Tether had been subpoenaed by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Tether is meant to be backed one-for-one by the US dollar. It plays a central role in the operation of many leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitfinex, but critics suggest it doesn't have the dollar reserves it claims. Bitfinex denies this. If this theory is true, it has the potential to crash the price of bitcoin and potentially hobble the operations of many exchanges.

Here's what you need to know:

What is Tether?

TetherTether is a cryptocurrency that's meant to be backed one-for-one by the US dollar. The idea is to have the price stability of the dollar combined with the operational ability of a cryptocurrency. It's what people in the crypto world call a ""stable coin.""

The cryptocurrency was created in 2015, originally called Realcoin, and there is $2 billion-worth of so-called USDT in circulation today, according to industry data source CoinMarketCap.com. It was hit by a $31 million hack last November.

Who is behind it?

Tether tokens are issued by Tether Limited, a company based in the British Virgin Islands according to the New York Times. Tether's website says it is incorporated in Hong Kong, with offices in the US.

The company has many of the same management team as Bitfinex, the Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange that is one of the biggest in the world. Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is CEO of both Bitfinex and Tether, and Philip Potter is chief strategy officer for both businesses, for example.

Who uses Tether?

""Anybody who's trading on some of the major exchanges [holds Tethers],"" Mati Greenspan, a market analyst with eToro, told Business Insider. ""What exchanges like Bitfinex do is, rather than having a client's balance held in dollars, they hold them in USDT. So if somebody's got their money on an exchange such as Bitfinex and they don't have any current open positions, they're actually probably in Tether.""

Many cryptocurrency exchanges have difficulty working with traditional banks, who are wary of working with crypto businesses. Tether offers a stable alternative, offering the low volatility of the dollar to both exchanges and users.

An industry source who didn't want to be quoted told BI: ""Tether is used by crypto-to-crypto exchanges as it allows them to price crypto assets in USD without having to maintain/own USD-denominated bank accounts – this is of particular interest to many platforms due to the difficulties involved in maintaining banking relationships in the crypto space.""

Tether's website says that it ""allows you to store, send and receive digital tokens person-to-person, globally, instantly, and securely for a fraction of the cost of alternatives."" Holding client funds as Tether means exchanges can cut down on transaction costs until a client wants to redeem their funds as dollars. Then, Tether can be exchanged for those dollars.

Traders also use USDT to lock in returns during times of volatility and also transfer funds from one platform to another.

Why are people worried?

The company that controls and issues Tether is meant to hold US dollar reserves to back up all of the Tethers that have been issued — a little like the Federal Reserve backstops dollars with gold. In theory, Tether holders can sell one USDT back to Tether Limited for $1.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationBut fears have emerged in the cryptocurrency community that Tether Limited doesn't hold sufficient currency reserves to back all the Tethers in circulation.

""The claim is — and the claim has been growing lately — that they're not holding those reserves,"" Greenspan told BI. ""They haven't been incredibly transparent about where they're holding them and how much they're holding in different places.""

The New York Times reported in November: ""One persistent online critic, going by the screen name Bitfinex’ed, has written several very detailed essays on Medium arguing that Bitfinex appears to be creating Tether coins out of thin air and then using them to buy Bitcoin and push the price up.""

A recent anonymous statistical analysis of Tether published online and circulated in the crypto community made the same claim, saying: ""It is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.""

The report claims that the printing of Tethers tends to coincide with a dip in the price of bitcoin, suggesting it may be being used to buy up cheap bitcoin.

""Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet,"" the analysis said.

The University of Texas at Austin's paper supports this conclusion. The two academics who wrote it looked at Tether activity over the last two years and concluded that the price patterns are ""most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis where Tether is used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices,"" and bitcoin specifically.

$850 million worth of new Tethers were printed in January alone and many market participants are worried about the pace at which new Tethers are being minted without proper documentation showing their backing.

Tether published an accounting document last September meant to verify its holdings but a lawyer told the New York Times that the phrasing of the document ""did not prove that the Tether coins are backed by dollars.""

Accountants Friedman LLP prepared that document and were auditing Tether's books fully, but the relationship ""dissolved"" in January.

What could it mean for crypto markets?

If there is a problem with Tether, it could have wider knock-on effects for the cryptocurrency market as a whole due to its central role in many exchanges.

""The issue is that the volumes against Tether have been growing lately,"" Greenspan said. ""If there aren't sufficient reserves in US dollars, then the price of Tether should not then be pegged to the US dollar and it'll just be decided by the market.""

The fear is that a collapse in the price of Tether could also bring about a collapse in the price of bitcoin and other crypto assets that people have been trading with USDT.

If Tether becomes untethered from the dollar then it will also cause problems for exchanges that use it as a proxy for client funds. This could potentially create liquidity issues and, in a worst-case scenario, force them to seek extra capital. Wired wrote this week: ""If traders lose faith in tether, they could end up triggering the crypto version of a bank run.""

What does the company behind it say?

Tether Limited has strongly denied all the accusations against it, insisting that it has the dollar reserves to back up all Tethers in circulation and saying it is using its funds properly.

The company said in a statement in December that it is aware of ""questions and doubts throughout the community"" but said it ""cannot disclose much about ongoing investigations,"" related to the hack in November.

It said that accusations it does not hold dollars to back up its cryptocurrency are ""uninformed and baseless"" but admitted that it ""cannot create or redeem tether for any U.S.-based customers at this time."" The company has hired a law firm to take legal action against the person behind the anonymous Bitfinex'ed Twitter account.

Tether told Business Insider in an emailed response to questions about its audit:

""We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved. Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame. As Tether is the first company in the space to undergo this process and pursue this level of transparency, there is no precedent set to guide the process nor any benchmark against which to measure its success.

""We remain committed to the process and, as we’ve consistently done, we will continue to provide material updates at the appropriate times.""

The company told Bloomberg in an email responding to the CFTC subpoena: ""We routinely receive legal process from law enforcement agents and regulators conducting investigations. It is our policy not to comment on any such requests.""

CEO JL van der Velde said in a statement addressing the University of Texas at Austin paper: ""Bitfinex nor Tether is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex.""

NOW WATCH: An early bitcoin investor explains what most people get wrong about the cryptocurrency",2018-01-10,https://qz.com/africa/1194006/bitcoin-in-nigeria-senate-warns-against-cryptocurrencies/,"The bitcoin boom in Nigeria is drawing opposition from its lawmakers.

The senate has asked Nigeria’s central bank and other regulators to “investigate the proliferation of bitcoin” and do more to educate citizens about ”the dangers” of the cryptocurrency.

Much of the lawmakers’ fears are based on recent events after Mavrodi Mundial Moneybox (MMM), a Russian ponzi scheme, became popular in Nigeria snapping up over two million users. After a strong run, during which the scheme awarded users with 30% interest rates per month, it collapsed in December 2016. Nigeria’s central bank estimates that users lost $50 million. In a bid to bounce back, MMM’s adminstrators urged what was left of its user base to trade in bitcoin rather than cash. It’s likely that the early association between the ponzi scheme and bitcoin tainted the cryptocurrency in the minds of many. That much was clear as lawmakers described the bitcoin using words like “a financial scam” and “unethical.”

In any case, the lawmakers concerns might be a little too late as bitcoin trading in Nigeria has skyrocketed with weekly bitcoin trade volume surpassing 1 billion naira ($2 million) in August 2017 on LocalBitcoin, a global bitcoin exchange. Local bitcoin exchanges have also emerged to serve a quick growing market. Beyond the formal exchanges, peer-to-peer trading via private groups on messaging apps has also become prominent.

While some speculators have tried to cash in on bitcoin’s recent price surges, for many Nigerians cryptocurrencies have proven popular for practical reasons. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer a way to get around the various restrictions and regulations on dollar transactions over the last 18 months by Nigeria’s central bank. For example users will pay for services online and send payment internationally using bitcoin since there were limits to how much naira could be exchanged for dollars at reasonable exchange rates.

The lawmakers’ motion comes just as Nigeria’s central bank appeared to be taking a more positive outlook to cryptocurrencies and began researching possible policy proposals in Oct. 2017. That’s in stark contrast to its stance back in Jan. 2017 when it warned local banks against trading in cryptocurrencies citing the danger of “money laundering and financing of terrorism.”

Elsewhere in Africa, last week, Kenya’s central bank governor dissuaded the growing uptake of bitcoin saying investing in the cryptocurrency is “dangerous”. Meanwhile, in Zimbabwe, citizens have turned to bitcoin as a store of value in light of the country’s struggling economy and banks’ limitations on transactions.",

Line Starting Crypto Business

The operator of Japan’s most popular messaging app, Line Corporation, officially announced its plans on Wednesday to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.

The company has established a subsidiary called Line Financial Corporation “as a follow-up to Line Pay” in order to “further reinforce its position in the financial business domain,” its announcement details, adding that:

Going forward, Line will use this new company as a base as it proceeds with preparations to provide a variety of financial services, including a place to exchange and transact virtual currencies, loans, and insurance – all from the Line app

Line Pay is the mobile money transfer and payment service linked to the Line chat app. Launched in 2014, it has signed deals with over 30 banks across Japan to allow instant transactions using its platform, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. In Wednesday’s announcement, the company claims that Line Pay’s registered users have reached 40 million and its global transaction volume last year exceeded 450 million yen (~US$4.14 million). However, the company has not confirmed whether its new cryptocurrency exchange will be integrated into Line Pay.

Application to Operate a Crypto Exchange

Since the Japanese Payment Services Act went into effect in April of last year, all companies seeking to operate cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA). So far, 16 crypto exchanges have been approved.

Line revealed on Wednesday:

The application process for registration as a virtual currency exchanger has already been started with the Financial Services Agency, and it is currently under review.

The company’s announcement came amid the FSA’s investigations of all cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan following the recent hack of one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges, Coincheck. The FSA typically takes two months to approve a registration, except for Coincheck’s application which it has been reviewing for over four months.

Regarding the Coincheck hack, president and CEO of Line Corporation Takeshi Uezawa commented that “security is Line’s priority,” NHK reported.

Line’s crypto exchange announcement came as its counterpart in South Korea rose to become the country’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume in just a few months. Upbit is an exchange backed by Kakao Corp which operates South Korea’s most popular chat app, Kakao Talk. While Upbit has over 120 coins listed due to its partnership with the US-based Bittrex, Line has not revealed how many cryptocurrencies will be supported on its platform.

Check our tools section.",2018-02-01 10:00:57+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/fact-or-fud-pressure-drives-crypto-markets-down-almost-20,"All of the top 50 cryptocurrencies fell by as much as 18.05 percent in the 24 hours to press time, Thursday, Feb.1, as fresh volatility in Bitcoin undermines previous sideways growth.

Cross-exchange data from CoinMarketCap shows the broad copycat effect of Bitcoin’s drop on altcoin markets. Only six altcoins in the top 50 had made 24-hour gains at press time, with these nonetheless trending downwards.

Bitcoin faces renewed pressure after India’s finance minister Arun Jaitley announced a crackdown on “illegitimate activities” involving cryptocurrency in his 2018 budget speech this morning.

Jaitley also stated that the government does not recognize crypto as legal tender and would seek to freeze out crypto from the “payments network”. However, industry participants claim his words do not mark any real change in India’s regulatory perspective.

Others, such as BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, decried negative press attention on India as “FUD”, short for fear, uncertainty and doubt.

Nonetheless, alternative viewpoints were enough to send Bitcoin below $10,000 again Thursday, with new lows centring just below $9600 on averaged readings. Bitcoin is trading at an average of $9,609 at press time, down almost 7 percent today.

Running parallel to the news from India is an ongoing narrative surrounding the impact of Tether’s token supply on Bitcoin prices.

After a curious second market reaction to news that Tether and associate exchange Bitfinex had received subpoenas from regulators in December, analysts are casting doubt on previous assumptions that Tether’s issuance was artificially raising BTC/USD rates.

“Given $USDT stores $2.2B in value — currently 0.4% of aggregate crypto value & 1.3% of total bitcoin value — have a hard time believing it could be systematically propping up these markets,” Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske wrote earlier Thursday in a series of tweets on the subject.",,https://www.theinertia.com/surf/the-surfers-guide-to-cryptocurrencies-and-bitcoin/,"You’d be forgiven for thinking Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a fad. Something like CrossFit, or vegans, or deep-fried Mars Bars. Maybe you believe what the mainstream media wants you to believe: Crypto is a bubble. Perhaps the recent crash has had Janet at the photocopier brimming with I-told-you-so’s and telling you that she “absolutely knew fake internet money was a scam!” But she’s wrong. Market corrections are healthy and normal, especially in emerging technologies.

Or maybe you still don’t have a clue what Bitcoin is or why you should give a whistling shit about it.

Don’t worry, you’re still in the majority.

But you should care about it. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to remold the entire world, including the surf industry. Blockchain technology could allow us to tear the whole thing down and rebuild it in our own image, in a way that benefits all of us.

Let’s start with Crypto 101, as far as possible in non-endemic, non-techy terms. I know you’re the Thinking Surfer n all, but some of this can get quite weedy. If you’re wondering what qualifies me to offer cryptocurrency advice free of charge then the answer is, honestly, not much. As is the way with emerging technologies, there are no current experts. But I have spent an aggregate of 500+ hours deeply researching cryptocurrencies. There is nothing stopping you from learning and investing as I have. A good place to start is this tutorial on how to buy bitcoin with paypal. Loads of people don’t know how to get started and so this a good thing to learn right away.

Cryptocurrency is a libertarian dream. It’s all there for you right now. I believe that its adoption will have a truly mindblowing impact on society. As such, I’ve taken the liberty of distilling my learnings and applying them to something I love: surfing.

First, take note of three things that will really help you:

1. Stop thinking of Bitcoin and its ilk as a substitute for money, because it’s called cryptocurrency.

A currency is simply an exchange of something you believe has value. Bitcoin and other cryptos are more effective than traditional money, yes, but that only skims the surface of their potential value.

Money is a cultural construct. It’s a store of value and a mechanism of exchange, but only because that’s what you’ve been told. There is no reason why we can’t have multiple forms of “money” that perform different functions. All it requires is that we believe in it and can record it in an effective and trustworthy way.

Cryptocurrencies can operate as money or they can represent pretty much anything else. A token might be worth a month’s electricity, an insurance guarantee, a healthcare treatment, proof of ownership, 23 bananas. Anything at all.

2. Forget Bitcoin. It’s not that important. Blockchain is what’s important.

The invention of the blockchain is the single most important thing about cryptocurrencies.

Let’s use the internet as an analogy. Think of Bitcoin as email. A very handy, early use case for the internet, but hardly the most mindblowing by today’s measures.

Just as email is only one application of the internet, so Bitcoin is just one application of blockchain technology. The internet doesn’t exist just for email, just as blockchains don’t exist just for Bitcoin.

In the very simplest terms, blockchain technology is a way for computers to communicate using cryptography to solve mathematical puzzles. Solving the problems creates proof of a transparent, immutable transaction. In other words, a transaction which cannot be faked, disputed, destroyed or altered.

And when you have a record of something that is indisputable, you then have a method of transacting with complete strangers without needing a trusted intermediary to process and validate the transaction. Not only that, but you also have a method of creating data that equates to proof of anything you like: ownership, history, promise, creation, time, authenticity, rules, law…anything.

Anything that can be recorded as data can be secured by a blockchain. And this is orders of magnitude better than being etched in tablets of stone. Blockchains trap data as if it were locked in an uncrackable, indestructible vault for all eternity. A vault that everyone can see through but never touch.

In short, blockchain technology is a game changer. In time, it will change the whole world. Blockchains have the potential to have more impact on human societies than the invention of the wheel, or agriculture, or the Internet.

If you enable a method of peer-to-peer transactions which is immutable, instant, and free, then you enable absolute freedom for all. Freedom from banks, from corporations, from governments…

Right now you are not free. You cannot trust the information you consume or the food you eat. You are tied to your mortgage, your employer, your bank, your identity, your nationality, your records, your devices, your data.

Unless you live an entirely solitary existence as a cave dweller, then the chances are you use the internet. And if you use the internet then you are partially owned by Facebook, Amazon, and Google. These three corporations control a dangerously gigantic chunk of the world’s data. Therefore they control the future. They are more powerful than governments, they have more say than authorities, and they have more wealth than entire countries.

So where am I going with this, and why is it relevant to surfing?

What if I told you that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could solve most problems you can think of in the surfboard building industry?

Let’s run through a few examples.

Problem: The pricing of surfboards is all wrong.

There’s a slim mark-up between what we pay and what boards cost to make in time and money. The craftsmen – the shapers, glassers, laminators, sanders, artists – none of them are adequately rewarded for their work. It’s barely financially viable. Cheap, mass-produced surfboards are drowning small-scale talented shapers. Mass production dilutes and cheapens the market.

Blockchain solution: Trustless, automated transactions between suppliers of raw materials and shapers saves money and time. Greater efficiency ensures everyone gets paid. A direct line of sale between the customer and the craftsman is possible instantly, from anywhere in the world. Distribution channels are streamlined or erased. Fewer middlemen exist. Distributors, shops, sales reps, banks – all are superseded by a blockchain. Therefore less money is paid to intermediaries and more remains for the board builders and the customers.

Slimmed down supply chains and free, instant international money transfers allow small-scale operations to have greater scope for expansion. Boutique shapers no longer need to worry about international currency conversions and can transact securely with customers across the globe just as easily as customers across the street.

Problem: Everyone steals or borrows each other’s ideas.

Inexperienced shapers simply undercut those above them, prepared to operate at a loss to get ahead. Boards are copied relentlessly from Instagram or stolen/shared/procured CAD files. The originators of new technologies, constructions or designs are unclear and the true benefactors are rarely rewarded.

Blockchain solutions: Every time a board is made, the data about that board is committed to a blockchain, where it stays, forever unaltered and transparent. An immutable record of who designed what and when. No copying, no piracy, no undercutting. Use of CAD files or other people’s designs could trigger Smart Contracts (algorithms which execute automatically) which means that the owner of the creative asset is immediately rewarded every time someone uses their design.

Of course, patents already protect intellectual property rights, but smart contracts make the process automated and foolproof and eliminate the potential for expensive, time-consuming litigation.

Sounds like pie in the sky, right? But all of this can happen now. The technology is here.

There are other, more creative solutions utilizing the same technologies, in surfboard construction and the wider surf industry. But you don’t expect me to give all my ideas away for free, do you?

Imagine a world with no middlemen. No corporations. No disputes about money, or ownership, or records, or promises. A world of truths and proofs and fairness. A world where the currencies we need are not controlled by faceless central authorities, but by us. A world which has parity for all.

And if that’s too much of a stretch, just imagine a world with cheaper, fairer surfboards. That’s a world we can all get behind.

Editor’s Note: Opinions expressed by contributors are their own. The author owns positions in Ethereum, Neo, Cardano, and several other cryptocurrencies.",,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cryptocurrency-regulation-2018-where-world-stands-right-now,"If 2017 was the year of the ICO, it seems as if 2018 is destined to become the year of regulatory reckoning. Things have already begun to heat up as countries around the world grapple with cryptocurrencies and try to determine how they are going to treat them. Some are welcoming, others are cautious. And some countries are downright antagonistic. Here is a brief overview of how 15 countries/unions from various regions are treating cryptocurrency regulations.



United States

The United States, at the time of this writing, has no coherent direction on its cryptocurrency regulation other than that there will be some soon. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has warned investors of cryptocurrency investing risks, halted several ICOs and hinted at the need for greater cryptocurrency regulation.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) became the first U.S. regulator to allow for cryptocurrency derivatives to trade publicly, then organized meetings to talk about possibly changing the rules for cryptocurrency derivatives clearing (one of the meetings was postponed due to the federal government shutdown).

Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin has indicated a preference for minted fiat currency over cryptocurrency. Speaking on January 12, 2018, at the Economic Club in Washington, D.C., Secretary Mnuchin warned those in attendance that he and other regulators were looking into the possibility that cryptocurrency could be used in money-laundering activities. The secretary then announced to the group that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) had formed a working group to explore the cryptocurrency marketplace and that he hoped to work with the G20 to prevent bitcoin from becoming a digital equivalent of a “Swiss bank account.”

Defending his stance to World Economic Forum attendees on January 25, 2018, Mnuchin explained that his number one focus on cryptocurrency was “to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities.”

On January 26, 2018, U.S. Treasury Deputy Director Sigal Mandelker echoed the secretary’s sentiments after a visit to China, South Korea and Japan. At a press conference in Tokyo, she applauded the three Asian countries for keeping tabs on cryptocurrency trading, stating, “We feel very strongly that we need to have this kind of regulation all over the world.”

It should be noted that non-U.S. investors may have concerns over clearing licensing hurdles put up individually by the states. If the U.S. treats cryptocurrencies as currency, it seems more likely that the actions by the federal government and federal regulatory agencies would preempt states’ licensing. However, if treated as “securities” (the SEC has not completely cleared the issue up), cryptocurrencies, especially ICOs, would have to clear “blue sky laws” on a state-by-state basis.

Canada

The Financial Consumer Agency in Canada does not consider cryptocurrencies to be “legal tender,” excluding all but Canadian bank notes and coins from that definition. The True North, however, is not all harsh on its cryptocurrency regulatory stances. In fact, it appears to be the most transparent country in this list when it comes to understanding laws surrounding the digital currency industry (aside from Switzerland, which wants to be “THE crypto-nation”).

After weeks of hearings, which included testimony from experts like Andreas Antonopoulos, the Canadian Parliament approved Bill C-31 on June 19, 2014, the world’s first national law on digital currencies. The Canadian government has been communicative in its regulatory stances on cryptocurrency ever since: the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) sent out a regulatory notice on August 24, 2017, confirming “the potential applicability of Canadian securities laws to cryptocurrencies and related trading and marketplace operations and to provide market participants with guidance on analyzing these requirements.” If you want a clear and concise interpretation of this notice, check out this article.

More recently, the head of the Central Bank of Canada, Stephen Poloz, was quoted as saying on January 25, 2018, that “I object to the term cryptocurrencies because they are crypto but they aren’t currencies … they aren’t assets for the most part … I suppose they are securities technically … There is no intrinsic value for something like bitcoin so it’s not really an asset one can analyze. It’s just essentially speculative or gambling.” It should be noted that as part of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), Canada joined an association-wide “cautionary directive” on the risks of cryptocurrencies, with all representatives from every province in the country believing there is a “high risk of fraud.”

Venezuela

Venezuela is not a major world economy or a large portion of the cryptocurrency investing community. The country’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies, however, is noteworthy because the government, under the restrictive regime of Nicolás Maduro, is seeking to skirt economic sanctions imposed on Venezuela by announcing its own oil-backed “petro” cryptocurrency.

Under Maduro, the country has been divided for years by protests and clashes between opposition parties and the government. Venezuela started off 2017 seemingly seeking to crack down on cryptocurrencies as the Venezuelan Bolivar remained relatively unusable. And even as recently as December 13, 2017, the Maduro government sought to regulate cryptocurrency mining as the newly minted superintendent of cryptocurrencies, Carlos Vargas, announced the compilation of a detailed registry of cryptocurrency miners in the country.

In a country where the fiat currency is worth little and sanctions from the U.S. continue to mount, a state-sanctioned cryptocurrency may cause Venezuela — a typically restrictive regime — to become one of the most progressive countries on cryptocurrency regulations (even if only to further sales of petro).

Japan

Japan isn’t particularly liberal toward digital currency regulation; it’s merely winning the race to attract the best from Asia’s cryptocurrency industry, as China and South Korea have been creating hostile/uncertain environments. Whether or not Japan will allow for a cryptocurrency-themed J-pop band, the Japanese government has certainly been more welcoming of cryptocurrencies than its Asian neighbors.

Recent events may have tempered Japanese enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, however. The hack of a Japanese exchange on January 26, 2018, resulting in the loss of $530 million worth of NEM coins, has prompted backlash from the community and closer oversight from the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

China

China has been taking ever-increasing actions to clamp down on all things cryptocurrency. Starting off by banning ICOs, China ordered a bank account freeze associated with exchanges, kicked out bitcoin miners, and instituted a nationwide ban on internet and mobile access to all things related to cryptocurrency trading. The People’s Republic of China appears to be the most stringent cryptocurrency regulator of the major economies regarding cryptocurrencies. This is an odd about-face given that, in 2017, Chinese bitcoin miners made up over 50 percent of the worldwide mining population and that cryptocurrency adoption in China increased at a rate higher than any other country.

Though strict, the regulatory actions of the People’s Republic of China, under the stewardship of Xi Jinping, makes contextual sense as the country has recently been focused on stemming capital outflows and stomping out corruption.

South Korea

Where to begin with South Korean regulation? The country boasted a significant cryptocurrency presence in the past and was initially thought of as the country of refuge from the crackdowns occurring in China late last year. However, discord surfaced in January 2018 amongst top Korean officials on future regulatory actions for the digital currency industry, with declarations, clarifications, misinformation and ultimately some limited implementation. The uncertainty and potential negative regulatory impacts have now been cited as the cause for marketwide sell-offs on Red Tuesday as well as on January 30, 2018, when Korean officials began enforcing a January 23, 2018, rule disallowing anonymous accounts from trading cryptocurrencies.

To add external regulatory drama to the political dissonance demonstrated by a government less than a year out from ousting their former president, regulatory prospects for South Koreans have also been hindered by New York State’s Department of Financial Services (DFS), as they reportedly requested customer information on accounts associated with cryptocurrency trading among six commercial Korean banks with branches in New York on January 26, 2018.

Singapore

Until recently, the finance and banking center of Asia has been relatively lax compared to many of its Asian counterparts on cryptocurrency regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), like many financial regulators, warned of risks of speculating in the cryptocurrency markets during the December 2017 peak in bitcoin prices. And Singapore’s International Commercial Court heard a trial that same month over a bitcoin trading dispute, seeming to legitimize the economic stakes in dispute.

On January 9, 2018, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said that “the country’s laws do not make any distinction between transactions conducted using fiat currency, cryptocurrency or other novel ways of transmitting value.”

MAS fintech chief Sopnendu Mohanty on January 24, 2018 did state that he does not foresee a Lehman Brothers-like financial meltdown with Bitcoin at this point in time, adding that there is “a great indication that regulators are getting serious about this whole cryptocurrency market.”

Mohanty also stated regulators would need to apply consumer protections for digital currencies like bitcoin for it to continue to grow. While there has been no statement yet from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the $530 million hack that attacked Japanese exchange Coincheck on January 26, 2018, targeted Singaporean-based NEM coins.

India

India, once viewed as a burgeoning, friendly environment for cryptocurrencies, has been clamping down on cryptocurrencies in 2018. India’s tough stance stems from similar concerns that other, more stringent regulatory regimes have cited: money laundering, illegal activity proliferation, sponsorship of terrorism, tax evasion, etc. While the cash-reliant country is facing stern regulations, participants of the local cryptocurrency industry do not believe India can “ban” cryptocurrencies through regulations in the same way China has.

Australia

In the wake of the August 2017 financial scandal surrounding the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Australian government sought to follow in Japan’s footsteps by strengthening its anti-money laundering laws and regulating digital currencies. This differed slightly from the view in 2015 that the Aussie government would seek a “hands-off” approach to cryptocurrencies. Still, the lack of more concise regulation has purportedly had a negative impact on the country as the end of 2017 saw Australian cryptocurrency brokers halt Australian dollar deposits. December 2017 also saw an issuance from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) which hinted at the way potential future regulation could go. The ATO guidance stated:

Transacting with bitcoin is akin to a barter arrangement, with similar tax consequences. Our view is that bitcoin is neither money nor a foreign currency, and the supply of bitcoin is not a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes. Bitcoin is, however, an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.

Australia, however, has supporters of digital currencies in government, as August 2017 saw senators from both major parties (Labor and Coalition) stepping forward to call on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to accept cryptocurrencies as an official form of currency. Therefore, the future of further cryptocurrency regulation remains uncertain but potentially industry-friendly in the land down under.

United Kingdom/European Union

While Brexit is scheduled to force the U.K. and the European Union to part ways in March 2019, the United Kingdom and the EU remain united in their plans to regulate cryptocurrencies. On December 4, 2017, The Guardian and The Telegraph reported that the U.K. Treasury and the EU both had made plans aimed at ending anonymity for cryptocurrency traders, citing anti-money laundering and tax evasion crackdowns.

The European Union plan would require cryptocurrency platforms to conduct proper due diligence on customers and report any suspicious transactions. Likewise, the Treasury of the United Kingdom stated that they are “working to address concerns about the use of cryptocurrencies by negotiating to bring virtual currency exchange platforms and some wallet providers within anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulation.” The Treasury did, however, add that “there is little current evidence of [cryptocurrencies] being used to launder money, though this risk is expected to grow.”

While one European Union commissioner, Pierre Moscovici, stated in an interview with Bloomberg on December 18, 2017, that the EU was not looking to regulate bitcoin, the commissioner’s statements seemed out of sync with prior and consequential messaging. Two days later, Moscovici’s message was seemingly countermanded by Valdis Dombrovskis, vice president of the European Commission (the Executive for the European Union), when he told reporters in Brussels that:

There are clear risks for investors and consumers associated to price volatility, including the risk of complete loss of investment, operational and security failures, market manipulation and liability gaps.

Calls for greater cryptocurrency regulations echoed across Europe in January 2018. On January 15, 2018, French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire announced the creation of a working group with the purpose of regulating cryptocurrencies. Similarly, Joachim Wuermeling, a board member of the German Bundesbank, called for effective regulation of virtual currencies on a global scale.

On January 22, 2018, Dombrovskis furthered his regulatory agenda for cryptocurrencies by writing three of the EU’s watch dogs warning them of a bubble in bitcoin. On January 25, 2018, embattled U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May joined the fray, echoing the sentiments of International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde and U.S. President Donald Trump. When speaking to Bloomberg during the World Economic Forum at Davos, the prime minister stated, “We should be looking at these very seriously — precisely because of the way they can be used, particularly by criminals.”

While the U.K. and EU have not announced finalized regulations of cryptocurrencies, an expected announcement is likely due in the spring.

Switzerland

Switzerland, known for its progressive attitudes toward individual rights in banking, has kept a similar attitude toward cryptocurrency regulation. The Western European country is conspicuously absent from the European Union and appears to have an open attitude toward the cryptocurrency industry.

Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, told reporters on January 18, 2018, that he wants Switzerland to be “the crypto-nation.” According to an article by the Financial Times, Jörg Gasser, state secretary at the Swiss finance ministry, stated, “We want it [the ICO market] to prosper but without compromising standards or the integrity of our financial markets.”

To that end, on January 18, 2018, the Swiss set up an ICO working group with an aim to “increase legal certainty, maintain the integrity of the financial center and ensure technology-neutral regulation.” The working group will report to the Swiss Federal Council by the end of 2018.

Russia

Russia, like South Korea, can’t seem to decide how it wants to handle cryptocurrency regulations. In September 2017, Russian Federation Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said the central bank was against regulating cryptocurrencies as currency (as a payment for goods and services) and against equating them with a foreign currency. This statement seemed to indicate a progressive hands-off approach was in store for the cryptocurrency industry in Russia.

However, on September 8, 2017, the deputy finance minister for the Russian Federation, Alexei Moiseev, told reporters at a Moscow financial forum that settlements of payments in cryptocurrencies “are not legal now.” The deputy minister continued, stating, “Obviously, now there is a legal vacuum, and accordingly it’s hard for me to say if these actions are legal or not.”

Until these statements, the position proposed by the Russian federation was to allow only “qualified investors” to deal with cryptocurrencies. Russian President Vladimir Putin sided with the position of the Finance Ministry on October 11, 2017, when the president said that the use of cryptocurrencies carries serious risks, being an opportunity for laundering criminal capitals, evading taxes, financing terrorism and spreading fraudulent schemes that would victimize Russian citizens.

The Finance Ministry continued its strict regulatory posturing by suggesting a taxation on cryptocurrency mining ventures on December 28, 2017. The new year began with even more hints at a Russian crackdown on cryptocurrencies, as Putin again sided with the Ministry of Finance on January 11, 2018, when he remarked that legislative regulation of the cryptocurrency market may be needed in the future.

President Putin stated, “This is the prerogative of the Central Bank at present and the Central Bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in the future.” (translation by TASS)

Two weeks later, on January 25, 2018, the Finance Ministry published a draft law “On Digital Financial Assets.” The law, if finalized, would define tokens, establish ICO procedures and determine the legal regime for cryptocurrencies and mining.

Presidential candidate Boris Titov decried the proposed legislation on January 26, 2018, stating that the draft law was excessively strict. According to Titov’s press service, “The Finance Ministry’s proposals present a much tougher regulation than in Japan, Switzerland, Belarus [and] Armenia; that is, in all countries that have adopted some form of legislation. It would be better not to adopt anything than to adopt such legislation.”

Further muddying the waters was a concession by Deputy Minister Moiseev that the December 2017 Belarusian adoption of the “Digital Economy Development Ordinance” could cause capital outflows from Russia to neighboring Belarus if heavy crypto-regulation occurred in the Russian Federation.

Nigeria

Last year saw Africa’s largest economy struggle through a recession that caused a “crunch” to its fiat currency. Bitcoin trading boomed as Nigerians used cryptocurrencies to end-run currency controls restricting access to the dollar put in place to curtail the recession. January 2017 started off with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) seeming to ban cryptocurrencies, only to have CBN Deputy Director Musa Itopa Jimoh walk back the position by stating, the “Central bank cannot control or regulate bitcoin. [the] Central bank cannot control or regulate blockchain. Just the same way no one is going to control or regulate the internet. We don’t own it.” Bitcoin trading boomed by 1500 percent during 2017.

Though the IMF report from December 2017 said the country has exited its recession, tepid GDP growth forecasts and reliance on crude oil exports make calls on January 25, 2018, from CBN Governor Edwin Emefiele to regulate cryptocurrencies seem tenuous. The CBN governor stated, “Cryptocurrency or bitcoin is like a gamble … We cannot, as a central bank, give support to situations where people risk their savings to ‘gamble.’”

Ghana

The governor of the Bank of Ghana, Dr. Ernest Addison, stated on January 22, 2018, that “Bitcoin is not yet legal tender” at a media briefing. While there is a bill before Ghanaian parliament which will allow for the use of cryptocurrencies (seemingly with companies registered as “Electronic Money Issuers” by the government), the current stance of bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) is, according to Graphic Online, one of “six countries that have outlawed [bitcoin].” Addison’s statements come weeks after a recommendation from the Ghanaian investment bank, Group Ndoum, suggested that the Bank of Ghana invest 1 percent of its reserves in bitcoin.

South Africa

South Africa is relatively progressive on the subject of cryptocurrencies compared to others on the list. While the 2014 position paper on virtual currencies issued by the South African Reserve Bank seemed promising for the industry, the South African government began in July of 2017 to work with Bankymoon, a blockchain-based solutions provider, on creating a “balanced” approach to bitcoin regulation.

The country has had valuation issues with its fiat currency, the South African Rand, being devalued several times over the past decade. The 2015 devaluation saw the rand drop 26 percent in response to the Chinese yuan devaluing by a mere 2 percent. Most recently, the country faced devaluation prospects again in March of 2017 as the president fired South Africa’s finance minister. The country has remained relatively mum on cryptocurrency regulation in January 2018, but it will be interesting to see if the reliance South Africa’s fiat currency has on China translates at all to its regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency markets are suffering from new lows on the first of February as nearly every digital asset is down 3-20 percent. Since the last week of December 2017, bitcoin core (BTC/USD) markets are seeing a continuous downward spiral not seen since 2014. At the moment BTC is desperately trying to climb above the $9K region at $8,950 but buying pressure is showing signs of some flat trade volume across the boards.

BTC /USD Markets See the Most Continuous Price Dumps Since 2014

Last week digital assets were at a crossroads and many bitcoin traders expected either one of two scenarios — either the dumps were over, or markets would continue to slide in value. Trade volume has been weaker this week as global markets are only swapping $8-10Bn during 24-hour trading session intervals.

The top five exchanges trading the most BTC include Okex, Bitfinex, Binance, Bitflyer, and Upbit. BTC trading with the USD has dropped significantly since last week as the Japanese yen now commands the top currency pair position. The yen leads by 47.8 percent which is followed by the USD (29%), tether (USDT 9%), euro (7%) and the Korean won (2.7%). The South Korean won’s volume with BTC has dropped considerably over the past two weeks. The most-traded digital asset right now according to Shapeshift is ethereum (ETH).

Technical Indicators

BTC/USD technical indicators show the decentralized digital asset has erased most of its gains over the sixty-day average. Cryptocurrencies are suffering the most continuous losses since 2014, and traders are uncertain about the current ‘true market value.’ The two Simple Moving Averages both short-term (100 SMA) and long-term (200 SMA) have converged once again on January 30. The 200 SMA is well above the short-term 100 trendline which indicates bears will relentlessly keep pushing the value towards the downside.

At the moment RSI and Stochastic have room to move northbound, and a spike could be in the cards today. Bollinger bands are incredibly tight which indicates an elastic-like rebound could also play out over the next 48-hours. However, traders believe it will likely be a bull trap with the current market sentiment and predictions of hitting the lower $8K regions ($8,200-8,400). Order books show some crucial foundations between $8,900 to $8,200 if things continue to fall to the back side. On the flip side, the upward path has less resistance all the way back to the $10K region.

Cryptocurrency Markets, In General, See Major Losses Except for Ethereum

Cryptocurrency markets, in general, are all in red minus a few digital assets. Ethereum’s value has been the strongest over the past two weeks even quietly touching an all-time high. At the moment the second highest capitalization held by ethereum shows markets are down 4.9 percent as one ETH has an average price of $1,050. The second highest valued cap still belongs to ripple (XRP) but markets are down 12.4 percent, and XRP is $0.98 per coin. Bitcoin cash (BCH) is following the downward trend as well as BCH markets are down 13.2 percent with an average of $1,285 per token. Lastly, Cardano ADA is down significantly, with prices seeing a percentage loss of around 16 percent. Cardanos are worth 0.42 per ADA at the time of publication.

Large Swathes of U.S. Investors Move to Equities Markets for Tax Cuts, While Crypto-Traders Try to Predict the Next Big Price Move

Market sentiment across the boards is extremely bearish right now, and many traders expected the lowerbound $8K zone to happen. Many believe most cryptocurrencies are in deep search of their ‘fair market’ values after rising so fast two months ago. Alongside this USD trade volume commanded quite a bit of trading but since the recent U.S. tax cuts for equities markets, new money has likely jumped to those investment vehicles. With the special incentives for tax cuts, U.S. equities markets have been on fire since the announcement this past week. Further, there’s been nothing but negative news tied to cryptos, and uplifting news doesn’t seem to be in the pipeline right now. For now, some speculators believe prices could still drop to $5-7K per BTC while others think there will likely be a big rebound either at our current vantage point or around $8,200-8,400 if prices sink that low.

This Wednesday Jack Dorsey, the CEO of the payment processing firm Square, revealed the company’s Cash App users can now purchase and sell bitcoin. Back in November the Square Cash App’s bitcoin functionality was only available to select individuals for experimentation. Now, most of the app’s users can access the ability to buy and sell the digital currency using the platform.

The Payment Company Square Says Satoshi’s Vision Is Having an Impact All Around the World

The merchant services aggregator and mobile payment company Square has announced its bitcoin feature is now available for most of its Cash App users. The news follows the company’s testing last November when it allowed select users to use the feature that enables individuals the ability to purchase BTC. Additionally, the firm’s CEO Jack Dorsey promoted the new app with a colorful blog post about bitcoin, and it’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. The story that describes the innovative technology concludes by saying:

That’s a lot to imagine, isn’t it? One thing is clear though: Satoshi’s vision is having an impact all around the world.

Square says the Cash App offers users the ability to send and receive BTC between family and friends. The company also emphasizes that bitcoin’s prices can be “volatile and unpredictable” and it asks its users to make “wise financial decisions.”

“We’ve made it just as easy to buy and sell BTC straight from your Cash App balance — Unlike other apps, most of our buys and sells happen in seconds, and you can even spend your proceeds from a free Visa debit card,” explains Square’s announcement.

Greater Financial Access for All

Jack Dorsey who also runs the company Twitter explains to his followers on the social media platform that instant BTC buying is now available.

“And selling, if you don’t want to ‘hodl’ — Bitcoin is now available to most Cash App customers,” Dorsey explains.

We support bitcoin because we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all — This is a small step.

Right now there are only four states that cannot access the bitcoin services on Square’s Cash App which include Hawaii, New York, Wyoming, and Georgia. Due to harsher cryptocurrency regulations, those states will not see the bitcoin feature available for the time being.

Check our tools section.",2018-02-01 11:55:14+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/samsung-confirms-its-now-making-cryptocurrency-mining-chips,"Samsung has confirmed it is now manufacturing specialized cryptocurrency mining chips after reports to that effect surfaced this week.

South Korean news outlet The Bell first revealed the news on Jan. 30, stating that Samsung was kicking off manufacturing in January, aiming to provide application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to an unnamed Chinese mining firm.

A company spokesperson has since told TechCrunch:

“Samsung’s foundry business is currently engaged in the manufacturing cryptocurrency mining chips.”

The South Korean tech giant, however, did not provide any details on its customers or the chips, TechCrunch states.

Still, in its recent fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results report yesterday, Samsung talked about the growing demand for cryptocurrency mining, stating that in 2018 it will provide 8nm and 11nm processors to meet market needs, as well as start a “risk production” of 7nm chips.

Samsung’s move into the cryptocurrency mining space will undoubtedly bring serious competition to China-based Bitmain, which claims to hold over 70 percent of the market share and uses ASICS from Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC.

So far only a few insurers sell such insurance, including XL Catlin, Chubb, and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. Yet several others told Reuters they are looking into theft coverage for companies that handle digital currencies like bitcoin and ether, which trade between anonymous parties.

Such efforts so far have garnered little attention, but the emergence of an insurance market marks an important step for the nascent industry’s mainstream recognition.

The risks are clear: digital currency investors have already lost billions from dozens of cryptocurrency hacks, technical errors and fraud. Many hacked exchanges later shuttered.

On Friday, Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck became the latest casualty, reporting a loss of around $534 million worth of coins to hackers.

For insurers the challenge is how to cover those risks for customers they know little about, who use technology few understand and represent a young industry that lacks troves of data insurers usually rely on in designing and pricing coverage.

Christopher Liu, who heads American International Group Inc.’s North American cyber insurance practice for financial institutions, said the answer is to find an established business with a similar risk profile and try to adapt what works there.

“It’s sort of akin to a digital armored car service,” he said about cryptocurrency firms. “If there is a problem – like an accident or a robbery – that’s going to be the accumulation of all these exposures.” Liu says AIG began researching cryptocurrency theft coverage in 2014 and has written a few such policies, but remains in an “exploratory phase.”

Greg Bangs, head of XL Catlin’s North America crime coverage underwriting recounts how the firm had to become its own expert on the new technology by talking to key players and potential clients before developing bitcoin theft insurance.

“The first challenge for us was to figure out if there was a product here.” XL Catlin now offers annual crime coverage of up to $25 million per incident, Bangs said.

Shady Companies

Knowing the customer also takes on special importance.

Jackie Quintal, who advises financial institutions for insurance broker Aon Plc, said part of her job is to tell legitimate digital currency companies from shady ones, something that often gets cleared up even before an insurer gets involved.

“If someone is hesitant to provide information and they don’t have answers to compliance questions, they tend to disappear on their own,” she said.

Still, insurers spend more time than usual scrutinizing everything from security and storage procedures, the scale of their operations, to the people involved – a process that can take several months.

“Some bitcoin exchanges and wallets weren’t anticipating the level of underwriting and due diligence that they undergo when they approach the market,” said Matt Prevost, who heads Chubb’s North American Cyber Product Line.

Insurers like Chubb are betting that cryptocurrencies will gain wider recognition even if the new business now represents only a tiny sliver of the global $720 billion per year commercial insurance business.

Digital coin sales raised more than $5 billion across nearly 800 deals in 2017, according to venture capital data provider CB Insights. There are no estimates yet how much of that has been insured or of total premiums collected.

Cool on ‘Hot Storage’

Many insurers remain wary of the new business. Some, like Great American Insurance Group, an American Financial Group Inc. unit, offer protection from employee theft to companies that accept bitcoin payments, but avoid outside risks, such as hacking. The company added the coverage to its standard employee theft policy in 2014.

Others will avoid coverage for coins kept online, or in “hot storage,” because of high risk of hacking and will only cover offline “cold storage,” which is also generally preferred by cryptocurrency companies. (Reuters graphic: http://tmsnrt.rs/2DNRkFu)

Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange available in 32 countries, says on its website it holds less than 2 percent of customer funds online and that those funds are insured.

Lloyd’s of London, the world’s largest insurance marketplace, was providing insurance to the exchange, according to a person familiar with the matter. Reuters could not determine the terms or the scope of the coverage and a Lloyd’s spokesman declined to discuss Coinbase.

He said that member companies have written a small number of policies for cryptocurrencies in recent years and Lloyd’s was requiring members to proceed with caution and use additional scrutiny of cryptocurrency companies.

Some insurers are not yet convinced the cryptocurrency business is large enough for premiums to cover possible losses.

“We’re looking at it, but does it make sense to offer a market for that?” said Frank Scheckton, president of Great American’s Fidelity Crime Division.

Right now, costs act as a deterrent for small firms and startups, said Ty Sagalow, chief executive of Innovation Insurance Group LLC, which has been developing coverage for cryptocurrency companies since 2013.

“It’s an expensive product that many companies can’t afford,” he said.

Annual premiums for $10 million in theft coverage would typically run at about $200,000, or 2 percent of the limit, insurance experts say. That compares with about 1 percent or less for traditional financial clients, depending on the company, loss history and other factors.

Currency volatility is another concern. While coverage limits shield insurers from wild swings, the impact for clients can be dramatic. For example, a $10 million policy signed in January 2017 would cover 10,957 bitcoins at the time, but only 923 if a hack happened a year later.

Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, argues insurance should not be an investor’s primary concern.

As a registered New York trust company, Gemini carries state-mandated insurance against employee theft, computer fraud, and fund transfer fraud, but has no coverage for hacking, Winklevoss, who founded the firm with his twin brother Tyler, said.

“The key is to look for regulatory oversight that ensures that an exchange is doing what it should be doing so that it doesn’t get to the point where you have to fall back on an insurance policy,” he told Reuters.

However, Henry Sanderson, who oversees cyber and technology coverage for Safeonline LLP, a Lloyd’s broker, argues cryptocurrency insurance can help the young industry mature while creating new business for insurers.

This whole space is maturing and growing,” he said. “If we don’t embrace it now, it’s a missed opportunity for insurers.”

Launching its new SafeWallet, the firm says the so-far Android-only wallet app is designed to be user-friendly, allowing customers to easily manage their cryptocurrency assets. An iOS version is slated to follow soon.

With SafeWallet users can send and receive cryptocurrency assets, create multiple wallets and import wallets in a variety of formats, a release says. The app currently supports bitcoin and ether, with more cryptocurrencies to be supported soon.

Cheetah Mobile, which specializes in security app products, states:

“SafeWallet employs a unique three-tiered security defense system that protects users in three key areas, including user behavior, phone security and asset management to provide maximum protection for users’ digital assets and prevent them from being lost or stolen.”

The company stressed that SafeWallet does not access users private key, or initiate transactions on their behalf.

Edward Sun, SVP of Cheetah Mobile, said, “Similar to our AI strategy, we are committed to staying at the forefront of the latest technological trends, and mobile asset security is an area that we believe we can have a strong impact.”

Cheetah Mobile already provides mobile security products such as Clean Master and Security Master, and currently claims that more than 100 million customers use its products daily.

The move comes as other mobile app makers seek to tap into the popularity of cryptocurrencies.

Just yesterday, CoinDesk reported that both Square and Line Corporation are adding cryptocurrency options and services to their current payment apps.

Messaging app Kik has even gone so far as to launch its own crypto token, called “kin,” aimed to power its ecosystem, as well as raise funds for the company.

After skyrocketing to a record $19,000 per bitcoin in December, the digital asset has endured a series of steep drops, drastic for even the notoriously volatile crypto trade.

Smaller cryptocurrencies were down, too, with Ethereum off more than 25 percent, Ripple down 30 percent and Bitcoin Cash down 24 percent at some points.

The cryptocurrency markets were joined by the U.S. stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 650 points on Friday, finishing its worst week in two years.

Those people who held on to their bitcoins enjoyed some relief, though, with bitcoin's price rebounding to trade around $8,700 as of Friday afternoon.

But the broader decline has stoked fears that bitcoin skeptics were right to call its rise a bubble. If bitcoin is a modern-day ""tulip mania,"" the bloom appears to be off the rose.

At least, that is, if you bought after late November, when bitcoin's rally turned it from a fringe technology into a hotly debated commodity.

""Anyone who bought before Thanksgiving is still playing with house money,"" Nick Colas at DataTrek Research, an analyst who's been covering cryptocurrency for over four years, told NBC News. ""Most long-term holders are still OK.""

Bitcoin's price is still up more than 760 percent in the past 12 months, with other cryptocurrencies seeing similar increases. But it can't be missed that over $100 billion has been wiped off the torrid crypto market in the past 24 hours.

The decline has erased gains for newcomers who had bet their pocket change, credit card lines or, in some cases, second mortgages on one of the most-hyped investments in decades.

Websites and apps, such as the popular Coinbase, made it accessible to buy bitcoin on a smartphone and credit card while waiting in line at the supermarket, turning everyone from schoolbus drivers and ironworkers to students and homemakers into amateur crypto day traders. Because crypto can be bought in fractional amounts, regular people can buy in for just a few bucks.

Experts cite a ""perfect storm"" of factors now driving down the price of the bitcoin.

Regulators are starting to make noise as the crypto craze and the eye-popping gains, over 1,000 percent for some coins, have caught their attention.

Even small moves from governments can set off a panic, as in South Korea when rumors spread that the government was going to ban cryptocurrency trading entirely. It later turned out that the government will allow such trading to continue, but will prevent people from being able to do so anonymously.

On Tuesday, news that U.S. regulators sent subpoenas to the virtual currency exchange Bitfinex and sister company Tether contributed to a 10 percent decline in Bitcoin prices that day, Bloomberg reported. Regulators in other countries, like India, have also added to the spate of reports.

For long-term holders, that's just part of the business, as the crypto market's rising popularity draws inevitable attention.

""Crypto investors will just have to get used to more critical headlines from regulators,"" Colas said.

And for the past three years a cryptocurrency slump has occurred in January, which some experts attribute to Asian customers pulling money out the market to buy gifts during Chinese New Year.

As selling increased, a ""buyer strike"" contributed to the price declines, Ronnie Moas, founder and director of Standpoint Research, told NBC News.

""The rug was pulled out from under bitcoin,"" Moas said. ""There were a lot of people trying to get out, from people who lost a lot of money in the past few weeks who decided they couldn't take it or people who made a lot of money who got in a year ago who wanted to lock in gains before they evaporated.""

Customers who used a ""stop loss"" mechanism, which are automated orders to sell when the price falls to certain lows, could have steepened the slide as well. That selling can in turn trigger further automated selling.

There's also some question of whether Bitcoin will remain the ""coin of the crypto realm"" and the one most investors put their cash in. Other currencies, especially Ethereum, have been catching up to Bitcoin's $140 billion market cap, adding further uncertainty and churn.

Despite the stomach-churning dips, Moas remains bullish on bitcoin.

""It can go to $100,000 and it can go to zero,"" he said. ""If you wait until the coast is clear, you'll have to pay $50,000"" in order to buy in.

""If you can't deal with the risk, reward and volatility, then put your money in a AAA bond,"" he said.",2018-02-02 21:43:07+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-bitcoin/bitcoin-tumbles-as-cryptocurrency-sell-off-intensifies-idUSKBN1FM11M,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cryptocurrencies plunged on Friday, with bitcoin at one point sliding below $8,000 and headed for its biggest weekly loss since December 2013, amid worries about a regulatory clampdown globally.

The currencies have come off their lows but analysts said the sell-off was probably not over.

This week’s slump brought the total market value of cryptocurrencies down to around $400 billion, half the high it reached in January, according to industry tracker Coinmarketcap.com. The market value of cryptocurrencies is calculated by multiplying the number of digital coins in existence by their price, although many question whether that is the right way to value them.

Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, fell as much as 15 percent on Friday to a two-month low of $7,625 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange BTC=BSP. It clawed back some losses and was down around 5.6 percent at $8,498 in late New York trading.

The virtual currency is down by close to 25 percent this week and almost 40 percent in 2018. It surged more than 1,000 percent though in 2017.

For some market participants, bitcoin may be down, but it is not likely to fade.

“Bitcoin has become, and will continue to be, primarily a speculative asset class,” said David Moskowitz, Co-founder and Director of Indorse, the decentralized social network for professionals.

He added that the recent drops in transaction fees have made it easier to use bitcoin for payments once again. And if a payment solution can help the congestion, bitcoin may once again become an effective payment network, Moskowitz said.

The second and third largest virtual currencies, Ethereum and Ripple, also plunged more than 20 percent at the session low, Coinmarketcap.com said. Ethereum was last down 13.2 percent, at $888.22, while Ripple last traded at 83 U.S. cents, down 14.7 percent.

Retail investors have poured money into digital coins, enticed by the huge run-up in prices. Regulators say cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and dangerous investments.

On Thursday, India vowed to eradicate the use of crypto-assets, joining China and South Korea in promising to ban parts of the nascent market where prices have boomed in recent years.

Social media website Facebook FB.O said this week it would ban cryptocurrency advertisements because many were associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices. U.S. regulators have sent a subpoena to two of the world's biggest cryptocurrency players, Bitfinex and Tether

A massive $530 million hack of a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange last week renewed worries about the security of the industry.

Critics of virtual currencies have called the run-up in prices a speculative bubble, but supporters of cryptocurrencies say short-term price volatility is to be expected, and the blockchain technology underpinning these assets maintains its power and value.

Going back to 2011 and including the current selloff, bitcoin’s price has been halved nine times on the Bitstamp exchange before recovering.

Cryptocurrency markets took a hammering Friday and have been on rocky ground over the past month. One key reason behind this is related to another cryptocurrency called tether and allegations that the people behind it are using tether to prop up the bitcoin market. Fears are rife that any collapse in tether could have huge ramifications for the bitcoin market. CNBC explains the story.

What is tether?

Tether is a cryptocurrency that its creators claim is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The idea is that it's much more stable than most digital coins that have huge price swings. It was invented in 2015 and theoretically a person would pay $1 for one tether coin. Currently, there are 2.2 billion tether in circulation, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com, a website that tracks cryptocurrency prices.

Who made it?

The digital coins are issued by a company called Tether Limited that is governed by the laws of the British Virgin Islands, according to the legal part of its website. It is incorporated in Hong Kong. It has emerged that Jan Ludovicus van der Velde is the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, which has been accused of being involved in the price manipulation of bitcoin, as well as tether.

What's the point of tether?

Many people trading on exchanges, including Bitfinex, will use tether to buy other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Tether Limited argues that using this method to buy virtual currencies allows users to move fiat in and out of an exchange more quickly and cheaply. Also, exchanges typically have rocky relationships with banks, and using Tether is a way to circumvent that. ""Exchange users know how risky it can be to hold fiat currencies on an exchange. With the growing number of insolvency events it can be quite dangerous. As mentioned previously, we believe that using tethers exposes exchange users to less counter-party risk than continually holding fiat on exchanges,"" the company explains in a whitepaper on its website.

So what's the controversy?

Firstly, many have raised concerns that tether is being issued by the people who own the Bitfinex exchange. Critics argue that there should not be such a close relationship. But the issues run deeper than that. Fears have been raised that Tether Limited doesn't actually hold enough U.S. dollars to back all the digital coins in circulation. These rumors have been circulating for a few months. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission sent subpoenas on December 6 to Bitfinex and Tether, citing an anonymous source. Tether has also been releasing more coins onto the market In January, alone Tether has released 850 million new digital tokens. The company has been increasing the number of coins in circulation over the past few months, and this has coincided with the record highs seen in cryptocurrency prices, causing some critics to suggest there is price manipulation going on. ""Over the past couple of months, a huge amount of tether has been created, it has shifted to the Bitfinex exchange and presumably buys bitcoin and other cryptos. This, I believe, has been keeping the price up,"" Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley, California, told CNBC by phone Thursday. To back these claims up, an anonymous statistical analysis posted online last week looked at the relationship between bitcoin price and tether. The conclusion was that tether is created when bitcoin is falling. ""Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8 percent of BTC's price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet,"" the analysis said.

What does Tether Limited say?

CNBC has reached out to Tether Limited for comment but has not received a reply. In September 2017, the company released a document entitled ""proof of funds,"" allegedly showing that it had the required reserves. However, it was far from clear and the names of the banks were blacked out. Furthermore, Friedman LLP, the accountancy that carried out the audit, has cut ties with Tether. According to a report from CoinDesk last week, the two parties had ""dissolved"" their relationship.

There are various reasons behind the panic currently gripping the crypto world – increased regulations, hacking, and crackdown by various governments. Additionally, the last leg of the rally looked frothy as traders gobbled up cryptocurrencies at crazy levels out of fear of missing out on the rally.

But when the mainstream media highlights negative news, investor sentiment is affected and some traders panic and dump their positions out of fear of losing their capital.

Some analysts believe that the bubble in cryptocurrencies has burst, while the others believe that the current fall is a great long-term buying opportunity.

We consider the recent fall as a great buying opportunity. However, all cryptocurrencies will not rise equally from their current levels, as markets will start distinguishing between different cryptocurrencies.

Therefore, we should look to buy stronger currencies that have fallen less and are bouncing off sharply from their key support levels.

Let’s explore which cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a pullback.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin is in a firm bear grip. It has declined about 55 percent from its high. With the recent fall, the cryptocurrency has retraced close to 78.6 percent of the latest leg of the rally. We find first signs of buying at $8000 levels.

In 2017, the RSI fell to the oversold levels (about 30) on three occasions and all of them proved to be a good buying opportunity. Presently, the RSI is close to the oversold levels. Therefore, there is a greater likelihood of a bottom formation around the current levels.

Aggressive traders can buy between $8,600 to $8,600 and keep a stop loss of $7,800. The pullback can lift the BTC/USD pair to the overhead resistance of about $10,700.

We anticipate another round of selling in the resistance zone of $10,700 to $11,300 (at the 20-day EMA). Therefore, traders should book partial profits at $10,500 levels and trail the rest. This is a risky trade and should be attempted with less than 50 percent of the usual position size.

The next leg down will confirm a bottom in the cryptocurrency, if it doesn’t break the recent lows of $8,000. If the lows break, the downtrend can extend to $6,000 levels. Therefore, we recommend that long-term traders should wait for a couple of days before buying.

ETH/USD

Our stop loss on the long positions in Ethereum was hit at $1,000. It could not escape the panic that has gripped the cryptocurrency market.

Today, the ETH/USD pair broke below the uptrend line, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It finally took support at $768, just below the panic low of $770 hit on January 17 2018.

The pullback from the lows is likely to face resistance at $1,025 levels. At the current levels, the risk to reward ratio is not attractive. Therefore, we are not recommending making any trades on this currency.

However, if the next fall towards the $820 to $770 level holds, we suggest long positions with a SL at $700.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash has completely retraced the last leg of the rally. It has slumped about 73 percent from its peak.

In our previous analysis, we forecasted that if the $1,364.9657 level breaks, a fall to $1,150 is likely and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $1,000 where buying emerged.

The pullback can carry the BCH/USD pair to the downtrend line, where we anticipate another round of selling.

Bitcoin Cash has been a laggard; hence, we want to see a further confirmation of a bottom formation before recommending any trade. We are most likely to recommend a long position if the support zone of $1,150 to $1,000 holds during the next fall.

XRP/USD

Ripple has taken the current fall on the chin. At the day’s intraday low of $0.61, it had declined 81.5 percent from lifetime highs of $3.317.

The momentum was so strong that the critical support level of $0.87, which had acted as a strong support on January 16 and January 17 also failed.

The XRP/USD pair fell close to the next support level of $0.61, which is the final support, below which, a fall to $0.24 is likely.

The current pullback should reach the downtrend line which should offer a strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive, so we don’t suggest any trade on it.

XLM/USD

Stellar has broken below the 50-day EMA. At the days intraday it also broke below $0.41 and fell towards the final support of $0.296.

Strong buying at the lower levels helped the cryptocurrency pull back above the critical support of $0.41. If the level holds, we may see a range bound action on the XLM/USD pair for the next few days.

Steller will likely become a buy once it breaks out of the upper end of the range at $0.64.

We are not recommending a buy today because a pullback of a single day cannot confirm a bottom.

LTC/USD

After breaking the critical support of $175, the bulls failed to hold the $140.001 levels and Litecoin fell to a low of $107.102.

Strong buying at the lows is likely to carry the LTC/USD pair towards the overhead resistance of $175.

However, the cryptocurrency has been weak and its logical support is way lower at $84.708. Therefore, we don’t recommend any long positions on it.

XEM/USD

NEM has declined about 74 percent from the highs. It has found some buying support at $0.45747, just below the critical level of $0.49.

The pullback should reach the downtrend line, which should offer strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive and the XEM/USD pair has been an underperformer. Therefore, we want to wait for a further confirmation of a bottom before cherry picking.

During the next retest of the low, if the $0.45 level breaks, a slide down to the next support of $0.3672 is likely.

NEO/USD

NEO broke below the symmetrical triangle on February 1 2018. Today (February 2), it fell close to the critical support level of $93.53 which resulted in strong buying by the bulls.

The pullback in the NEO/USD pair has reached close to the breakdown point of $132, which should offer a strong resistance level.

NEO is one of the stronger cryptocurrencies in the top 10 list because it is still quoting above the 50-day SMA.

We consider that it might be better to buy NEO during the next fall to $105 levels.

EOS/USD

We were expecting the trendline to provide some support, but the bears easily broke down below it. EOS found buying support at the $8.4 levels, close to the critical support zone of $7.5 to $6.5.

The EOS/USD pair is comparatively strong because it is also quoting above its 50-day SMA. Aggressive traders can buy on any dips towards $9 and keep a SL of $7.4.

The profit objective on the upside is a rally to $14 levels.

We recommend that the long-term traders, however, should wait for a buy set up to form before initiating any long positions.

Note: - Bottoms are not formed in a single day. After such a steep decline, we are likely to see a pullback and a few days of volatile price action. Therefore, we have suggested only a few trades and that too only for the aggressive trader.

The long-term traders should wait for a successful retest of the lows before buying.

Bitcoin is a tool for terrorists and money launderers. At least that’s what your elected officials believe. When western leaders are pressed for their thoughts on cryptocurrency, that’s invariably the first sound bite to leave their lips, followed, occasionally, by a begrudging acknowledgement that “the underlying blockchain technology has potential”. But as the case of the $400 million of NEM stolen from Coincheck last week shows, laundering huge amounts of cryptocurrency is surprisingly hard. Laundering fiat currency, on the other hand, is extremely easy when you know how.

Also read: New Research: Laundering of Illicit Funds Less than 1% of Bitcoin Transactions

Coincheck, NEM and the Curse of the Tainted Crypto

After successfully extracting over $400 million of NEM from Coincheck’s hot wallet last week the hackers must have been ecstatic. In a single transaction they had pulled off the biggest digital heist of all time. Those smug grins swiftly gave way to frowns however as the thieves pondered the best way to offload their ill-gotten gains.

In the real world, there is no blockchain to monitor the movement of U.S. dollars in real-time. Laundering cash in small amounts is as easy as walking into a casino, and in larger amounts easier still if you have a cash-based business for that express purpose. But on the web, the blockchain sees and records everything, making it easy for observers to monitor the movement of stolen funds as they are disbursed. In the last few days, the NEM hackers have started moving their haul, but are encountering major difficulties in finding an exchange that will accept it.

Blacklisted on the Blockchain

In the wake of the Coincheck hack, NEM elected not to issue a hard fork to isolate the stolen coins and render them worthless. Instead it began contacting exchanges with the wallet address the stolen currency was sitting in, seeking to have it blacklisted. With 33 exchanges accepting NEM deposits, the hackers shouldn’t be short of options in theory. However, only eight of these recorded NEM trading volume of over $1 million in the last 24 hours. Laundering the proceeds, even if the hackers are able to find an exchange that will take them, could take some time. NEM’s Jeff McDonald told Reuters: “[The hackers are] trying to spend them on multiple exchanges. We are contacting those exchanges”.

In an effort to avoid scrutiny, the hackers have begun breaking the coins down into 100 XEM batches (currently worth around $55) in new wallets. Dividing 500 million coins into 100-coin bundles – even if automated – is a laborious process. It’s likely that some of the stolen NEM will enter circulation one way or another, but the chances of even 1% of the proceeds being laundered in such a manner seem remote. “I would assume that they are going to get away with some of the money,” conceded McDonald.

Laundering Crypto is Hard

Cryptocurrency is not the money launderer’s paradise it’s portrayed to be. Last week it was the turn of British Prime Minister Theresa May to break her silence on cryptocurrencies, predictably venturing that closer scrutiny was required “precisely because of the way they are used, particularly by criminals”. When Donald Trump’s Treasury Secretary gave his first comments on bitcoin back in November, it was to echo similar sentiments, saying:

The first issue is to make sure people can’t use bitcoin for illicit activities. So we want to make sure that you don’t have the dark web funded in bitcoins and that’s something that is a concern of ours today. So, if you’re a bitcoin dealer in the United States, you have the same know-your-customer requirements and BSA requirements.

When political leaders assert that cryptocurrency must be regulated due to money laundering concerns, what they really mean is “We’re largely powerless to prevent fiat currency laundering so we’re going to focus our efforts on cryptocurrency instead”. Due to the nature of public blockchains and the need to cash out into fiat, cryptocurrency is easier to monitor. All the noise about “anonymity” and criminals “hiding on the deep web” is just that. In reality, laundering red hot cryptocurrency, unless it’s a privacy coin like monero, is fiendishly tricky.

A recent report tracking the circulation of funds within the bitcoin economy from 2013 to 2016 concluded that less than 1% of bitcoin transactions stemmed from coins of illicit origin. In comparison, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP – or $800 billion to $2 trillion – in U.S. dollars is laundered annually. Not only is cryptocurrency harder to launder at scale, but its prevalence is significantly lower than fiat currency. Just don’t expect your government to tell you that.

Japanese authorities on Friday raided virtual currency exchange Coincheck, a week after the Tokyo-based firm lost $530 million in cryptocurrency to hackers.

The raid comes as bitcoin dipped below $9,000 for the first time since November after India said Thursday it would take measures to prevent the use of cryptocurrencies.

The search of Coincheck's headquarters in Tokyo's Shibuya district was carried out by the Financial Services Agency, which had already slapped the company with an administrative order following the hack.

""We have launched an on-site inspection to ensure preservation of clients' assets,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso said at a briefing.

Japanese officials have suggested Coincheck lacked proper security measures, making itself vulnerable to theft.

The January 26 hack, which saw thieves syphon away 523 million units of the cryptocurrency NEM, exceeds the $480 million stolen in 2014 from another Japanese virtual currency exchange, MtGox.

Earlier this week, Japan's FSA gave Coincheck until February 13 to investigate the cause of the incident, ""properly"" deal with clients, strengthen risk management and take preventive measures.

Coincheck has said it will use its own funds to reimburse all 260,000 customers who lost holdings, at a rate of 88.549 yen per NEM.

The refund, which will be paid in yen, not virtual currency, will set the firm back about 46.3 billion yen ($422 million).

In the wake of the MtGox scandal, Japan passed a law on cryptocurrencies that requires exchanges to be regulated by the FSA. The law went into effect in 2017.

Coincheck had submitted an application to the FSA for a licence and was allowed to continue operating while it awaited a decision, the agency said.

Japan is a leading market for cryptocurrencies, with nearly a third of global bitcoin transactions in December denominated in yen, according to specialist website jpbitcoin.com.

Virtual currencies are popular elsewhere in Asia, including South Korea and China, but India's government on Thursday said it would crack down on their use.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in his annual budget, said New Delhi would ""take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system"".

Bitcoin, which soared to nearly $20,000 a unit in December, was down at $8,800 on Friday, while other digital units such as Litecoin and Ethereum have also suffered massive losses from their recent peaks.

© 2018 AFP",,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/bitcoin-biggest-bubble-in-history-says-economist-who-predicted-2008-crash,"The economist credited with predicting the 2008 global financial crisis said a 12% fall in the value of bitcoin on Friday was the latest proof that the cryptocurrency was the biggest bubble in history and destined for a crash.

Nouriel Roubini, professor of economics at New York University, said bitcoin was “the mother of all bubbles” favoured by “charlatans and swindlers” as it fell below $8,000 (£5,600) early on Friday, marking a 30% drop since the beginning of the week as investors became increasingly twitchy about a clampdown on cryptocurrencies by regulators. Later it rallied, climbing back over $8,600 by 3pm (GMT).

Bitcoin has lost more than half its value since hitting a peak of near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. Dubbed “Dr Doom”, Roubini said the sharp fall was the beginning of a crash that would see the value of the digital currency plummet “all the way down to zero”.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Hide Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.



The latest sell-off follows reports that US regulators are investigating whether the spike in the price of bitcoin in 2017 was the result of market manipulation. India’s finance minister said the country did not recognise the cryptocurrency as legal tender, pledging to fight their use for “illegitimate activities”.

Digital currencies have also been hit by the news that Facebook is banning all adverts for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum, ripple, litecoin and other digital currencies all suffered double-digit percentage falls on Friday as investors took fright.

“Policymakers and regulators are getting worried. Pretty much every G20 policymaker is talking about a crackdown,” Roubini told Bloomberg Television. “We can’t allow it to become the next Swiss bank account for use by criminals and people evading tax.”



He added that the 1,300 cryptocurrencies or initial coin offerings currently in existence were “a scam”. “Most of them are even worse [than bitcoin] and don’t have any intrinsic value like bitcoin. So if bitcoin is a bubble, it’s a bubble to the power of two or three.”

Critics have warned that bitcoin has all the hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble that could burst, like the dotcom boom and the US sub-prime housing crash that triggered the global financial crisis. Last year it rose in value by more than 900%, making it the best performing asset of 2017.

Robert Shiller, the Nobel prize-winning economist, said last week that while bitcoin was a “really clever idea”, it would not become a permanent part of the financial world.

“I tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it’s not a permanent feature of our lives,” he said, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Bitcoin is not recognised by any central bank and currently allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods to pay for goods and services. Banks and other financial institutions have been concerned about bitcoin’s early associations with money laundering and online crime, and it has not been adopted by any government.



However, the spike in the price is forcing regulators and institutions to consider how to respond.

Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, has said that bitcoin is too small to pose a risk to the global economy. However, he warned that investors should “do their homework” before backing the digital currency.

“The wheels are coming off the bitcoin bandwagon,” said Neil Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital. “The regulatory crunch appears closer than ever and sooner or later this market could be headed back down to earth. Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late. Trying to catch the falling knife is a risky game.”

Bitcoin faces a global backlash from regulators and governments

India’s finance minister said this week that the country does not recognise cryptocurrencies as legal tender and would take action against their use in funding “illegitimate activities”.

US regulators are investigating the Bitfinex exchange and a cryptocurrency company called Tether. They are questioning whether tether, whose coins are used to trade digital currency, are backed by US dollars as it claims.

Facebook has banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrency adverts on its site.

South Korea announced at the end of December that it was planning a crackdown on trading in the digital currency, preparing a ban on opening anonymous cryptocurrency accounts and new legislation to enable regulators to close coin exchanges if they felt there was a need to do so.

UK prime minister Theresa May said last week she was concerned that criminals were taking advantage of digital currencies. “In areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,” she said.

Additionally, it's important to note that most personal finance experts suggest you live by the 50-30-20 rule, by which ""50 percent of your income goes towards necessities, 30 percent towards discretionary spending and 20 percent towards saving."" In that case, you'd consider investing some percentage of that 20 percent you're saving, as opposed to the full 10 percent of your income that Finman recommends — and in a diverse portfolio, not just in high-risk investments like cryptocurrency.

While Bitcoin is the dominant virtual currency that grabs much of the attention, there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies out there, some of which are also popular and relatively high-profile such as Ethereum and Ripple. But there are many lesser known virtual coins, too; literally thousands of them.

While it remains relatively uncommon to actually purchase anything with these virtual currencies, there’s still plenty of money that could potentially be made with these more obscure coins that have been likened to the ‘penny stocks’ of the cryptocurrency world – and the right one could be due for a meteoric rise.

Here are six potential contenders which could be on the verge of heading up, up and away, but as ever, note that you make any investment in this volatile arena at your own risk.

1. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)

Bitcoin Cash was forked from the original Bitcoin in August 2017, and currently has a market cap of $28 billion (£20 billion). The goal was to create a newer version of Bitcoin with a larger block size, as the original was limited to 1MB, which in turn limited the network to processing Bitcoin transactions at only seven per second, a severe restriction as Bitcoin increases in popularity.

The creators view Bitcoin Cash as the next step on in terms of the evolution of the virtual currency, offering the promise of faster peer-to-peer transactions, with lower processing fees. The ultimate goal of Bitcoin Cash is to be actually useful as a digital currency for purchases in the real world.

2. Litecoin (LTC)

Litecoin dates back to 2011, and was created by ex-Google engineer Charlie Lee. It is often thought of as the ‘little brother’ to Bitcoin – a kind of silver to Bitcoin’s gold, if you will – with a current market cap of $10 billion (£7 billion), and a hard limit of 84 million Litecoin ever to be issued.

Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that allows for peer-to-peer transactions. However, Bitcoin is based on the SHA-256 algorithm, while Litecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm, which runs considerably faster, with a target of 2.5 minutes for each new Litecoin block (Bitcoin takes 10 minutes for each new block).

The result is that Litecoin boasts faster transactions, and at a lower cost compared to Bitcoin, which are certainly favorable points when it comes to Litecoin’s potential growth.

3. Monero (XMR)

Monero is an open source, crowdfunded approach to cryptocurrency, which dates back to July 2012. It was originally called Bitmonero, but this was subsequently shortened to the current name. Monero is a decentralized virtual currency based on the CryptoNote algorithm, with a new block added every two minutes, meaning it offers faster transactions than Bitcoin.

Another advantage of Monero, compared to Bitcoin, is that Monero is fungible, and therefore transactions are private, and there are no ‘tainted’ coins. Finally, Monero is resistant to ASIC mining, so it’s not as easily mined by professional mining companies, which keeps it decentralized.

4. IOTA (MIOTA)

IOTA is getting some attention these days, following its release as an alternative cryptocurrency back in 2014. The name derives from ‘Internet Of Things Application’, and this virtual currency was developed for a future where IoT devices trade their resources and services directly with each other, and IOTA is used for the payment. It’s a cryptocurrency which was designed to offer efficient, low-cost microtransactions.

Other cryptocurrencies are based on the blockchain, with recent transactions bundled into the new block. IOTA takes an alternative approach via a Directed Acrylic Graph (DAG) which is called Tangle.

In order to perform a transaction via IOTA, the user has to participate in the network, and they do this by verifying the last two transactions. This allows IOTA to offer free transactions, and furthermore allows it to scale – because as it becomes more popular, there will be more folks to verify transactions.

As the world of cryptocurrency matures, and transitions from a mere investment vehicle to being used to make real-world payments, IOTA’s unique approach and free transaction fees, especially for micropayments, mean it’s well positioned. Another point to note is that IOTA cannot be mined, as all IOTA was created in a single original transaction.

5. Cardano (ADA)

Cardano is a relative newcomer, having been released in 2017 following a lengthy ‘initial coin offering’ from 2015. Considered a third-generation cryptocurrency, its name comes from Gerolamo Cardano, a Renaissance figure who was an Italian mathematician and physician. Its founder is Charles Hoskinson, who was a co-founder of Ethereum.

Cardano is blockchain-based, and takes a scientific approach to cryptocurrency, being based on published academic papers with academic institutions overseeing its growth and evolution. Their goal is to balance the needs of regulation, while still adhering to privacy and decentralization principles.

This virtual currency also features the Ouroboros ‘Proof of Stake’ (PoS) method for faster transactions, which is laudably energy-efficient. Furthermore, it’s considered highly secure, as it’s based on a layered architecture. Cardano is an ambitious project that seeks to address the shortcomings of Ethereum and other older cryptocurrencies.

Thus far, Cardano certainly seems to be doing something right, as it has quickly become the fifth biggest cryptocurrency going by market cap value (behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash respectively).

6. Vertcoin (VTC)

Vertcoin was launched in 2014, and is similar to Bitcoin and Litecoin, although it’s certainly not as well-known. Vertcoin is open source, decentralized, and has a block time of 2.5 minutes. It also endeavors to be ‘the peoples’ coin’.

In other words, Vertcoin wants to avoid control by banks or other centralized mining powers. It incorporates ASIC resistance, meaning it’s designed to avoid being dominated by mining farms, allowing everyone the opportunity to mine using simple consumer graphics cards.

Vertcoin also utilizes the Lightning Network for instant blockchain transactions. Additionally, the Lightning Network has the ‘Atomic Cross-Chain’ which allows Vertcoin to be exchanged directly into either Litecoin or Bitcoin, decentralizing the exchanges. The creators are also working on ‘Stealth Addresses’ which allows them to provide privacy within the public ledger of the blockchain.

Two other factors contribute to the popularity of Vertcoin. The first is that it has an active community on social media sites, and the other big plus is that it’s easily mined by novices using one-click software, making it highly accessible.",2018-02-03 10:00:19.330000+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-america-becomes-latest-credit-card-issuer-ban-bitcoin/,"Bank of America Becomes the Latest Credit Card-Issuer to Ban Bitcoin

U.S. banks really aren’t big on bitcoin. That’s the inference to be drawn from a widespread crypto crackdown led by major financial institutions. Bank of America, the country’s second largest bank, is the latest player to give bitcoin the thumbs down, joining JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup in seeking to distance itself from cryptocurrency purchases made with credit card. In addition, Visa and Mastercard are now classifying Coinbase deposits as “cash advance” instead of “purchase”, adding an additional 5% fee.

Banks and Bitcoin Don’t Mix

For all the progress bitcoin has made in gaining mainstream recognition over the past 12 months, there’s a growing sense that the world of traditional finance is pushing back against cryptocurrency. That’s not to say that major banks feel directly threatened per se. Nevertheless, the climate is very much one of mistrust, caution and self-preservation, in keeping with the conservative nature of these age-old institutions. If bitcoin is to prosper, it will need to do so without the support of many of the financial organizations that are capable of providing an onramp to the world of decentralized currencies.

As of Friday February 2, Bank of America has stopped accepting credit card transactions from cryptocurrency exchanges. While debit cards are believed to be unaffected, customers of exchanges such as Coinbase will no longer be able to purchase crypto with credit card. As news.Bitcoin.com has previously reported, the growing number of people purchasing bitcoin on credit, a trend which peaked amidst December’s price rally, is a high-risk move that’s been widely criticized.

Thus, the decision made by Bank of America and Citigroup, which also announced it would be following suit on Friday, is defensible from a business perspective. These companies are trying to protect themselves against customers recklessly borrowing to buy bitcoin and then finding themselves unable to pay off their debts should the cryptocurrency plummet in price, as has proven to be the case. The news follows in the wake of a Europe-wide crackdown on crypto debit cards, orchestrated by a Visa subsidiary, and comes amidst a climate of increased regulatory pressure on cryptocurrencies as a whole.

Visa and Mastercard Reclassify Crypto

While Visa and Mastercard customers can still purchase cryptocurrency from exchanges such as Coinbase as it stands, they’re about to start paying more. Cryptocurrency is now classified as “cash advance”, similar to the status of a credit card ATM cash withdrawal. This means that an additional 5% fee will be incurred. Given that a $5,000 purchase of bitcoin from Coinbase with Visa would now cost around $250 in fees, this decision is likely to signal the end of credit card crypto purchases for most investors. Debit card purchases will not be affected though.

Bittrex Gains a Bank as Cryptopia Loses One

In a podcast on Friday, Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara confirmed that the U.S. exchange will soon be enabling fiat currency deposits in U.S dollars. The move has been interpreted as a desire on behalf of Bittrex to free itself from the increasingly tainted brand of Tether. At present Bittrex, together with fellow U.S. exchange Kraken, is reliant on tethers as a form of pseudo-fiat currency. In light of the news that U.S. officials subpoenaed Tether last month, it’s logical that Bittrex should want to free itself from being solely reliant on tethers.

Other exchanges haven’t been faring so well in the banking stakes however. Last week, New Zealand’s Cryptopia exchange announced that its domestic banking services had been withdrawn at short notice, writing: “Unfortunately, our current bank has notified us that they intend to close our NZDT account on 9 February. Due to this, we are announcing an immediate halt to NZDT deposits from COB today.”

Cryptopia also spoke of receiving “extremely short notice from the bank” and “little opportunity to present our case and provide compliance documentation to demonstrate our commitment to the applicable regulations”. In what may be a dig at Bitfinex, whose ever-changing and ever-opaque banking provisions are well-documented, Cryptopia added: “Whilst some exchanges choose to operate by opening bank accounts without being transparent (and running these until they get shut down), we believe this exposes us and our customers to greater risk and uncertainty.”

Despite growing interest in cryptocurrencies, getting money in and out of exchanges remains as hard as it’s ever been. It was that way in 2013, when banks scarcely knew what bitcoin was, and it’s still that way in 2018. Banks know all about bitcoin now but the vast majority want nothing to do with it.

Hong Kong-based media have reported that the country’s major search engines and social media networks do not appear to be presenting paid adverts for products or companies associated with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Reports have alleged that the censorship of cryptocurrency ads may date back to the announcement that The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would ban initial coin offerings (ICOs) during September 2017.

Chinese Online Media Platforms Ban Crypto Ads

A report published by Hong Kong-based media outlet, South China Morning Post, has alleged that leading Chinese search engines and social media platforms have stopped displaying sponsored posts and paid advertisements relating to cryptocurrencies.

The report states that keywords such as ‘bitcoin’, ‘cryptocurrency’, and ‘ICO’ appear to predominantly elicit journalistic content when searched on popular Chinese platforms Baidu and Weibo, whilst yielding an apparent absence of sponsored content. Weibo has confirmed that it does not presently allow advertising relating to cryptocurrencies, whilst Baidu is yet to comment on the matter.

Analysts are speculating that the censorship of crypto ads may have begun following the introduction of the PBOC’s crackdown on ICOs in September 2017.

Facebook Follows China’s Lead

The report was published just days after Facebook introduced new rules banning “ads that promote […] binary options, initial coin offerings, or cryptocurrency.” The social media network accuses said ads of “promot[ing] financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices,” claiming that “there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.”

The crypto community appears to have largely welcomed Facebook’s new policy, with many bitcoin veterans viewing social media as an advertising medium embraced by Ponzi schemes and opportunists seeking to cash in on the speculative boom surrounding virtual currencies will little intention of delivering robust services or platforms.

The digital currency started off in 2017 with a value of around $800, but, by the end of the year, was probably the highest-performing investment anyone could have ever made, as it reached dizzying heights of $19,783 in December. Such gains are enough to make the most well-heeled Wall Street sharks giddy with glee.

However, on the flipside, there has been a lot of concern recently that cryptocurrencies might be a bubble that could burst any day, crumbling the fortunes of many would-be investors and sending the markets reeling. On January 17, bitcoin’s value suddenly halved as futures contracts on the cryptocurrency expired, sending shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market that buffeted even top performing “alt-coins” like ethereum and ripple.

While bitcoin’s central role in the crypto market is undeniable, it is arguably in its own speculative bubble within the larger market, which contains more stable alt-coins. If bitcoin’s bubble was to burst, it would inevitably stagger the $700bn market, as it occupies about a third of it. Also, many exchanges use bitcoin to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies or to convert them back into fiat. But investors are now diversifying their portfolios by buying other, arguably more stable cryptocurrencies that could absorb any blows that may shake the bitcoin pillar.

But what makes these other cryptocurrencies any different from bitcoin? Are they not just other bitcoins, only carrying different monikers? The answer to that lies in the technology used to validate bitcoin transactions, known as blockchain.

Blockchain as a service

Like peer-to-peer (P2P) networks where unidentified people upload and download music and films, the blockchain depends on a growing community of people and institutions online. Those peers run bitcoin software to verify bitcoin transactions, independent of any bank or treasury. Every time people exchange bitcoin online, the whole network gets updated with the new information, creating new “blocks”, ie long chains of data for computers to solve.

In its simplest form, a blockchain is “a distributed open ledger that can record transactions between parties quickly in a verifiable and permanent way”. As the data held on a blockchain is decentralised and immutable, it builds trust that “what you see, is what you get” as any retroactive changes to the chain will be immediately obvious.

{articleGUID}

Such technology lends itself to business transactions and the keeping of verifiable records. It may also be a vision of the future, as more and more major companies are adopting the technology, bringing it into the mainstream. While the current crypto craze is seen as a “nerds only” endeavour, businesses and even governments around the world are waking up to its possible applications, with major shipping firm Maersk and technology giant IBM announcing earlier this month that they will create their own blockchain.

Even Disney developed its own private blockchain in 2015, which has now evolved into dragonchain, a new competitor to number two cryptocurrency, ethereum.

Similarly, the Chinese government – which is notoriously strict on cryptocurrencies – has teamed up with a little-known but up and coming firm called VeChain. The company specialises in authentication and verification technologies, allowing sellers using its blockchain to provide assurance to their customers that they are buying what they are paying for. For instance, a car could be tracked from the production of its parts and where it was assembled, to the taxes, sales and any resales of the car. It also has implications for ethical standards, as the blockchain could verify the labour used to produce goods, and the payment for that labour.

Governments could also keep track of companies and how much tax they ought to be paying. As VeChain’s CEO Sunny Lu told me at a recent blockchain event in London, governments have numerous departments and each interacts with numerous stakeholders, whether taxpayers or contractors. By using blockchain, governments can not only ensure that accurate records are kept, but that there will always be a clear audit trail that would make it harder for corruption to slip through the cracks.

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are here to stay

While this may just sound like dull news one might find in a financial newspaper, its implications for everyday people are major. With blockchains, things as mundane as medical records, identity documents and even qualifications and credentials could be stored and verified easily, scrapping a lot of the day-to-day grind of dealing with the bureaucratic systems of modern life, and allowing employers to make sure that a person’s CV, for instance, is not merely a fanciful story tailored to get a job.

Due to cryptocurrencies being used as decentralised tokens to execute transactions on blockchains, and considering governments and corporations are partnering with these blockchain developers who actually provide a service, investors see value in buying up other cryptocurrencies.

Unlike bitcoin, blockchain as a service that is directly applicable to our everyday lives is unlikely to simply collapse, especially considering its adoption by big players who clearly see a future for the technology.

Investing in cryptocurrencies that form part of a service ecosystem, rather than solely offering ethereal tokens that have no real, fundamental value, could prove to be the new stocks and shares, as blockchains move from being perceived as “just a fad” to a mainstream technology we all rely on in our day-to-day lives.

Among crypto assets with over $1 billion in invested value, Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency may have been the biggest disappointment to newer investors, declining sharply amid heightened scrutiny after a period in which it became an industry darling for new investors.

Still, XRP was far from alone in its sizable declines.

Bitcoin forks saw a similar sell-off, with bitcoin cash (BCH), which forked from the network in August, and bitcoin gold, which quickly followed, falling sharply amid a broad market decline.

XRP

January performance: -49.56 percent

$2.39 Price on Jan. 31: $1.16

$1.16 Rank as per market capitalization: 3

Entering January, it’s safe to say investors were high on XRP.

A key product for one of the most well-known industry startups, the digital asset won no shortage of favor from investors enamored by its goal of disrupting an oligopolistic global payments industry.

And the company provided fresh reasons for the interest. By the time XRP had become the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, three of the top five money transfer companies worldwide were said to be in the process of implementing XRP in their payment flow systems.

However, as the month progressed, the optimism failed to keep XRP bid.

A rumored listing on Coinbase never happened, and this, coupled with a broader market weakness weighed heavily over XRP. As of now, XRP is changing hands at $0.89 – a figure that’s down almost 80 percent from its record high.

Bitcoin cash

January performance: -41.29 percent

$2,432.54 Price on Jan. 31: $1,486.89

$1,486.89 Rank as per market capitalization: 4

Bitcoin cash (BCH), a fork of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, soared in the fourth quarter of 2017, as investors took note of the faster transaction speed and low fees.

Not only that, its surprise listing on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange in December boosted its appeal, while cryptocurrency exchange CoinEx implemented bitcoin cash as its default currency in January.

Still, it wasn’t all green for BCH, as it dropped 41.29 percent last month, possibly due to fears of stricter regulations in South Korea and China, the latter region being one from which it draws the majority of its support.

As of writing, BCH is trading at $1,169, down around 72 percent from its all-time high.

Bitcoin gold

January performance: -40.02 percent

Created via a fork of bitcoin in mid-November, bitcoin gold (BTG) surged to record highs in 2017.

Still, despite the temporary highs, in its initial days, it was perhaps the most unloved of bitcoin’s many forks. Back then, the investor community felt BTG was overvalued with few (or no) apparent use cases.

Entering January, it seems that sentiment won out, as BTG was one of the worst performers in January amid broad market sell-off.

As of writing, BTG is trading at $108, down 78 percent from lifetime high.

Deflated ball image via Shutterstock",2018-02-03 12:40:32+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/rich-and-paranoid-threats-prompt-radical-security-in-bitcoinland,"“Grumpynitis,” as he’s known on Reddit, figured he had taken every precaution he needed to protect his crypto assets.

After all, he worked as a security consultant to banks, governments and multinationals. He knew how to thwart hackers.

Then he read about the armed robbery.

And the kidnapping. And the swatting.

And he grew, in his words, “quite paranoid,” as he continued to perform his day job and realized the magnitude of the new threats the community was facing.

“It makes you think about what could happen one day,” Grumpy told CoinDesk in an email. Shaken, he started taking measures he previously didn’t think necessary.

This should set off alarm bells for non-experts. As cryptocurrency values have climbed, many users have suddenly become very wealthy – and consequently turned into prospective targets for offline criminals as much as online ones.

A number of investors are on high alert and trying to keep low profiles, realizing that not only their money may be at risk, but also their personal safety.

Like Grumpy (who, for obvious reasons, did not want to give his real name or other identifying details), they’re taking extra steps to protect their coins – and themselves.

But there’s growing concern that not enough users are being so cautious in light of the heightened hazards.

“People, time to change the dialogue,” cryptographer Ian Grigg recently tweeted, adding:

“Never ever ask someone how much crypto they have, or what crypto they have. Lives are now in danger.”

Illustrating the perils facing market participants, in December, Pavel Lerner, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Exmo Finance, was released from the custody of kidnappers after a $1 million bitcoin ransom was paid.

This followed an incident last fall in which New York authorities reported the armed robbery of someone in possession of $1.8 million-worth of ether.

And while it was probably motivated by malice more than greed, a swatting attack on BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp by “angry crypto fans” highlighted how security concerns have spilled over from cyberspace into meatspace. A battalion of local law enforcement cordoned off Lopp’s North Carolina neighborhood in response to a false report of hostage incident.

It’s against that backdrop that users like Grumpy are adjusting their threat models.

A thorough inspection

Previously, Grumpy stored the private keys to his cryptocurrency using an ingenious strategy of embedding an encrypted vault in a video file.

But he’s switched to the Ledger Nano S, a pocket-sized hardware wallet.

“Storing the private keys in a vault is good for cold storage, but when you want to use the wallet, you’ll have to expose your key to your PC,” Grumpy said.

A device like the Ledger, on the other hand, keeps the keys unexposed even when plugged into a computer that’s connected to the internet. Instead, the hardware wallet sends a signed message.

Still, Grumpy wasn’t taking any chances. After receiving the Ledger in the mail, Grumpy took the thing apart to verify the chips. He also double-checked the signatures that are generated by the device.

“This to be 99.99 percent sure that the device itself is genuine and that it hasn’t been tampered with,” he said.

This level of care underscores the added level of personal responsibility the crypto world now faces in a new security environment.

“It’s like moving from an apartment where building security is already provided, to a private home where you are responsible for your own security,” William Mougayar, the author and investor, told CoinDesk.

Most consumers, he said, have yet to make the mental jump to this new reality, which requires not only new skills and know-how but, critically, self-discipline.

“An eight-letter password in your head is no longer sufficient,” Mougayar said.

Multi-factor authentication, multi-signature arrangements, paper wallets (best kept in a safe), hardware devices like the Ledger, PIN codes and recovery phrases are now all baseline measures.

Yet, much of this is too complicated for the average consumer, Mougayar said.

“It is my hope that we will see more user-friendly ways to manage security and privacy in this new crypto-world,” he said. “Security usability is an industry challenge, that, once improved, will help to increase adoption by orders of magnitude. Security and usability can, and should be able to coexist.”

But beyond all these measures, users will have to learn the importance of discretion.

Asked why someone would ever admit how much crypto they own, Grigg tweeted in response that, “people in the bitcoin world are still too proud to realize that answering is a bad idea.”

Spreading the seeds

After inspecting his Ledger, Grumpy generated a seed phrase, or backup recovery text, on the ledger.

This phrase itself would have never seen a PC, he noted. The seed was 24 words, and he divided them over 3 pieces of paper. Each piece of paper contained 16 words.

Grumpy stored the three papers in safe places outside his home in tamper-evident envelopes (he recommends Tyveks) that are stored securely. Any two of these three papers can be used to reconstruct the seed. A few people know about these and know where they are stored, he said.

“Since one paper is worthless, I don’t have to worry about theft,” he said.

All this may make the Ledger sound like a high-maintenance device, but it’s been a hot seller of late.

Eric Larcheveque, CEO of Ledger, said his company had seen a 300-times year-on-year uptick in sales, thanks to the massive growth of the cryptocurrency market. The French company’s Nano S hardware wallet devices have proved the most popular, with about 1 million sold in 2017.

“With the increase of advanced exploits on general computing devices and secure enclaves (Meltdown, Spectre, Rowhammer, Clkscrew) the need for hardware wallets and external security devices that can be fully validated by the user has been more and more important and will continue to grow in 2018,” he predicted.

‘Rubber hose’ attacks

Much like Grumpy was shocked out of complacency by the grisly news reports, Lopp said his eyes were opened by the swatting attack on his home, as well as the armed robbery in which the victim was lured into a van and held at gunpoint.

Lopp calls the latter incident a “rubber hose” attack. Though they may not involve actually being beaten with one, the effect is the same.

While he has been a constant target online since rising to prominence several years ago as a passionate voice in the crypto community, “bringing it into the physical world made me realize that I’m at a new level where I have to worry about the random crackpot threatening me in real life,” Lopp told CoinDesk.

The engineer said he has now “reviewed some of his physical security practices and invested some time and resources in a few changes that will give me even more peace of mind.”

He declined to specify what those other changes were, but suggested anyone interested in beefing up their personal security read up on home defense.

If you get taken hostage, Lopp said, the only way to make it out without losing money is to not have direct access to your funds. In a post on Medium in 2014, Lopp suggested that at the level of investment-tier asset holdings, you’d want to have cold storage that requires multiple individuals to access. He recommended paper wallets with split keys via Shamir’s Secret Sharing algorithm or storage of assets in multi-signature addresses.

Lopp made for an ironic target – as he tells CoinDesk, he already had “pretty good physical security practices.”

“Over the years I’ve educated myself in hand-to-hand, knife and firearm combat,” he said, adding that he’s received tactical training from a variety of experts and has applied “a great number of best practices to my home to fortify it against various types of intrusions.”

“These things aren’t specific to the crypto space; physical security is a well-understood problem that any prominent people have to worry about,” he said.

But he said that a select number of even higher profile individuals could even someday be forced to hire bodyguards for true peace of mind.

Grumpynitis isn’t going that far – but he is thinking ahead.

If one of the envelopes holding the three pieces of paper gets damaged or stolen, he said, it should give him enough time to transfer the funds. But if he dies, trustworthy acquaintances can reconstruct the seed to recover the funds.

If he loses the funds one day and the secured envelopes are still intact, he won’t have to blame the persons he gave an envelope to.

He concluded:

“If something happens to the seed and one envelope has been opened, you know where it went wrong.”

""This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change my life.""

Knight and others visiting Melin were pinning their hopes on a new form of currency whose potential value the world was only beginning to recognize. Millions of people around the world are chasing after fortune by investing in bitcoin — which has soared by more than 2,500 percent in value in the past two years — and other digital instruments known as cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin and its rival currencies were not originally intended as a way to make money, only as a new and technologically savvy way to buy and sell goods and services outside the normal system of cash and credit cards. But bitcoin has been transformed into something else, a way to strike it rich for some, and for others, a hedge against a deeper anxiety about financial security and the economic future. For many, investing in bitcoin is a bit of both.

Created nearly 10 years ago by a pseudonymous computer programmer, bitcoin is unlike other kinds of money: It takes no physical form and is not issued by a government. Instead, bitcoin can be purchased on online exchanges, using checking accounts and credit cards. A publicly visible ledger called a blockchain records transactions. As a result, no one person runs the bitcoin network. It is collective and outside government control.

In Louisville, for those who believe in bitcoin, Melin, 22, is one of the most important guides. ""A visionary,"" Knight called him. ""Not afraid to step into the unknown.""

Three years earlier, Melin had been attending Indiana University Southeast, commuting from his mother's house. He could not shake the feeling that he was paying for something that was not worthwhile. He was learning more from economics podcasts than he was from his classes.

So he dropped out and pulled the remaining $22,000 from an education fund his mother had set up for him. He invested in cryptocurrency. For a while, he was a college dropout working at a casino buffet, driving a $500 car and sleeping on a living room floor. But in 2017, he made $770,000, money he used to buy a three-bedroom house, a pickup truck and a cat.

Melin was not necessarily looking to strike it rich. He was looking, he said, for an alternative to the global economic system. He had started to become suspicious of that system during the 2008 financial crisis, when his mother lost her job as a computer programmer. Even as the United States pulled out of the depths, Melin saw signs that the world had not learned its lessons. He read about countries such as China over-borrowing and overspending, ""building cities the size of Louisville that are empty."" He read about the growing U.S. deficit and felt that politicians could not solve the problem. He was especially bothered by the growing burden of baby boomers on Social Security programs.

""I almost blame the older generation,"" he said. ""I see these unsustainable programs. I'm going to be these people's slaves for the rest of my life.""

For him, bitcoin, a currency backed by no government, was a way to shield himself from those risks. He started by buying five bitcoin, at $400 each, and then roughly two dozen more, as the price reached toward $1,000. The people who worked with him at the Horseshoe Casino were more interested in buying lottery tickets, he said, than in listening to his investment advice.

""Everybody thought I was crazy,"" Melin said.

Then, that started to change. The price of a bitcoin in 2017 shot up to $2,000, and then $5,000, and then $10,000, and then, briefly, nearly $20,000. Cable networks started giving cryptocurrency nearly the same attention they give the stock market. In Louisville, Internet-organized meetups that once attracted a half-dozen people filled up with 40 or 50.

In August, Melin joined a cryptocurrency consulting business, started by another early investor, Enrique Rodriquez, with the aim of guiding newcomers — holding workshops for them, teaching them the technology, helping them to avoid frauds and pitfalls. Since then, they have met the new generation of cryptocurrency buyers: retirees, the unemployed, factory workers, teachers.

""People have this perception of bitcoin as fast money,"" Melin said. ""Because it was.""

As bitcoin and its many competitors are hitting the mainstream, a once-lucrative market is turning instead into perhaps the world's most volatile — what some economists call a speculative bubble in line with the dot-com craze of the late 1990s. Investors are bidding up prices of bitcoin and its many smaller competitors and selling in a panic. Values of cryptocurrencies soar and plunge in a matter of hours, sometimes by more than 30 percent. Far away from Silicon Valley, the people riding the roller coaster swing between excitement and dread, all while gathering at local meetups, downloading apps to track their investments, and sharing tips on message boards and chat groups — one is called ""Cointucky.""

""Not looking good. It's falling scary fast,"" one investor wrote as another day began in the Louisville cryptocurrency chat group Melin and Rodriquez set up.

""Welp time to file bankruptcy,"" somebody said.

""Now we are bouncing!"" another wrote, hours later.

Then, at the end of the day: ""Here we go boys. Hang on tight.""

'It's a weight on me'

Knight, the software salesman, figured that cryptocurrency was worth a gamble because he saw no better way to rapidly improve his life. He enjoyed his job — his company ranked him as one of the top sales representatives in the region — but he was with his fourth employer in a decade, and the pay, about $90,000 per year, left him feeling stuck in place. He had a wife and two children. He was only slowly saving for retirement. Unlike his father, he did not have a pension.

AD

""Bitcoin is my potential pension,"" Knight said.

He also had a $600-per-month student loan payment, an obligation he figured he would still be paying off in 20 years. He had come to believe that Americans were too reliant on debt.

""They tell you to go to college, get your education, then you'll have a six-figure job,"" Knight said. ""I know so many people working at Starbucks with all this education. I was one of these people that was told, 'Go into debt, and then pay us for the rest of your life.' It's a major concern. It's a weight on me.""

After a friend mentioned crypto­currency on Facebook, and after talking with members of his gym and meeting with Rodriquez at a coffee shop in December, Knight decided to dive in. Right after Christmas, he bought $300 in cryptocurrency. Then $250. Then $100.

He tried to gather spare money whenever he could and cut down on meals at restaurants, instead packing couscous for his lunches. He reminded himself of how his life might look in five years. ""I could be writing a check to pay my house off,"" he said. ""That's the excitement I have.""

""It's new territory,"" Knight added. ""So many unknowns.""

Trying to predict the future of bitcoin has only grown more complicated in recent months, because digital currencies are being launched almost daily. They have names such as litecoin, steem and EOS, and for Knight, it was these that were the most attractive. As he began investing, he noticed one particular currency surging: mintcoin, which cost about a tenth of a penny. On Jan. 7, he bought 25,000 mintcoin as the value was starting to soar.

AD

Then he tried to ride the wave. The day was just starting, and Knight kept refreshing his phone, charting his progress. The currency's value climbed a bit more. A few hours passed. He had made $268. He told his wife. He watched YouTube videos about other currencies. And then, just before he went to bed, he noticed the value of mintcoin start to tumble. It was down 15 percent. It was down 30 percent. ""The anxiety,"" Knight said, shaking his head.

AD

Finally in the morning, when his profit was wiped out, he sold his 25,000 mintcoin, recouping only the money he had put in. He told himself he had made a mistake.

By mid-January, he had invested a total of $1,500 in cryptocurrencies and seen the value dwindle by about $100. He texted Melin a cartoon — a dejected man holding his head in his hands. The caption read: ""When you bought a crypto coin an hour ago and it still isn't up 1000%.""

Gaining, losing and hoping

The day after receiving that text, Melin woke up and looked at his phone. The cryptocurrency market was sliding again — but this time more sharply. Melin had lost more than $100,000 overnight. ""A bloodbath,"" he said.

When he arrived at his two-room office suite in the Louisville suburbs, the first meeting of the day was with Knight.

Knight had arrived to pitch the office on some software for small businesses, but after he was finished, he turned to Melin and said he thought he had been taking the wrong approach with his investing. Melin agreed; newcomers often tried to find a shortcut to a payday.

AD

""Yeah. I don't do day trading,"" Melin said.

Knight nodded.

""I got my butt burned,"" he said.

But then Melin tried to put it in perspective. Everything happening now — the ups and downs — were still minor compared with what might still come, he felt. The global economy was humming along; what if it fell into crisis? Cryptocurrency would boom as never before. This was still an early way to get in.

""What crypto allows is for the masses to be venture capitalists,"" Melin said.

""And guys like me, I'm not in the loop,"" Knight said. ""This is my chance.""

""My thinking, everybody should be in this to some extent,"" Melin said. ""You have it as an insurance against the traditional market.""

They parted ways and continued to watch the market. Melin met with two other new investors, one who said he was so excited by digital currency that he was barely sleeping. At 3:30 p.m., Melin checked his crypto account. He held $473,000 in currency. Twenty-five minutes later, he checked again: It was down to $445,000. At 4:47 p.m., he checked again. It was down to $428,000. Then $412,000. He walked into his company's other office, filled with a few part-time analysts he had hired. They were looking at charts, all pointing down. ""I'm sick of staring at screens and feeling sad,"" one of the analysts said.

Melin said these swings are part of the deal.

""It's a great time to buy,"" he said. ""Right now. A great time.""

Knight, meantime, went home, cooked dinner and then decided to reopen one of the eight cryptocurrency apps he had downloaded. His account had fallen nearly $500 on the day — his initial $1,500 was below $900 — and he said he was ""freaking out."" But then, he thought about what it meant to be a cryptocurrency investor. There would be days such as this. But there might be better days, too — much better days. If there were, he did not want to miss out.",2018-02-03,https://news.bitcoin.com/ledger-addresses-man-in-the-middle-attack-that-threatens-millions-of-hardware-wallets/,"Ledger Addresses Man in the Middle Attack That Threatens Millions of Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, which sold over one million devices last year, has alerted its users to a major attack vector that’s recently been discovered. Although there are no reported cases of the attack being successfully deployed, the threat itself is very real. Today, Ledger urged users of its cryptocurrency wallets to take steps to avoid falling prey to the address spoofing attack.

Beware the Man in the Middle

Hardware wallets are regarded as one of the safest means of storing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The USB cold storage devices eliminate the sort of attack vectors synonymous with being connected to the web. But to send funds or issue a receiving address, a hardware wallet has to be plugged in to an internet-enabled device, and researchers have discovered a vulnerability that affects Ledger devices at this stage. A newly published report reveals the way the MiTM attack would play out. It explains:

Ledger wallets generate the displayed receive address using JavaScript code running on the host machine…malware can simply replace the code responsible for generating the receive address with its own address, causing all future deposits to be sent to the attacker.

The attack, if executed, would leave the victim unaware at first that anything was the matter. To prove the the vulnerability is real, the report’s authors have posted a proof of concept that demonstrates the attack in action. The severity of the attack is heightened by the fact that, with Ledger’s wallet software stored in the AppData folder, it is relatively easy for malware to modify the receiving address. As the report notes, “All the malware needs to do is replace one line of code…this can be achieved with less than 10 lines of python”.

A Solution of Sorts

To avoid succumbing to this attack, there is a means of verifying the receiving address is correct, as the report explains, and as Ledger acknowledged in a tweet earlier today:

This solution, while effective, is not failsafe in that it’s reliant on the user remembering to follow this procedure every time they transact. As the report points out, “A proper solution would be to [force] the user to validate the receive address before every receive transaction, just like the wallet [forces] the user to approve every send transaction”.

That’s the system that Trezor now uses with its hardware wallets, mandating the use of 2FA simply to access the receiving address. It is hoped that Ledger will follow suit in updating its devices to adopt this methodology. Hardware wallets are still significantly safer than leaving funds stored on a centralized exchange, but no solution is entirely foolproof, as the Ledger case demonstrates.

UPDATE: Since this post was published, Ledger has reiterated that this “is an industry wide issue. All hardware wallets are affected: this is not a vulnerability of the device, but a reminder about the fact you cannot trust what you see on the screen of your computer.” It has also announced: “An updated Ledger Chrome application: We released an update…to the Chrome application that will force users to verify destination addresses on their Ledger hardware device – not just on the screen of their computer. This feature has been available for months – we will now make it even more visible. The Ledger Wallet desktop application will also be updated soon.”

Do you think this vulnerability is cause for concern and do you think Ledger should enforce 2FA to resolve it? Let us know in the comments section below.

This week one of Europe’s largest power companies, Enel, has announced the firm has absolutely “no interest whatsoever in selling power” to cryptocurrency miners.

One of Europe’s Largest Power Companies Allegedly Evaluated Cryptocurrency Mining Operations

The Italian multinational renewable-energy corporation located in Rome, Enel, made a statement on Thursday that explains it will not sell power to data centers who plan to mine cryptocurrencies. According to the financial publication Bloomberg the company was allegedly discussing a deal with a Switzerland-based cryptocurrency business called Envion AG. The news outlet stated that “according to people with direct knowledge of the matter” Enel was evaluating the market to sell power to bitcoin and other digital asset miners. Further, a company executive also commented on the mining evaluation story.

“Enel is particularly interested in understanding how the energy business can benefit from the blockchain technology,” the head of the firm’s front trading office, Leonardo Zannella said at the time.

Cryptocurrency miners who can move their facilities to places where electricity is cheap might have advantages.

Enel Changes Its Tune “No Interest Whatsoever In Selling Power” to Cryptocurrency Miners

However, subsequently after the alleged discussions, the power company changed its tune. Enel says it takes pride in providing “green power” deriving from biomass and incineration practices, geothermal resources, hydroelectricity, wind, and solar power. Moreover, the company believes that cryptocurrency mining cannot be maintained in an environmentally friendly way.

“Enel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development,” explains a spokesperson this past Thursday.

The intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing.

The news follows the swathes of Chinese miners looking for new residency in other areas around the world. Just recently Bitmain Technologies said it was looking for properties in Canada and also launched a subsidiary in Zug, Switzerland. Enel’s decision may be seen as a small obstacle as miners can utilize more friendlier power companies willing to sell cryptocurrency miners power. Although the firm has operations in sixteen countries across Europe, North America and South America. The company controls a majority of power operations in Spain as well.

What do you think about Enel saying they won’t sell power to cryptocurrency miners? Let us know in the comments below.

Bitcoin was up around 7 per cent in 24 hours.

Bitcoin rose to $8,997 on Saturday morning, according to CoinDesk data.

This latest rebound in price marks what appears to be an end to a severe sell-off, which saw a decrease of $100 billion in the cryptocurrency markets and sent bitcoin below $8,000 for the first time since November.

This comes amid tougher regulations on the cryptocurrency markets.

India's Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the country wants to ""eliminate"" the use of digital currencies in criminal activities.

Bitcoinist spoke to David Drake, Chairman of LDJ Capital, a $200 million dollar cryptocurrency fund, about the current price downtrend, what determines ICO quality, and the potential impact of regulations in key countries across the globe.

David Drake is the Chairman of LDJ Capital, who has also been involved in TMT (technology, media, telecoms), realty, hospitality, clean tech, energy, and social impact investments for more than 20 years.

Drake is an advocate of innovative investing in early-stage equity, capital formation policies and developments globally, and the US JOBS Act which he lobbied for in the US Congress and the EU Commission.

Because of his leading work in this space, he represented the US Commerce Department at the EU Commission in Brussels and Rome in 2012 and was invited to the White House Champions of Change ceremony in Washington, D.C. and as a speaker at the UK Parliament in 2013.

Bitcoinist: What is LDJ Capital? How much capital do you currently manage?

David Drake (DD): LDJ Cayman Fund Ltd is a $200M cryptocurrency fund across the whole Capital stack.

I am also a board advisor for several Initial Token Offerings. Top 15 ICOs I advise raised $500,000,000 in the last 6 months. Fortunately, I have 25 employees managing daily interactions with the 20 ICOs I help.

I certainly feel like a Lucky Golden Token.

LDJ Capital is a financially integrated family office with a global footprint and local presence in 12 countries. We raise interest from our family office resources and from our LDJ Capital team members, who include the likes of a former chairman of Nasdaq and CEO of Intel Capital. We are taking on a few more ICOs on a road trip in the next few months.

Bitcoinist: Is your fund involved in cryptocurrency trading?

DD: Yes, we’re involved in investing in crypto trading, as well as long-term investments but I’d say 80% of our trading you buy and hold as we are long-term players and looking in on the line of strong fundamentals.

After having underwritten and worked with 250 different funds we have finally learned how to understand and underwrite the best of the best. I made it 12 xx on quantstamp making millions.

Bitcoinist: What is your experience with Bitcoin/cryptocurrencies?

DD: My job is best performed as a global strategist and board advisor. In parallel 150 family offices, crypto traders and hedge funds globally rely on my opinion. Thus, I need your ICO quality to be institutional-grade.

Bitcoinist: What determines whether an ICO is “institutional-grade”?

DD: Equity capacity, revenue, existing business history, leadership, composition, regulatory framework, brand recognition.

Bitcoinist: What are your thoughts on crypto in 2018 so far? Typical January price correction across the board or something more serious?

DD: I think we will have Regulators stirring up the marketplace several times a week for the next two months until the SEC comes out with a direction and institutions are starting to invest.

At that point, prices will go off and I think that’s going to happen around March and April.

Bitcoinist: What kind of impact will Facebook no longer allowing crypto ads have on the industry? Is this a good thing (e.g. no more BitConnect ads) or will it have a negative impact?

DD: I think the industrial address will slow down the growth and the hype of the business, and that’s a good thing.

Bitcoinist: How about China banning ICO’s and clamping down on its mining industry? Is this the end of China being a dominant player in crypto?

DD: The Chinese moved their business to Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Chinese exporters are getting paid in foreign fiat so they’re still very big exporters of capitals as they export their product.

This is not the end of their play in the industry but they’re certainly not going to be a top three player at the end 2018.

Bitcoinist: Regulations are also looming in major crypto markets like South Korea and India, for example. What kind of regulatory approach should nations follow? The hardline Chinese or the accommodating Japanese model, for example?

DD: Absolutely Japanese, and that’s exactly what they will be doing by guiding, how to deal with cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings.

Bitcoinist: Bitcoin price has dropped over 50% since December, but most altcoins have dropped even more. Is diversifying in altcoins pointless? Should traders simply sit out in fiat during these types of downtrends?

DD: Traders certainly are cashing out and they’re sitting and waiting for the correction; and, we see this happening every 2 to 3 weeks constantly.

They are making money on our fear.

Bitcoinist: Besides Bitcoin, what cryptocurrencies would you recommend to your clients?

DD: The contenders against Ether such as EOS and Stellar. They are upcoming contenders for the top three spots and I am very eager to see how quickly they will grow and today its half-price Friday.

Bitcoinist: Where do you see the crypto industry in 2-5 years? Is crypto here to stay? Will traditional traders keep flocking to crypto?

DD: It’s here to stay and it’s a permanent force that’s going to be a 10 trillion dollar market.

Bitcoinist: So what can investors do in the meantime?

DD: It’s half-price, so go shopping.

He says he invested $34,000 and turned it into low seven figures in six months.

The 24-year-old says he quit his job last fall and now travels the world as a startup adviser and angel investor.



Last summer Kingsley Advani said he sold his worldly possessions — namely his laptop and headphones — and emptied thousands of dollars from his bank account.

After seeing the once-in-a-lifetime returns that bitcoin has brought, he wanted in. Advani said he invested $34,000 in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and startups working on related technologies, and he watched his net worth balloon to low seven figures in six months.

At an age when many people are trying to climb up the career ladder, Advani works as an adviser to cryptocurrency startups with a salary of zero. He travels between London, New York, and San Francisco, taking meetings and scouting startups working on what may be the next great blockchain technology.

""I think at no point in human history have people in their 20s had such an opportunity to invest in such high-growth assets,"" Advani told Business Insider.

Created in 2008, bitcoin is a payment system that allows people to buy things and send money without attaching their names to transactions. There are no banks or middlemen. Transactions are recorded on a digital ledger called a blockchain.

It was the blockchain that first excited Advani about cryptocurrencies, he said.

In 2012 a friend introduced Advani to bitcoin, which at the time was largely used for buying and selling illegal drugs online. Advani saw the full potential of the technology.

""It's like a rebellion to traditional finance,"" Advani said. He believes its creation in 2008 — at the height of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression — was no coincidence. ""You don't need centralized banks to send money — you have these great pieces of tech send money for you through cryptography. So unlike banks, it's faster, cheaper, and more secure.""

Advani started reading white papers on cryptocurrencies and watching the market more closely last summer. He decided he would not miss a second chance to take part. He invested all his savings and part of his income from his job as a data scientist at a small software company.

""Every month I was waiting for that paycheck and I put it straight in,"" Advani said.

According to Advani, most of his wealth comes from his early-stage investments in startups spun out of top universities, like Stanford, Cornell, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They are mostly working on high-speed blockchains, the technology at the heart of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At its peak, Advani's net worth rose to low seven figures, though it fluctuates with the swing of the market, he said.

He quit his software job in October and now travels the world as an adviser and angel investor.

The 24-year-old is currently crashing on a bunk bed in a San Francisco hacker house for young cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and plans to move to the city full time.

Advani said he doesn't drink or party; instead, he spends most of his free time meditating and reading cryptocurrency research online. During our interview, he whipped out his phone to share data from Headspace, a meditation app. He hasn't missed a session in over 400 days.

""I've decided to optimize time in front of the computer, because it's so easy to get distracted. I order all my food online to the door. I don't spend any time grocery shopping because I think it's a waste of time,"" Advani said. He added, ""I try to live in a 'bunker' as much as possible.""

Advani believes the key to his success has been limiting the number of things he focuses on. He doesn't read every news story on the value of bitcoin or pay close attention to its rise and fall.

Instead, Advani said he reads the latest research on the underlying technology and possibilities of cryptocurrencies and tries to map where they're headed. He doesn't recommend investing in cryptocurrencies for everyone — unless they're willing to dig into the white papers like he has.

""Only put in what you can afford to lose,"" Advani said.

Several Central Asian countries have taken steps to embrace cryptos one way or another. Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan are some of the less conspicuous former Soviet republics, but now they are starting to appear on the crypto radar. With certain inherent advantages and some clever new policies, they try to attract investors and integrate into the global cryptocurrency ecosphere.

Cryptos Spent for the Common Good

Kyrgyzstan, which borders some of China’s mining regions, wants to use cryptos in public contracts. Prime Minister Sapar Isakov made the announcement during an economic forum in Almaty, the financial capital of neighboring Kazakhstan. “The digital agenda in the era of globalization” gathered government officials from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), Sputnik reported.

According to Mr. Isakov, Kyrgyzstan will introduce crypto payments in projects financed by the government, as part of a program that should bring digital transformation to the country. “Taza Koom” is intended to build an open and transparent state, increase living standards and improve business environment. Through its implementation the country intends to take advantage of “emerging technological goods and services”.

Kyrgyzstani authorities plan to spend cryptos on an array of projects – from a program to improve access to government services, to a campaign to install traffic cameras for safer roads. They claim the goal is to build a “tidy and transparent society” and the Premier says:

Using cryptocurrencies will reduce corruption. We’ll be able to optimize government spending and increase budget receipts. We want to be a digital society!

Global, Democratic, and Transparent

Kazakhstan, where Isakov arrived on a working visit, also wants to be part of the crypto progress. The president of the Central Asian republic Nursultan Nazarbaev said he was interested in launching “a cryptocurrency, which is global in nature”. It will be called G-Global and will be “democratic and transparent”. The coin will be backed by assets, not just trust, he added, quoted by Bitsmedia. Those were not specified, although Kazakhstan is rich with natural resources. At the 10th Astana International Forum Nazarbaev also said:

G-Global will be a good step to free the world of monetary wars and black marketing. It will also reduce volatility.

Actively involved in the development of the new crypto is the G-Global Business Portal – a platform that unites experts from around the world working to digitize enterprises in the real sector.

Cheap Mining Also Offered

Another country from the Central Asian neighborhood, Uzbekistan, placed third in a recent study of cryptocurrency mining expenses. According to the International Business Times, it costs $1,790 to mine a single bitcoin there. Venezuela ($531) and Trinidad and Tobago ($1,190) are leading the chart. Kazakhstan is not too far behind with $2,835 per bitcoin (Kyrgyzstan was not included in the survey).

Data about the electricity rates was collected from government sources, utility companies and the International Energy Agency. The average power consumption from three mining rigs – Antminer S7, Antminer S9, and Avalon 6 – was taken into account.

In general, countries in Asia and Eastern Europe offer the cheapest crypto mining. Generating 1 BTC in Ukraine should cost $1,852, and in Belarus – $2,177. It turns out that mining in China is more expensive – $3,172, India is very close with $3,274, and in Russia miners have to spend $4,675 USD per coin on average.

The cryptocurrency surged from below $1,000 at the beginning of the year to a peak of $19,000 in early December, and drew the attention of everyone from Warren Buffett to Jamie Foxx.

In recent days, cryptocurrencies turned heads for a different reason. More than $100 billion in value was lost in the global cryptocurrency market Friday, as the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies in circulation plummeted by $112.6 billion to $405 billion Friday morning, according to CoinMarketCap.com.

The volatile asset has also recently caught the attention of some of the nation's most prominent athletes, according to NFL star Richard Sherman, a cornerback for the Seattle Seahawks.

""Especially the way bitcoin boomed from nothing to ... $19,000 at one point, that really caught the eye of a lot of people,"" Sherman tells CNBC Make It. ""Ever since then it has been common conversation for a lot of us.""

Sherman, who began accepting bitcoin for merchandise on his website as early as 2014, is currently recovering from an injury to his Achilles tendon, and is using his time off to study cryptocurrency. He's also a spokesperson for the exchange platform Cobinhood, and an investor in the company's coin, COB.

Sherman also owns bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum.

""There are a ton of different coins,"" Sherman says, and his NFL buddies are ""trying to figure out which one is the one they should get.""

But Sherman doesn't give investing advice. ""Who knows,"" he says. ""You read up, you hear great things about some, you hear terrible things about others, they fluctuate throughout the day. It is such an unpredictable market.""

Often, Sherman hears the most simple questions from other football players, like ""Are there physical coins?"" he says. Team mates will ask, ""What is the difference between this and a stock? Or this and a bond?""

""A lot of them have just been trying their best to become more educated on not only cryptocurrencies, but just stocks and trading in general. Because a lot of them have been taken advantage of by financial advisers,"" Sherman explains. ""So people in my sport, in my field, are definitely becoming more educated and trying to be more intelligent with how they play for the money and understanding where their money is going.""

Although players often earn millions, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2015 found that roughly one in six players in the NFL files for bankruptcy within 12 years of retiring from their career. But Sherman sees progress happening.

""The NFL has done a great job of opening its doors,"" he says, inviting financial experts to speak with players, and partnering with business schools to offer classes. ""That is how a lot of players are getting their information and becoming educated on the subject of money management.

""None of us really grew up with ... financial literacy,"" Sherman adds.

For now, he and his teammates are curious about cryptocurrency.

""It is difficult to try to advise anyone, but we definitely have a ton of conversations about it,"" Sherman says.

Ddermedgoglou is using an MSI GP62M 7RDX Leopard, a fairly recent machine with a 7th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU, a GTX 1050 GPU with either 2GB or 4GB of VRAM (depending on how it was configured), and up to 32GB of RAM.

In theory, it's the GPU that matters most for cryptocurrency mining. But depending on what our reader is planning on mining, even the GPU might not matter.

Bitcoin, they already know, is out. Even the most high-end GPUs aren't powerful enough to mine Bitcoin anymore, and most users need dedicated hardware called application-specific integrated circuit chips, or ASICs, that are designed exclusively for mining.

So that leaves smaller coins like Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero or a bunch of cryptocurrencies so small that you'd have to do research just to find them. You can still use a high-end GPU for mining those currencies, though ddermedgoglou's GTX 1050 won't cut it. Crypto miners are buying up high-end cards like the GTX 1060, 1070 and 1080 in bulk, but the 1050 just isn't as popular, because it's far less powerful (on the desktop side, it's one of the few cards whose prices aren't skyrocketing). That doesn't mean mining impossible, but it will take a lot longer.

MORE: Which GPU is Right For You

Even if you have a more powerful GPU in your laptop, there are other considerations. One is heat. Laptops are far smaller spaces than desktops, and constantly running a laptop's most powerful parts, especially mining for hours on end, could be damaging in the long run. That's even if you use something like MSI's Cooler Booster to blast the fans.

Then there's the question of electricity. If you're mining a cryptocurrency, you're probably hoping to make some money off of it. While many analysts have suggested that cryptocurrency — especially Bitcoin — is too unstable to use as everyday currency, many still look at it as a speculative investment, like gold.

But here's the thing: Electricity isn't free. And if you're mining a cryptocurrency, you'll need your laptop plugged in for long hours and working its most energy-sucking components at their hardest. Will your electric bill cost more than anything you've mined? If so, you may end up in the red.

So, can you mine cryptocurrency from your laptop? Maybe. It may take a long time, and it may ultimately damage your laptop, but it's possible, depending on the coin. However, your laptop really isn't the right tool, and you may end up burning it out or paying more to mine than you're getting out of it.

Angst.

Banken moeten over het algemeen niks van cryptocurrency hebben. Althans, niet zoals de zaken nu zijn. Mocht er ooit een regulatie komen, dan is het een ander verhaal. En er zijn natuurlijk uitzonderingen, kijk bijvoorbeeld naar een munt als Ripple.

De Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase en Citigroup hebben echter een muur opgezet om aanschaf van cryptocurrency te voorkomen. Klanten van deze banken kunnen met hun creditcard geen Bitcoins, Ethereum of andere crypto aanschaffen. Zodra een gebruiker crypto probeert te kopen, grijpt de creditcard in en zal de betaling worden geweigerd.

De banken zeggen de klanten te willen beschermen en ergens zit daar ook een kern van waarheid in. In de Verenigde Staten zijn er genoeg mensen die smijten met de creditcard, zonder na te denken over eventuele schulden of het feit dat ze aankoop eigenlijk niet kunnen betalen. Met cryptocurrency is dat, gezien de fluctualiteit, erg gevaarlijk. Mensen kunnen gokgedrag gaan vertonen, zeker als het rookies zijn die net instappen in de wereld van crypto.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged on Monday.

Bitcoin was down 15% for the day, while ethereum was down a whopping 20%, according to Coindesk.

The cryptocurrency plunge was happening as the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points on Monday, after closing down 666 points on Friday.

The trouble started brewing in December. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI started to crack down on alleged fraud in fundraising by some cryptocurrency companies and traders.

Digital currency had been operating in a regulatory vacuum since bitcoin's debut in 2009. But regulators started paying closer attention and warned investors about potential scams. The SEC created a Cyber Unit to go after suspected fraudsters.

Garrick Hileman, a cryptocurrency researcher at the University of Cambridge, said some big banks also recently pushed back on digital currencies, which are not issued by any government, unlike traditional currencies.

""The recent spate of bad news continues for cryptocurrencies, with several important banks announcing a ban on the purchase of cryptocurrencies with credit cards,"" he said.

In Asia, where cryptocurrency is particularly popular, China and South Korea have both cracked down on cryptocurrency trading.

Concerns about new restrictions, and rumors over a potential ban in India, have fueled volatility in crypto prices.

Bitcoin is the best known of virtual currencies and experienced a wild run-up in value last year to nearly $20,000 before plunging in December.

Hileman said the dramatic increase last year could also be contributing to the pullback in other cryptocurrencies like ethereum, which didn't experience the same level of volatility prior to the current comedown.

Largest British Banking Group Banning Crypto

Britain’s largest banking group with 30 million customers, Lloyds Banking Group, said on Sunday that it will ban its credit card customers from buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Reuters reported.

Lloyds Banking Group operates the UK’s largest retail bank, Lloyds Bank, as well as other well-known brands: Bank of Scotland, Halifax, MBNA, Black Horse, LDC, AMC, Colleys, Scottish Widows, Lex Autolease, and Birmingham Midshires.

The group has “9 million credit card customers that it will block any attempts to buy bitcoin after the digital currency lost more than half its value in just two months,” the Telegraph reported, noting that debit cards are unaffected and customers can continue to buy cryptocurrencies using them. Citing that Lloyds has a quarter of the UK credit card market, the news outlet elaborated:

From Monday credit card customers of Lloyds, which includes Halifax, Bank of Scotland and MBNA, will be blocked from buying the cryptocurrency online via a blacklist which will flag up sellers.

A spokeswoman for Lloyds confirmed to Reuters in an email that ”Across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, we do not accept credit card transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrencies.”

Fear of Huge Losses

Lloyds’ decision was made to “protect customers” from making unaffordable losses on bitcoin, the company’s spokesman was quoted by the Telegraph. According to a finance lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, Gavin Brown, “For some people, the only way to finance this level of speculation is through credit, with people just doing it to make a gain.”

The company’s announcement came “amid fears they [credit card customers] could run up huge losses,” the publication conveyed, adding that:

The bank fears it could end up footing the bill for unpaid debt should the price fall any lower.

In addition, “Concerns are also growing that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used for drug dealing and money laundering,” the publication expressed, adding that “It is thought that other banks will shortly follow suit.”

A Global Epidemic

Several US banks have also announced a ban on cryptocurrency credit card payments. On Friday, Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Citigroup said that they would block attempts to buy cryptocurrencies using credit cards.

“At this time, we are not processing cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards, due to the volatility and risk involved,” a JP Morgan Chase spokesperson told CNBC. Similarly, Citigroup said in a statement that it has “made the decision to no longer permit credit card purchases of cryptocurrency.”

“Bank of America started declining credit card transactions with known crypto exchanges on Friday,” according to Bloomberg, adding that the policy applies to all personal and business credit cards but does not apply to debit cards.

In South Korea, card companies are also voluntarily blocking transactions to overseas cryptocurrency exchanges. According to Business Korea, “Card companies have adopted the system in line with the government’s efforts to tackle speculative investment in virtual currencies.”

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining has become a growing industry, and mining operations continue to compete by making faster chips and purchasing large quantities of land to host data facilities all over the world. Data recorded from around the globe shows the mining economy is booming and the venture has become very profitable for many mining operations and chip manufacturers. For instance, this week it was revealed by regional reports that the Chinese firm, Bitmain Technologies, raked in 14.3 billion yuan ($2.3billion USD) in revenue last year from sales.

Mining Proves to Be One of Cryptocurrency’s Most Profitable Sectors

Mining cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has become very profitable for those who know how to obtain cheap electricity and operate a sound business. The ecosystem has spread as Graphics processing unit (GPU), and Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip manufacturers are making lots of money from the mining industry.

Public shares from companies like AMD, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), and many others have spiked considerably this past year. It turns out, that still to this day, churning out complicated math problems to find blocks is one of the hottest sectors in the cryptocurrency space, and this phenomenon will likely continue. One example is the 16-nanometer mining chip that has been an industry standard for quite some time, but now 12nm, 10nm, and 7nm chips are coming in the near future.

China’s Two Dominant Mining Manufacturing Businesses

One firm, Bitmain Technologies, has been a top mining chip manufacturer for a very long time delivering mass-produced ASIC rigs featuring 28nm, 16nm semiconductors. A recent disclosure from China’s Digitimes details that Bitmain had reportedly ordered 100,000 12nm chips from TSMC and the order was marked “urgent.” Alongside the order, according to the publications 8BTC and Applancer, the Chinese mining firm Bitmain Technologies revenue in 2017 was 14.3 billion yuan ($2.3billion USD). The report says that “Bitmain has become China’s second largest IC design company, ranked only second to Hisilicon.” With many companies entering the industry, Bitmain is relentlessly holding its top position in the cryptocurrency mining economy.

Another company that’s done very well last year is China’s Canaan Creative a firm that also creates digital currency miners. The Avalon bitcoin mining chip manufacturer attracted investors in May of last year raising 300m yuan ($43Mn USD). A week later Canaan acquired the first document timestamping service for the bitcoin core blockchain called Proof of Existence. According to the reports, Canaan has been developing 7nm semiconductor chip designs and has plans to enter the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market. Coincidently Bitmain is also attempting to enter the AI market with its custom-designed semiconductor hardware.

Bitfury Is Still Dabbling In the Mining Industry

The blockchain firm Bitfury created in 2011 has said it has been making a lot of money this year as the company claims to be generating $100Mn USD annually. Although, it’s also been reported that the company doesn’t like to be referred to as a ‘mining company’ anymore, but still seems to dabble in the industry.

Nevertheless, the company still has a mining pool, but it doesn’t command the hashrate it used to years ago, capturing only 1.7 percent of the network’s processing power. Further, the company’s website sells a mobile bitcoin mining unit called the ‘Blockbox,’ and it still sells custom 16nm semiconductor chips. The company hasn’t shown any signs of designing a new semiconductor smaller than the 16nm. Bitfury has also pivoted its business in many different directions with ideas like lightbulbs that mine bitcoin, and blockchain surveillance services. At the same time, the firm has recently claimed to be building the biggest mining operation in North America.

New Fish or Sharks Will Swim Among the Whales

All of these current mining conglomerates have some competition coming soon as there are a few companies aiming to join the mining industry with superior technology. For instance, the Japanese firm, GMO Internet Inc, just recently announced the successful completion of 12nm Fin FET Compact (FFC) semiconductor chips. After completing this task, GMO says the feat has brought them closer “towards realizing a […] 7 NM process technology for mining chips.”

Another Japanese firm that is making waves in the mining industry is the e-commerce and internet conglomerate DMM Group. The firm has started its own mining operations and a “crypto mining lab” that plans to research and develop “the highest per unit hash power” in custom DMM machines.

According to reports last week, the well known Korean electronics manufacturer Samsung is entering the bitcoin hardware and semiconductor market. Allegedly Samsung’s foundry is manufacturing 10-nanometer chips for both GPU and ASIC devices.

It’s safe to say the mining industry will continue to be a very lucrative business, but there have been many failed operations along the way like Butterfly Labs, Black Arrow Software, Hashfast, Vmc, and Cointerra. Some of the older companies like Canaan and Bitmain still have to keep their guard up as new entrants come into the market with faster processors. However, the revenues and funding these existing companies received this year continues to give them a competitive edge until the newcomers prove their devices and semiconductors are what they claim.

What do you think about the competitive mining industry and how lucrative these businesses are? Do you think the new companies claiming to have faster chips will change the mining industry? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

By mid-afternoon, it was approaching $7,000 per coin.

After having a rough time last week, the cryptocurrency market remains under pressure.

Last week's sell-off was driven by an investigation into tether, a cryptocurrency that some fear has been used to inflate the value of bitcoin.



LONDON — The price of bitcoin dropped back below $8,000 a coin and closed in on the $7,000 on Monday amid persisting high volatility in the cryptocurrency markets.

Bitcoin initially dropped below $8,000 on Friday during a wild day of trading that saw the cryptocurrency drop by as much as 15%, to a low of $7,700, before jumping and eventually ending the day in positive territory, close to $9,000.

After a reasonably stable weekend of trading, bitcoin's slump resumed Monday, falling as much as 12% during afternoon trade.

As of 3.30 p.m. GMT (10.30 a.m. ET), bitcoin was approaching $7,000 per coin, trading at $7,297, a drop of 11% from its opening price, as the chart below illustrates:

The crypto market has been on the back foot since the start of the year, hit by fears of a regulatory crackdown and slipping Asian volumes. Bitcoin is now at less than half its December peak of over $19,000.

Monday's drop comes amid announcements from numerous major banks prohibiting the use of their credit cards to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In the US, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup have announced bans, while Lloyds Banking Group is expected to do the same in the UK on Monday.

Confidence has also been dented after reports that China is planning a ban on websites related to ICOs and other forms of cryptocurrency trading.

""To prevent financial risks, China will step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs,"" an article in Financial News, a publication affiliated to the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said, according to a report in the South China Morning Post.",2018-02-05 00:00:00.000,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16976114/tmobile-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-hack-security-breach-lawsuit,"A man sued T-Mobile on Sunday, claiming that the company’s lack of security allowed hackers to enter his wireless account last fall and steal cryptocoins worth thousands of dollars.

Carlos Tapang of Washington state accuses T-Mobile of having “improperly allowed wrongdoers to access” his wireless account on November 7th last year. The hackers then cancelled his number and transferred it to an AT&T account under their control. “T-Mobile was unable to contain this security breach until the next day,” when it finally got the number back from AT&T, Tapang alleges in the suit, first spotted by Law360.

After gaining control of his phone number, the hackers were able to change the password on one of Tapang’s cryptocurrency accounts and steal 1,000 OmiseGo (OMG) tokens and 19.6 BitConnect coins, Tapang claims.

The hackers then exchanged the coins for 2.875 Bitcoin and transferred it out of his account, the suit states. On November 7th, the price of Bitcoin was $7,118.80, so had the hackers cashed out then, they would have netted a profit of $20,466.55.

Tapang goes on to say, “After the incident, BTC price reached more than $17,000.00 per coin,” but given the volatility of bitcoin prices, the hackers may not have benefited from the soar.

The suit alleges T-Mobile is at fault partly because the carrier said it would add a PIN code to Tapang’s account prior to the incident, but didn’t actually implement it. Tapang also states that hackers are able to call T-Mobile’s customer support multiple times to gain access to customer accounts, until they’re able to get an agent on the line that would grant them access without requiring further identity verification. The complaint also lists several anonymous internet users who have posted about similar security breaches to their own T-Mobile accounts.

Although the suit doesn’t detail how the hackers specifically were able to access Tapang’s account, The Verge has explored a similar Bitcoin-related heist in the past that also involved taking over phone numbers.

Tapang alleges he couldn’t use his cellphone number and had to “expend time, energy, and expense” and also suffered “emotional distress” from the incident, so he’s seeking damages and injunctive relief, which could order T-Mobile to enable more security measures. T-Mobile and Tapang’s lawyer, Boris Davidovskiy, could not be immediately reached for comment.",2018-02-05 00:00:00.000,https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/cryptocurrencies-are-far-from-unregulated,"The chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will testify before Congress Tuesday on one subject and one subject alone: cryptocurrencies.

Panic, hype, price swings and an inane rush to tokenize everything may be the impetus for this hearing, but the message we will likely get from the chairmen won’t be apocalyptic. Instead, expect a confident duet: “We got this.”

The fact is that federal regulators have been thoughtfully on top of cryptocurrency issues for years. And if more oversight is needed in new digital currency markets, that power would best rest with the federal authorities, rather than with the states.

The SEC has rightly shown that several public sales of new tokens inspired by bitcoin fit the definition of securities issuance and, therefore, should have been registered offerings. They started with a warning shot — a thoughtful investigative report last summer — rather than a fusillade of enforcement actions. They have since followed up with targeted enforcement actions. First against clear scammers, and later against naive entrepreneurs who had real products but a poor understanding of regulation, and with those more innocent cases they have not sought civil monetary penalties.

They have also begun an important process of drawing a distinction between “initial coin offerings” that are securities on the one hand, and decentralized cryptocurrencies on the other, which don’t fit the bill and are more suitably regulated as digital commodities such as digital gold (bitcoin), digital fuel (ether), or digital real estate (filecoin/storj).

The CFTC has already classified bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies as commodities and it has, accordingly, been regulating derivative financial products, such as swaps and futures offerings from several exchanges, such as the CME, CBOE and LedgerX. The CFTC has also been clear that it has the authority to police cryptocurrency spot markets for fraud, market manipulation and insider trading — and investigations are underway.

If this all surprises you, maybe it’s because some on Twitter — or the cable news you’ve been barraged with — claim that bitcoin is unregulated. To be clear, it’s not unregulated. There is, however, one thing that distinguishes a bitcoin spot market from a securities or commodities futures exchange: marketplace supervision.

The SEC only supervises exchanges that trade in securities. The SEC has not, however, deemed all cryptocurrencies to be securities, and there are compelling legal and policy reasons why such sweeping classification is unreasonable. Who, after all, could be the issuer of bitcoin? Miners? Software developers? This is rather like asking if gold is a security and then trying to determine who in the gold industry is the issuer of gold. Gold, a valuable asset that exists in the world independent of any promises from a third party issuer or promoter, is rightly classified and regulated as a commodity, just like bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies are and should be.

The CFTC, while it supervises commodities futures exchanges, only has after-the-fact enforcement authority over fraud in spot markets — it does not license and supervise those markets directly.

The supervisory regulators of digital currencies are, somewhat by historical accident, state-by-state money transmission regulators. This means that digital currency exchanges must acquire a license in each and every state in which it has customers, comply with each different state’s differing regulations and explain their business to over 50 different regulators. If that seems odd and inefficient to you, you're not alone. In a recent joint op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Chairmen Clayton and Giancarlo said they “would support policy efforts to revisit these frameworks and ensure they are effective and efficient for the digital era.”

They’re right. State-by-state regulation of inherently global internet money transmitters is inefficient and hurts innovation, financial inclusion, consumer protection and American competitiveness.

The big problem with respect to investor protection, however, is that state money transmission licensing is focused pretty exclusively on solvency and custody risks, not markets. When a customer hands over funds to a money transmitter, they have to trust it to not lose, steal or misdirect their money. The relatively simple issue of ensuring the solvency of digital currency exchanges aside, state money transmission regulations were never intended to deal with emergent investor protection issues inherent in high-volume marketplaces facilitating trading of a variety of speculative new digital assets amongst hundreds of thousands or even millions of active traders.

All told, should investor protection issues in digital currency spot markets need to be addressed via a new supervisory regime, they would be best addressed through a new regime crafted in legislation and perhaps seated within the CFTC. Much of that regime would be focused on investor disclosures, market transparency and guardrails to prevent and police fraud, market manipulation and insider trading, but the legislation should also deal with the more straightforward issue of licensing for exchanges that play a role as custodians and payment providers. It makes no sense to have 53 states and territories offering conflicting regulations in that arena either.

The public policy goals of state money transmission regulators could be subsumed within a larger, CFTC-administered investor protection regime, and state money transmission laws could be fully preempted for newly CFTC-regulated digital currency exchanges.

We’ve yet to see whether there’s any real appetite for that new federal supervisory regime, and it would have to be done through an act of Congress, no small feat. For now, though, it's good to know that the preeminent investor protection regulators here in the U.S., the CFTC and SEC, have got the early policy issues in these new and exciting markets covered.",2018-02-05 14:30:34.215,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-goes-super-crypto-firms-storm-super-bowl-advertisement-stage/,"Every February, the world shifts its eyes toward the biggest sporting event of the year – the Super Bowl.

NFL Players Intrigued by Cryptocurrencies

Veterans of the crypto space should not be surprised by the fact that Bitcoin was mentioned during the Super Bowl. It appears that Bitcoin and other virtual coins have been on the minds of several NFL players, vying to invest in the highly discussed crypto sphere, amid growing buzz across the industry in recent months.

One NFL player who has taken a leading role in the industry is Richard Sherman of the Seattle Seahawks. Sherman has been aware of Bitcoin for some time, prior to the current mainstream craze that has overtaken the sector, as he has been accepting Bitcoin as a payment method on his merchandise website since 2014. Sherman is an investor and owner of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin, among other cryptocurrencies. In addition, he is also a spokesperson for the crypto exchange Cobinhood, which he recently mentioned through his Twitter account.

With regard to which coins he and his fellow NFL players have been showing interest in, he said: “Who knows, You read up, you hear great things about some, you hear terrible things about others, they fluctuate throughout the day. It is such an unpredictable market.” Sherman’s comments illustrate the lack of certainty in the cryptocurrency market, and importance of conducting thorough research to gain the most accurate information possible.

Despite the high risk associated with cryptocurrencies, NFL players have been intrigued by the prospect of gaining high returns on their investments. According to a 2015 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, one in six NFL players files for bankruptcy within 12 years of retirement from the league. That staggering statistic shows the importance for players to plan their financial futures.

Sherman also commented on the need to take steps to improve the financial outlook of players, saying: “A lot of them have just been trying their best to become more educated on not only cryptocurrencies, but just stocks and trading in general. Because a lot of them have been taken advantage of by financial advisers. So people in my sport, in my field, are definitely becoming more educated and trying to be more intelligent with how they play for the money and understanding where their money is going.”

Super Event

The National Football League (NFL) has seen its flagship event come a long way since its 1967 debut. Sports and entertainment fans alike come together on the first Sunday (usually) of February each year, across various venues, including Super Bowl parties, bars all over the US, and other gatherings, to enjoy the game together. It has truly become a spectacle in the US and throughout much of the world, acting as the biggest stage in terms of ratings and viewership. The Super Bowl has long become more than just a sporting event. The event has become entrenched in American culture, and has become an unofficial holiday in the country.

It goes without saying that such a large-scale event has been able to produce enormous financial implications that are felt through advertising revenues, merchandise sales, and the sheer volume of food and beverage sold across the US.

NBC, which purchased the rights to air the Super Bowl this year, is said to have sold each 30-second ad slot for more than $5 million each, illustrating the incredible magnitude of the event, and its effects on consumerism as a whole.

On January 7, the market capitalization or value of the entire cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high of $835.69 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com, a website that takes into account the prices of over 1,000 digital coins across different exchanges. In early trade on Tuesday, the value of the cryptocurrency market had plunged to $278.53 billion, marking a more than $557.1 billion drop since the record high.

It comes as virtual coins across the board take a hammering. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $6,000 for the first time since mid-November on Monday, according to data from CoinDesk. Bitcoin is still significantly higher on the year but down sharply since it recorded an all-time high of $19,783.21 in December.

Even as the leaders of CFTC and the SEC (which regulate commodities and securities in the United States) prepare to testify before Congress regarding cryptocurrencies – the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), an international financial organization with membership from countries that represent 95% of the world’s GDP – came out against cryptocurrencies this morning.

Agustin Carstens, General Manager for BIS, referred to bitcoin as a “combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, and an environmental disaster” and said there was a “strong case” to regulate virtual currencies.

Carstens' statement adds to recent reports of China and India considering regulation limiting use of cryptocurrencies. Collectively, these statements have spooked traders. (See also: China To Crack Down On International Crypto Trading.)

The selloffs intensified this morning as Asian markets came online and the overall market valuation for digital currencies dropped to $276 billion before recovering. At 14:01 UTC, the overall valuation of crypto markets was $335.4 billion, a figure it last touched in December 2017.

Bitcoin Price Briefly Dropped Below $6,000

Bitcoin’s price reflected turmoil in cryptocurrency markets and fell to as low as $5,922 earlier this morning before recovering. As of this writing, it was trading at $7,131.14, up 3.14% from its price 24 hours ago.

But the recovery will not last long, if one were to believe well-known economist Nouriel Roubini. He refers to bitcoin as the “mother of all bubbles” and has forecast a further drop to $5,000 levels again today.

Other cryptocurrencies moved in line with the rest of the market and shed value.

Among the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies, Ripple counterpart Stellar was the biggest loser this morning. Bitcoin cash has shed the most value since the start of 2018, as of this writing.

Will Congressional Testimony Change Regulatory Landscape?

On the radar for cryptocurrency investors today are Congressional testimonies by the leaders of the SEC and CFTC. You can read their testimonies here and here. Briefly, the heads of both agencies are in favor of technological advancements represented by cryptocurrencies.

But this is not a wide-eyed assessment. They have also drawn attention to the importance of sound legal protection and policy in ensuring crypto progress in their testimonies.

Read in their current form, the testimonies are along expected lines, and maintain the status quo with respect to virtual currencies. A severe stance would have further spiraled valuations lower as it would have meant the prospect of restrictive regulation in the future.

At stake in forthcoming regulation is the status of cryptocurrencies and their services. Typical cryptocurrency exchanges are registered as money transmission services within states. But they have to contend with a hodge-podge of different regulations in each state when they set up business. A clear federal directive will help clarify their status and simplify trading processes. In turn, this will help tamp down market volatility as uncertainty is eliminated.

But that is easier said than done. Because they are digital in nature and traded 24x7 on largely unregulated exchanges, cryptocurrencies are a completely new type of trading and asset class. (See also: Bitcoin Has A Regulation Problem.)

In an op-ed for American Banker, Peter Van Valkenburg, research director at Coin Center, called for the creation of a “new supervisory regime” seated within the CFTC.

“The public policy goals of state money transmission regulators could be subsumed within a larger, CFTC-administered investor protection regime, and state money transmission laws could be fully preempted for newly CFTC-regulated digital currency exchanges,” Van Valkenburg wrote.

The creation of a new agency may not make much difference to bitcoin’s price. But the nature and extent of regulation imposed by the new agency will. The threat of regulation in South Korea and China has driven cryptocurrency markets southwards in recent times.

Correlation Between Cryptocurrency Markets and Stock Market?

Given the correspondingly precipitous declines in both markets, one may as well ask that question. After all, it could represent a source of future profits for traders.

To date, the stock market and the crypto market have traded independent of each other. The only tenuous link between them may be the Volatility Index, which has racked up gains as impressive as bitcoin. A recent report by Deustche Bank's Global Financial Strategist posited an inverse correlation between bitcoin and VIX. In other words, the higher the VIX, the less volatile bitcoin's price. But recent events may have shot holes into that theory.

On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin hit $5,920, its lowest since mid-November, before recovering to above $8,000 BTC=BTSP. It hit a high of $8,150 and was last at $7,922.79 in late trading in New York, up nearly 15 percent on the day.

“Crypto is alive and well,” said Matthew Roszak, co-founder and chairman of U.S. blockchain technology company Bloq.

“This whole thing is a movie. It’s not a static feature. We will see continued investment, continued adoption, inspiring developers. This is the real thing.”

Bitcoin has slumped in recent sessions as a risk-off mood spread across financial markets. It has fallen about 70 percent from its peak of almost $20,000 in December and was down more than 40 percent so far this year.

The original cryptocurrency gained more than 1,300 percent last year.

Other digital currencies also rose after posting steep losses the last few weeks. Ethereum, the second-largest by market value, was up 10.7 percent over the past 24 hours at $791.33, while the third-largest, Ripple, edged up nearly 6 percent at 76 U.S. cents, according to cryptocurrency tracker coinmarketcap.com.

The gains came amid a U.S. Senate hearing on virtual currencies in which J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Jay Clayton, chairman at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) testified. The Senate is examining the role of the SEC and CFTC in regulating virtual currencies.

U.S. regulators may ask Congress to pass legislation to improve oversight of virtual currencies like bitcoin amid concerns about the risks posed by the emerging asset class, Clayton said on Tuesday.

After a massive run-up last year, in which investors across the world piled into the market, cryptocurrency prices have skidded lower while regulators have stepped up warnings about the risk of investing in them.

Regulatory clampdowns in South Korea and India and an advertising ban by Facebook Inc FB.O have hit sentiment. Several banks said in recent days that they were banning customers from buying cryptocurrencies with credit cards.

Still, many cryptocurrency backers said regulation should be welcomed and short-term price volatility is to be expected for a new market.

“I think regulators need to learn how to interact with this technology and not stop this,” Bloq’s Roszak said.

“Whenever you see a government banning cryptocurrencies, a bank banning, I think in many ways, that’s them pulling the handbrakes up to better understand how to interact this technology,” he added.

Iqbal Gandham, managing director at trading platform eToro said his company had seen a drop in trading interest from investors in recent weeks amid the selloff, but that interest remained far higher than before the fourth quarter of last year.

After today, they’re going to have plenty to discuss.

Senate Testimony of SEC Chair Clayton

Bitcoiners are looking for any signs of positive news at this point. Set for a 10am Winter hearing Tuesday in the United States Senate Dirksen office building, two of the most powerful regulators in the cryptocurrency space will formally enter their testimony. Titled, Virtual Currencies: The Oversight Role of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, both Jay Clayton of the SEC and the CFTC’s J. Christopher Giancarlo will face lawmakers who are openly worried about the brave new future of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

This particular committee is chaired by Mike Crapo and ranking member Sherrod Brown, and is made up of 23 members total (12 Republican, 11 Democrat). In the US, each state, of which there are 50, receive 2 Senate seats, making the upper, more deliberative body a pound-for-pound most powerful institution in a nation of more than 325 million people. That a quarter of the Senate gets a chance to weigh in on the topic of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, less than 24 hours after one of its biggest crashes, is bound to make news. It’s also a highly charged political year, as Republicans have a hold on the Senate majority heading into the November off-year elections, and both parties are looking for the slightest vulnerability in the other.

Chairman Jay Clayton of the SEC, 51, was nominated by President Trump over a year ago and assumed office last Summer. The SEC had been largely hands-off in the crypto space, and was notoriously reticent about its supposed role in bitcoin’s mainstreaming. No more. Under Mr. Clayton, the SEC became very active late last year, prosecuting bad actors and making more public statements than in prior years. It has slowed approval of what many believed would be key to the digital asset’s success, bitcoin ETFs.

Chair Clayton’s formal testimony entered into the record of the Senate, and pro-forma released to the public a day prior, is a Rorschach test for readers. Bitcoiners can take away a largely balanced, unsurprising approach from the SEC: the agency feels well entitled to regulate the space where it finds securities, especially when it comes to initial coin offerings and other less tested leveraging mechanisms. “I am particularly concerned,” Mr. Clayton wrote, “about market participants who extend to customers credit in U.S. dollars – a relatively stable asset – to enable the purchase of cryptocurrencies, which, in recent experience, have proven to be a more volatile asset.” But he didn’t put the kibosh on ICOs altogether, insisting, “It is possible to conduct an offer and sales of securities, including an ICO, without triggering the SEC’s registration requirements,” believing “an ICO that is a security can be structured so that it qualifies.”

Leave it to States or Feds?

For those unfamiliar with the US concept of federalism, regulation can, and often is, left to the 50 states to work out under general federal guidelines. Some feel this approach is in line with historic governance of the country, while others appreciate 50 laboratories of different methodologies. It’s a version of subsidiarity, whereby the larger national government allows lawmakers closest to the ground their chance at solving whatever issue particular to regional concerns. On broadening federal law to blanket all crypto assets, the Chair hinted to being “open to exploring with Congress, as well as with our federal and state colleagues, whether increased federal regulation of cryptocurrency trading platforms is necessary or appropriate.” For Wall Street, this could be especially good news, considering their penchant for uniformity and expedience. It’s more difficult to say how bitcoiners will interpret the notion.



Furthermore, the Chair assumes “U.S.-based cryptocurrency trading platforms have elected to be regulated as money-transmission services,” his written remarks revealed, “these predominantly state-regulated payment services have not been subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC” as of the present hearing. That could be a signal for some kind of hole lawmakers at the federal level might feel the need to fill.

Significantly, the Chair has, especially in previous published comments, wondered aloud about which cryptos fall where on the regulatory scale, and bitcoiners have largely appreciated his awareness of the distinction. In a market where anything is called a cryptocurrency, even a project with only a PDF and no blockchain, the SEC head seems to understand they’re not all equal. There “are cryptocurrencies that, at least as currently designed, promoted and used, do not appear to be securities,” he clarified. Encouragingly, he briefly outlined how “determining what falls within the ambit of a securities offer and sale is a facts-and-circumstances analysis,” noting how “utilizing a principles-based framework…has served American companies and American investors well through periods of innovation and change for over 80 years.” Bitcoiners might be overjoyed to learn the SEC considers crypto possibly one of those “periods of innovation.”



Careful to not come off Panglossian, Mr. Clayton takes into account the very real concerns of lawmakers going forward. However, “These warnings are not an effort to undermine the fostering of innovation through our capital markets – America was built on the ingenuity, vision and spirit of entrepreneurs who tackled old and new problems in new, innovative ways,” he stressed.

The 71 page document has much more to say, and a great deal of it will be brought out through questioning by lawmakers, but, at least for now, bitcoiners can rest easier knowing no imminent Chinese crackdown is coming to the United States. These pages, of course, will have continued coverage of the hearing as it unfolds.

At a hearing today on cryptocurrency regulation, it was up to J. Christopher Giancarlo, head of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to explain the meaning of the bitcoiner rallying cry “hodl” to the members of the US Senate Banking Committee.

Senator Mike Rounds asked Giancarlo whether bitcoin is a commodity, a security, or a hybrid. The CFTC chairman said it displayed features of multiple asset classes. But when viewed as a store of value like gold, bitcoin behaves “very much like a commodity,” he said.

Giancarlo illustrated his point with a bit of bitcoin trading lexicon:”If you go on to the [bitcoin] Twitter universe, you will see the phrase ‘H-O-D-L,’ meaning hold on for dear life, meaning they buy it and hold it,” he said. He also revealed that his niece is a bitcoin hodl-er.

The hearing also included the head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jay Clayton. The testimonies of the two regulators revealed a number of interesting signs about how cryptocurrencies will be regulated in the future. For example…

The SEC is going after ICOs

Clayton says every ICO he has seen has been a securities offering. The problem is, none of them has registered as offerings with the SEC. “ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings, end of story,” he said.

The SEC is going after lawyers and accountants who enable illegal ICOs

“A note for professionals in these markets: Those who engage in semantic gymnastics and elaborate structuring exercises…are squarely in the cross-hairs of our enforcement division,” Clayton said.

But some ICOs, like those conducted with a “SAFT” agreement, are probably safe

This includes some of the biggest offerings of last year, like Filecoin, with marquee investors like Union Square Ventures. “I don’t think it necessarily follows that the SAFT is within the SEC’s sights,” said Preston Byrne, a structured-finance lawyer and a fellow at the Adam Smith Institute. Byrne has been a major critic of ICOs.

The SEC draws a distinction between “pure cryptocurrencies” and ICOs

It’s not entirely clear what that distinction might be. But Clayton said ICOs should be regulated like securities offerings, without mentioning the regulatory status of “pure cryptocurrencies.”

US Congress could give the SEC or CFTC more powers to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges

“I think we may need [additional legislative authority], I think we may need it,” Clayton said.

The FBI is assisting

The FBI has recently seconded agents to the CFTC to analyze transactions in the bitcoin futures and spot markets to detect signs of terrorist financing and evasion of sanctions by countries like North Korea, Giancarlo said. The oversight might explain the recent bitcoin price crash. Said Giancarlo, “Word is getting out that we will go after misconduct, I think you’re seeing it in the price, and it’s an important step.”

Don’t expect a bitcoin ETF any time soon

Clayton said the fact that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are aimed at long-only retail investors, combined with issues concerning price discovery, custody, and volatility, mean that the regulator isn’t comfortable with green-lighting any applications yet.

The crypto industry believes the hearing went well. Both Giancarlo and Clayton talked up the potential of “distributed ledger technology,” although Giancarlo noted that there would be no blockchain without bitcoin. The technology has “enormous potential,” Giancarlo said.

Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a blockchain-focused think tank in Washington DC, said the hearing showed that lawmakers want to fight crypto frauds and scams while letting Americans exercise a right to own cryptocurrencies. One prominent lawyer, who advises corporations on cryptocurrency matters, judged the SEC chief’s comments to be “neutral” while assessing the CFTC chief’s remarks as “positive.”

Crypto is turning out to be the rare industry where regulation is welcomed rather than opposed.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/06/us-government-is-trying-to-get-coordinated-in-its-efforts-to-regulate-bitcoin.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testifies to the House Financial Services Committee on ""The Annual Report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 6, 2018.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is taking the lead on bringing together federal government agencies to coordinate regulation of cryptocurrencies, the chairmen of two financial regulatory commissions said Tuesday.

""The Treasury secretary has been out in front on this. He's formed a virtual currency working group of ourselves, the SEC, the Fed"" and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said J. Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He was speaking in response to a question at a hearing on cryptocurrencies held by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

Bitcoin has lost half its value this year after surging 2,000 percent in just 12 months to a record high above $19,000 in mid-December. Sales of new digital coins, called initial coin offerings or ICOs, have raised more than $4 billion in sales of new digital coins for projects based on the same blockchain technology behind bitcoin.

However, critics say many of the projects barely exist beyond whitepapers or are outright scams, and both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC have increased their crackdown on fraudulent schemes.

""We've had a number of preliminary conversations and workstreams developed,"" Giancarlo said. ""We are going to be coordinating our various responses. It's begun with just some broad conversations just establishing our different jurisdictions so we're all clear as to what we're doing, and what we're not doing, where the gaps are.""

Giancarlo added that he and Mnuchin have had a number of one-on-one conversations about virtual currencies.

Mnuchin said in a mid-January speech that the Treasury Department's Financial Stability Oversight Council has formed a virtual currency working group, according to CoinDesk. Mnuchin has also said he wants to make sure that ""bad people"" cannot use bitcoin for illegal activities.

The latest gyrations came as a leading central banker described the cryptocurrency as “a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”.

The new head of the Bank for International Settlements, Agustín Carstens, also said bitcoin threatened to undermine public trust in central banks and posed a threat to financial stability, and he signalled a global clampdown.

“If authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability,” he said, speaking at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Hide Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.



“There is a strong case for policy intervention. Appropriate authorities have a duty to educate and protect investors and consumers, and need to be prepared to act.”

Carstens, a former governor of Mexico’s central bank, said that despite the meteoric rise of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies were merely pretending to be currencies and were unsafe, potentially facilitating tax evasion, money laundering and criminal finance.

As the head of the body that represents the world’s central banks, his comments are the clearest sign yet that global regulators are preparing a crackdown on bitcoin, the price of which rose by 900% last year, making it the best-performing asset of 2017. It hit a peak of almost $20,000 in the week before Christmas.

However, it has fallen by more than 50% since the beginning of 2018, as investors grow increasingly fearful of intervention by regulators.

Bitcoin is not recognised by any central bank. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment methods to pay for goods and services.

Carstens said central banks should in particular pay attention to the ties linking cryptocurrencies to real currencies, to ensure the relationship was “not parasitic”.

His comments follow a string of warnings on bitcoin from authorities and economists around the world, including India, the US and South Korea. Facebook has banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrency adverts on its site.

Bitcoin fell below $6,000 but is now back above $7,000.



LONDON — Bitcoin is back above $7,000 on Tuesday afternoon, after wild price swings saw it briefly drop below $6,000 earlier in the session.

Bitcoin briefly fell below $6,000 at around 8.00 a.m. GMT (3.00 a.m. ET) for the first time since mid-November.

Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said on Tuesday morning: ""The most famous digital currency has fallen 69% from December’s record high, and almost 56% from the start of the year.""

Ethereum, litecoin, bitcoin cash, and ripple also posted double-digit percentage losses early on Tuesday morning. Ethereum was down 18% at one stage.

But cryptos made up ground lunchtime in Europe and now, with the US awake, major cryptocurrencies are now positive.

Here's the scoreboard at 1.55 p.m. GMT (8.55 a.m. ET):

Despite making up ground, bitcoin is still down around 35% over the last 7 days. From a peak of $830 billion at the start of January, the global cryptocurrency market has now shrunk to $330 billion, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.com.

Tuesday's wild session follows carnage in the crypto market on Friday and a market slump in early January.

The latest dive comes in tandem with a global stock market rout but that appears to be uncorrelated with the crypto crash.

Commentators have been blaming fears of regulation, cooling interest from Asia, and fears over the role cryptocurrency Tether plays in the bitcoin market. Banks are also clamping down on customers buying cryptocurrencies on their credit cards.

Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at foreign exchange business Centtrip, said in an email on Monday night: ""Governments across the globe continue to clamp down on retail investors speculating on cryptocurrencies, with the People’s Bank of China stating it would step up measures to remove any onshore or offshore platforms related to virtual currency trading or ICOs, ‘to prevent financial risks’.""",2018-02-06,https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-confirms-4-banks-blocking-bitcoin-purchases-on-credit-cards,"Credit card holders from four U.S. banks have been barred from purchasing cryptocurrencies using credit cards at Coinbase, the exchange has confirmed.

However, other payment channels such as debit cards and bank transfer are still available, and are being encouraged by Coinbase as alternatives for affected customers.

The notice came as a confirmation to a recent report that Chase, Bank of America and Citi had launched the ban starting in early February over fears that credit card users may run up debt if the prices of cryptocurrencies drop. It further indicates that the restriction also extends to Capital One, another major credit card issuer in the U.S.

This news also arrives amid a major price correction across the crypto markets in the last few weeks. According to CoinDesk’s latest report, bitcoin’s price has dropped to a 12-week low around $6,000. On the same date in January, prices were closer to $17,000.

Data from CoinMarketCap also indicates that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization slumped today to under $300 billion for the first time since Nov. 25, 2017.

The trend to bar bitcoin buying with credit cards is not just being seen in the U.S. market.

As reported yesterday, British banking group Lloyds has also reportedly blocked card holders from several of its major subsidiaries – including Halifax, MBNA and Bank of Scotland – from purchasing bitcoin on credit.

Experts told CNBC today, Feb. 7, that the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies could reach $1 trillion and that BTC itself could hit $50,000 by the end of this year.

Jamie Burke, CEO at Outlier Ventures, Europe’s first Blockchain-based incubator, told CNBC that the predicted bull run will be followed by a general settling down of the market:

""We believe after February the market will likely go on a bull run comparative if not greater than last year potentially reaching the trillion-dollar mark before a proper crypto winter sets in where the market becomes more focused on proper market fundamentals.”

Thomas Glucksmann, head of APAC business at Gatecoin, sees regulation, the introduction of institutional capital, and technological advances like the Lightning Network as the main factors in rising cryptocurrency prices. He told CNBC over email:

""There is no reason why we couldn't see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December.""

Back in April 2017 when BTC reached a former high of $1,300, Glucksmann had commented on the connection between the price jump and the start of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) month-long review of the Winklevoss twins Bitcoin ETF proposal.

The joint SEC and The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) hearings held yesterday, Feb. 6, on their roles in the cryptocurrency sphere may have helped cause the market to see substantial rebound today, Feb. 7.

Glucksmann also wrote that a possible element in market growth going forward could be the release of a cryptocurrency-based ETF, similar to when BTC’s price shot up to $16,800 in Dec. 2017 after the CBOE’s futures launch:

""One possible appetizer for the bulls, or the catalyst for the recovery, will be the release of another cryptocurrency backed instrument listed on a major exchange. There are several candidates in the pipeline, it's only a matter of time until we have a cryptocurrency backed ETF (exchange-traded fund).""

Utility tokens like IOTA, NEO, and Ethereum are also something to watch in the coming months, CEO of Hercules Tech Mick Sherman told NBC:

""Utility tokens and assets with a working platform and a clear-cut reason for requiring both a blockchain and their own token, are more likely to appreciate in value this year. Some of these cryptoassets will not be used for years, meaning they have no utility value.”

Ran Neuner, host of CNBC’s show CryptoTrader, has pinned his Feb. 1 tweet that predicted Bitcoin hitting $50,000 at the end of 2018:",,https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/bitcoin-crypto-prices-mount-a-comeback/,"What goes up, must go down… what does down, must go up…?

After a big and bloody plunge this week — which saw the price of bitcoin touch a two-month low of sub-$6,000 — the crypto market has mounted a comeback with double-digit gains across the board.

Coinmarketcap.com — the current go-to for crypto pricing — shows that bitcoin is up 26 percent in the last 24 hours to $8,200 following that bloodbath. Of the remaining top five: Ethereum is up 32 percent over the same period, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash both rose by 22 percent, and Cardano is up 25 percent.

Of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies, all have seen gains of at least 20 percent with NEO, in particular, clocking an increase of more than 55 percent.

The gains continue right down the tail, with Coinmarketcap.com’s top 100 most-valued cryptocurrencies all posting increases over the last 24 hours.

The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies is estimated at over $390 billion, with bitcoin representing 35 percent of that figure.

That marks a recovery, but the total market cap is still some way down from where it has been lately. We reported that it was at $459 billion last week, having been as high as $830 billion in early January.

That’s the what, so what about the why?

Well, nobody knows for sure when it comes to the pricing highs and lows of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but the past week has certainly been eventful in terms of news and signals.

Just yesterday, a U.S. Senate cryptocurrency hearing struck an unexpectedly optimistic tone on the current state of play. While SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Christopher Giancarlo voiced concern over a lack of regulation and potential security violations, the focus seemed to be on removing unsavory factors rather than killing crypto altogether.

The run-in to the hearing, however, had seen concern after a number of banks and credit card agencies made it harder for consumers to buy bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Last week comments from Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley were widely interpreted as a harsh crackdown on cryptocurrency, inspiring broad regulatory fears on an international scale.

“The government does not recognize cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system,” Jaitley said during a budget speech in which he also expressed interest in blockchain technology.

While his comments focused on illegitimate activity, reports suggesting the statement signaled a broader cryptocurrency ban seemed off-base since all overseas currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are also not recognized as legal tender in India. Bitcoin is simply another addition to that list, based on the minister’s comments.

Then, in a further update in South Korea — a well-known crypto buying hub — a new ‘know your customer’ rule went into effect to mandate the use of real names for cryptocurrency trading. Despite previous reports and comment from some members of the government, Korean authorities have indicated that they plan to regulate rather than outlaw bitcoin and other crypto.

How does all this fit back into today’s price jump?

The U.S. Senate hearing and seeming progress in Korea and India may indicate potential levels of acceptance and regulated existence for crypto in the future.

BUT, the increase in prices could also be down to nothing more than crypto fans ‘buying in dip.’ That’s kind of the beauty of it all. You can lay out all the theories you want, but the market movements may be down to nothing more than opportunistic buying from the crypto masses.

Disclosure: The author owns a small amount of bitcoin and Ethereum.",2018-02-07,https://www.aei.org/economics/the-price-of-bitcoin-and-other-virtual-currencies-a-simple-case-of-supply-and-demand/,"Blog Post

AEIdeas

What determines the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? With few exceptions, cryptocurrencies are fiat currency — they are not backed by anything. Their value is derived exclusively by what people are willing to pay for them. The simple framework of supply and demand can identify many of the forces that are creating large price swings in these virtual currencies.

Because individual cryptocurrency supplies are tightly controlled over the short run, day-to-day variation in the value of cryptocurrencies is driven by changes in cryptocurrency demand. Demand for cryptocurrency is derived from a number of distinct economic functions that cryptocurrency can facilitate.

People negotiate trades to buy or sell goods, services, and national currencies in exchange for cryptocurrency and pay for these trades by transferring cryptocurrency between virtual wallets. The transaction does not use the banking system. It uses the self-contained blockchain and internet account addresses in place of bank account numbers.

The amount of cryptocurrency demand generated by small value trades of goods, services, and national currencies depends on the relative cost and acceptability of using cryptocurrencies. The transactions cost and exchange rate used to convert cryptocurrency into national currency (and vice versa) are updated continuously in unregulated intermediaries called cryptocurrency exchanges. Exchanges charge a fee to process and match customer buy and sell orders to exchange national currencies for selected cryptocurrencies.

The demand for cryptocurrency to facilitate small value transactions depends in part on the cost and availability of close substitute transactions services. For small payments, cryptocurrencies directly compete with financial institutions and informal remittance mechanisms such as PayPal and hawala, respectively.

Because both hawala and cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, they are popular among those transacting in illegal goods and services or funding illegal activities or terrorism. One recent paper estimates that nearly 24 million bitcoin market participants and nearly half of all bitcoin transactions can be linked to illegal activities.

In addition to these channels of demand, second-generation cryptocurrencies can be used to execute an array of transactions using so-called smart contracts. These cryptocurrencies can be used to execute complex tasks on the cryptocurrencies’ blockchain. Smart contracts can do more than just transfer virtual currency from one virtual wallet to another.

CryptoKitties is a smart contract that uses the Ethereum blockchain. It allows people to use the cryptocurrency Ether to buy, breed, and sell CryptoKitties. (Why anyone would want to do this is beyond me.) Still, the point is, newer generations of cryptocurrencies have blockchain algorithms that can perform new functions beyond just transferring cryptocurrency between virtual wallets. The new functionality is designed to generate an additional source of cryptocurrency demand.

A final source of cryptocurrency demand are the virtual wallets of agents that buy, sell, and “hodl” (hold) cryptocurrency as they attempt to generate capital gains. Such investors may undertake arbitrage between cryptocurrency exchanges, speculate on cryptocurrency price volatility, or simple buy and hold cryptocurrency if they believe that the virtual currency is a long-term appreciating asset.

Shocks in the demand for cryptocurrencygenerate cryptocurrency price volatility. In the past, demand shocks have been associated with news that authorities have identified and closed illegal operations that rely on cryptocurrency payments system. Actors associated with the illegal operation or related operations are forced to move or exchange cryptocurrency quickly, often multiple times, as they attempt to evade detection. Moreover, such policing actions often trigger new government actions to control or prohibit the use of cryptocurrencies. All these factors curtail the cryptocurrency demand related to illegal activities.

News of losses at cryptocurrency exchanges due to hacking also generate shocks in cryptocurrency demand and price volatility as users reassess the safety of their cryptocurrency holdings. Many agents respond to such news by exchanging their cryptocurrencies for national currency or by moving positions to virtual wallets with greater perceived security.

Finally, just like any speculative financial product, changes in investor expectations can create wild swings in cryptocurrency demand. Technical trading, speculation, and loss of confidence among “hodling” investors can generate large swings in cryptocurrency prices.

Cryptocurrencies have evolved quickly, and plans are in place to introduce new cryptocurrencies at a rapid pace. Given these dynamics, it is unclear to me why investors should expect a single individual cryptocurrency like bitcoin to be an appreciating asset over the long term. New blockchains and cryptocurrencies can and are being created. Few national currency supplies are as uncontrolled. There are no limits on the number of virtual currencies that can be created.

In the short run, cryptocurrency bubbles can inflate and deflate, creating the opportunity for bubble-surfers to harvest gains and post losses. But in the long run, it seems unlikely to me that cryptocurrencies will replace national currencies as the primary vehicle for facilitating trade.

It was therefore only a matter of time before they released a cryptocurrency version of their rich list. The names featured are hardly surprising. Those closely allied to the likes of Ethereum and Ripple have done well for themselves, as have the earliest investors in the space. Let’s take a look at the top ten.

10. Mike Novogratz, CEO Galaxy Digital

You probably know Mike Novogratz from our reportage of his seemingly endless bullish comments about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The former billionaire left his Fortress Investment Group in 2015 to focus on cryptocurrency. He’s since built up an estimated crypto net worth of $700 million to $1 billion dollars. Talk about the comeback kid!

9. Brock Pierce, Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, Advisor at Block.One

Brock was one of the first big pioneers of digital currency. He’s been responsible for funding dozens of startups in the space. These have included Mastercoin, Coinbase, and Ethereum. The former child actor now claims that he’s willing to donate $1 billion to a decentralised autonomous community run on the blockchain. His savvy invesetment strategy has helped the 37 year old amass an estimated crypto net worth of $700 million to $1 billion.

8. Anthony Di Iorio, Cofounded Ethereum, Founded Jaxx and Decentral

This 43 year old investor has manager is currently worth an estimated $750 million to $1 billion in crypto assets alone. He was influential in the founding of the Ethereum blockchain platform that supports the second largest cryptocurrency, Ether. Di Iorio’s investment strategy is simple: Look for promising new ideas and jump ship with the gains after a period of parabolic growth. Easy, huh?

7. Matthew Roszak, Cofounder of Bloq, Founder of Tally Capital

Roszak attributes his success in the cryptocurrency space to timing. Namely, he was in very early. The 45 year old investor learned about Bitcoin in 2011 and was savvy enough to get involved in the first wave of Initial Coin Offerings. It’s even reported that he gave Richard Branson and Bill Clinton their first Bitcoins. Roszak is estimated to be worth $900 million to $1 billion in crypto wealth alone.

6. Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase

Shock horror. The CEO of Coinbase made the list of the richest folk involved in cryptocurrency. Whilst many of his peers were busy buying up a new asset class, Armstrong was selling them means to prospect with. Coinbase are one of the most well-known companies in the entire space and the first entry point into cryptocurrency for many. Today it’s estimated his digital currency net worth is between $900 million and $1 billion.

5. Matthew Mellon, Investor

With an estimated cryptocurrency net worth of $900 million to $1 billion, Mellon certainly has played his cards right. The 54 year old investor saw an opportunity early in Ripple and bought up their token, XRP, despite warnings from friends and family. It’s clearly paid off for him.

4. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Cofounders Winklevoss Capital

Yeah, they might be two people but be honest, have you ever seen a news story with one and not the other? Together, the Winklevoss Twins’ combined cryptocurrency net worth is estimated at between $900 million and $1.1 billion. The pair invested early in Bitcoin and simply held it. Since then, they’ve set up the New York-based exchange, Gemini. In a space rife with scandal and security breaches, Gemini is something of a trusted entity in cryptocurrency, so much so that the Chicago Board Options Exchange use their price index to settle their recently launched futures contracts.

3. Changpeng Zhao, CEO Binance

Binance came out of nowhere less than seven months ago and under Zhao’s leadership have grown into the largest cryptocurrency exchange on the planet. Zhao, known more colloquially as “CZ”, has dodged regulatory pressures by moving his companies to three different territories in its short existence. CZ has an impressive estimated crypto net worth of $1.1 to $2 billion.

2. Joseph Lubin, Cofounder of Ethereum, Founder of ConsenSys

This former Goldman Sachs executive helped fund the blockchain platform Ethereum, as well as founding ConsenSys. The latter today employs over 600 people and spans an impressive 28 countries. ConsenSys have helped launch many companies and their tokens. They’re also used for consulting services for global giants such as Microsoft. Lubin is estimated to be worth in the range of $1 to $5 billion.

1. Chris Larsen, Cofounder of Ripple

Sitting atop the cryptocurrency rich list is non other than the cofounder of Ripple, Chris Larsen. This is largely due to the dubious initial distribution of XRP. Larsen himself owns 5.2 billion XRP. Despite (or perhaps because of) the wider cryptocurrency community’s general condemnation of Ripple, they’ve found their niche facilitating international payments for banks. It’s estimated that Larsen’s crypto assets are worth between $7.5 and $8 billion.

Ogling the fortunes of the filthy rich is a popular pastime with the poorer segments of society. It’s been that way for centuries, with 1849 marking the debut of Who’s Who, a 250-page guide “of living noteworthy and influential individuals, from all walks of life, worldwide.” In more recent years, Forbes has picked up the baton with its annual Rich List which reveals how the 1% are faring. Predictably, the U.S. publication has now launched its own crypto edition for the community to pore over. One name who doesn’t make the list, though, is the most famous and moneyed of all – Satoshi Nakamoto.

The Shifting Sands of Crypto Riches

It would be nice to pretend that decentralization and the separation of money and state are the primary motivators for people flocking to crypto. The truth is often more vulgar though. Do an internet search for Vitalik Buterin or any other major crypto figure and the autocomplete result that follows will inevitably be “net worth”. Human curiosity is a powerful urge, and money – in all its forms – is a natural magnet for the envious and the curious.

Due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, putting a precise dollar price on the entrants’ wealth is impossible, as Forbes readily admits, noting: “It’s a near certainty that we’ve missed some people and that some of our estimates are wide of the mark. But this was equally true when we launched the first Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans in 1982. At the time, many people said we couldn’t—or shouldn’t—publish. We did so anyway, firm in the belief that we made the world a better place by shining a light on the invisible rich.”

Controversially, it then adds: “Fortunes of this magnitude should never be allowed to lurk in the shadows.” This is a contentious claim, and one which privacy proponents – of whom the crypto community has many – would take issue with. Of course, blockchains are public and fully auditable, and thus concealing huge amounts of cryptocurrency wealth is extremely difficult. Figures such as Vitalik Buterin, who has previously protested the avarice which is now endemic to the industry, won’t take kindly to featuring here, but will surely concede that with great wealth comes great public scrutiny.

Crypto Fortunes Broken Down

To gain entry to Forbes’ Crypto Rich List, a minimum fortune of $350 million is required – or around 41,000 BTC at current prices. Ripple’s Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse both feature of course, but then it’s easy to manufacture wealth when you create 100 billion units of your own cryptocurrency and then keep the bulk of the supply in the company coffers. Both men are undoubtedly billionaire rich, though in reality would be incapable of cashing out their vast XRP fortune in a hurry.

It’s fair to say Larsen or Garlinghouse won’t be struggling to pay the bills anytime soon though, nor will Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong who also features. The Winklevoss twins naturally make the list along with such luminaries as Michael Novogratz, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson and EOS founder Dan Larimer. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit to emerge from the list, albeit an unsurprising one, is that the average age of its members is 42, versus 67 for Forbes’ traditional rich list. Both lists are still populated by white men, but in crypto those men have a lot less wrinkles.

While fleetingly fun, the Crypto Rich List does nothing to advance understanding of cryptocurrencies or appreciation for their transformative power. The men who made the list had the conviction to see the potential in cryptocurrencies when their peers dismissed them out of hand, and have been handsomely rewarded for their endeavors. For all its crassness, the Forbes Crypto Rich List is sure to become an annual staple that gives mainstream media a cryptocurrency angle the public can comprehend, and gives the crypto community something to debate, not only on account of who made the grade, but on account of the crypto whales who are noticeably absent.

Speaking of whales, in 2015 a 95% stake in Forbes was bought by Integrated Whale Media Investments. The Hong Kong-based public and private equity group, headed by a consortium of Chinese investors, then got ensnared in a protracted legal battle with Forbes over its failure to pay interest due on the $415 million deal. The matter was eventually settled out of court. Asians are in short supply on the Forbes Crypto Rich List, with only the CEOs of Binance and Upbit earning a place.

Bitcoinocracy is a free and decentralized way to measure the Bitcoin community’s stance on a given proposition. Check vote.Bitcoin.com.",2018-02-07 17:30:44+00:00,https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/5-most-predictable-cryptocurrencies-ethereum-bitcoin-cash-litecoin-bitcoin-iota-201802071335,"The prices of cryptocurrencies change quite rapidly and can be wild. With high attention and trading volumes, patterns are emerging, and technical trading becomes more and more useful. A predictable cryptocurrency slows down and turns back at a clear line of support or resistance. And when momentum is strong enough, the coin makes a clear break and leaves only dust behind it. These are the more predictable coins. Yet not all cryptos are born equal and some trade in a messy and choppy manner, making them less predictable and harder to trade.

Here are the top 5 most predictable cryptocurrencies, each with its characteristics:

Ethereum: The ""flippening"" has not happened regarding market cap, but Ethereum ranks as the most predictable cryptocurrency. When the coin breaks out, ETH tends to mark the top or bottom of the range and then trade between the previous line and the new line, respecting the range. Also, its lower highs served as bearish signs, as one would expect. Ethereum also has a good memory for older lines. Bitcoin Cash: BCH has been in existence only for a short while, but its performance has been quite remarkable. Similar to ETH, BCH tends to mark the extreme of the new range upon a breakout. Its memory for old lines still falls short, despite its short history. Nevertheless, the clear separation of ranges is noteworthy. Litecoin: LTC tends to trend in clear moves to the upside or the downside. It also had an impressive double-bottom of late. The sharper moves were telling, as they indicated the trends via lower highs or higher lows, yet these sharp moves can sometimes be nasty. Bitcoin: The poster-child for the blockchain technology has a long history and high trading volumes, and this also helps in its predictability. Its uptrends and downtrends are quite straightforward, and it also respects the ranges. The reason for not placing it in the top spot also stems from its popularity: a few panic sell-offs it had suffered undermined its position. BTC tends to perform better when attention moves away from it. IOTA: This virtual coin used to be quite choppy and had an impulsive behavior, but things recently improved. The cryptocurrency is enjoying both range trading and clear trends at the same time. The sketchier past of IOT limits its predictability going forward.

There are clearly a few notable digital currencies which are not on the list and worth mentioning:

Ripple: XRP shot to stratosphere like a Falcon but fell very heavily. The moves on the charts are erratic.

Cardano: ADA may be in the top 5 concerning market cap, but the charts do not provide any useful information.

NEO: The emerging crypto coin has a potential to enter the list, but it's still too choppy.

Other cryptocurrencies such as Stellar (XLM), EOS, NEM, and even Dash all have occasionally had clear days of trading followed by messy ones.

Steve Strongin, head of Goldman Sachs global investment research, said in a note dated Monday, that cryptocurrencies don't have ""intrinsic value"" adding that it's ""unlikely"" whether any of today's digital currencies are likely to survive in the long run.

""People seem to be trading cryptocurrencies as though they're all going to survive, or at least maintain their value. The high correlation between the different cryptocurrencies worries me. Contrary to what one would expect in a rational market, new currencies don't seem to reduce the value of old currencies; they all seem to move as a single asset class,"" Strongin said.

""But if you believe this is a 'few-winners take-most' situation, then the potential for retirement depreciation should be taken into account. And because of the lack of intrinsic value, the currencies that don't survive will most likely trade to zero.""

The Goldman research note comes after a violent sell-off in the cryptocurrency market over the past few days, which at its lowest point on Tuesday, saw over $550 billion of value wiped off the market.

The cryptocurrency had a market capitalization or value of $135 billion on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk data, after the price recovered following a violent sell-off. Forty times this would be over $5 trillion.

Cameron Winklevoss made the call after comparing bitcoin to gold during a CNBC-hosted chat at the Milken Institute's MENA Summit.

""Taking bitcoin in isolation … we believe bitcoin disrupts gold. We think it's a better gold if you look at the properties of money. And what makes gold gold? Scarcity. Bitcoin is actually fixed in supply so it's better than scarce … it's more portable, its fungible, it's more durable. Its sort of equals a better gold across the board,"" Winklevoss told CNBC.

""So if you look at a $100 billion market cap today, now last week it might have been more like 200, so it's actually a buying opportunity, we think that there's a potential appreciation of 30 to 40 times because you look at the gold market today, it's a $7 trillion market. And so a lot of people are starting to see that, they recognize the store of value properties. So we think regardless of the price moves in the last few weeks, it's still a very underappreciated asset.""

Even at the lower $100 billion market cap, a 40 times price appreciation would peg bitcoin's value at $4 trillion. Winklevoss did not give a time period but throughout the interview, mentioned he and his brother Tyler were taking a 10-to-20-year view.",2018-02-07,,,

Bitcoin’s gyrations have attracted a lot of attention over the past year. Here are some of the most memorable comments from senior figures in world finance.

Yves Mersch

Yves Mersch, a member of the European Central Bank’s executive board, called for a global clampdown on virtual currencies because of their threat to financial stability on 8 February. Bitcoin transactions can easily take several hours to process, he noted in a speech in London.

At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed.”

Agustín Carstens

The new head of the Bank for International Settlements has described bitcoin as “a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”.

“If authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability,” he said in a speech on 6 February.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Hide Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.



Nouriel Roubini

The American economist credited with predicting the 2008 financial crash has called bitcoin “the mother of all bubbles” and “much worse” than tulip mania. He told Bloomberg TV on 2 February: “It’s on the way down to zero. The fundamental value of bitcoin is zero.”

He said the other 1,300-plus cryptocurrencies were “even worse” and slammed the underlying blockchain technology. He added that blockchain has been around for 10 years and its only application is bitcoin or cryptocurrencies and they “are a scam”.

Roubini tweeted this week: “Cryptocrazies are also criminal Cyber-Terrorists.” He also claimed that his consulting firm, Roubini Global Economics, was targeted in a 2015 denial-of-service attack because he criticised bitcoin.

Jamie Dimon

JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said in mid-September that Bitcoin was a fraud that would ultimately blow up. He said the digital currency was only fit for use by drug dealers, murderers and people living in places such as North Korea.

The boss of America’s biggest bank said he would fire “in a second” anyone at the investment bank found to be trading in bitcoin. He later softened his stance, and revealed on 9 January that his daughter had bought two bitcoins.

Robert Shiller

The Nobel prizewinning economist predicted on 26 January that bitcoin would not be a “permanent feature” of the financial world. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Shiller hailed bitcoin as a “really clever idea”.

I tend to think of bitcoin as an experiment. It is an interesting experiment, but it’s not a permanent feature of our lives.”

Shiller has previously warned that the bitcoin price could collapse. “We are over-emphasising bitcoin, we should expand it out to blockchain, which will have other applications.”

Warren Buffett

The billionaire investor said on 11 January he would never invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and predicted the wildly popular assets were in for a fall.

“I can say almost with certainty that cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end,” Buffett told CNBC in an interview.

Joseph Stiglitz

The Nobel-prize-winning economist has argued that the currency should be outlawed. “It doesn’t serve any socially useful function.”

Sir Howard Davies

The chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland has painted an apocalyptic picture for bitcoin. He told Bloomberg TV on 8 December, after bitcoin hit $15,000 for the first time:

Put up the sign from Dante’s Inferno – ‘Abandon hope all ye who enter here’ – I think that’s probably what’s needed.”

Janet Yellen

On 15 December, the former US Federal Reserve chair described bitcoin as a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable source of value”, but noted it remained a very small part of the global payment system. She also reiterated her 2014 position that the Fed does not have the authority to regulate the cryptocurrency.

Theresa May

Theresa May said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that she was concerned criminals were exploiting digital currencies, which can be used to anonymously transfer funds. “In areas like cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, we should be looking at these very seriously,” May told Bloomberg.

Steven Mnuchin

The US treasury secretary also flagged up concerns about misuse of digital currencies. “My number one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” Mnuchin told CNBC.

People flocked to Tor sites like Silk Road to buy things like drugs and weapons, and they paid with bitcoin.

Now, things have changed. A new report from the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, cited by Bloomberg, shows that online criminals are turning away from bitcoin and flocking to other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Dash. While bitcoin is still the most-used coin on dark web marketplaces, these other two choices are becoming more commonplace as well. According to Recorded Future’s survey, 30% of dark web vendors accept Litecoin, and 20% accept Dash.

This dynamic shift is likely due to bitcoin’s insane price rise over the last year (of course, it’s seen a huge drop over the last month), as well as the problems it’s had with slow transactions due to the cryptocurrency’s popularity.

Forbes magazine, which tracks and produces annual rankings of the world's wealthiest people, has come out with its first list of cryptocurrency billionaires.

The list comprises a wide array of players within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Developers and founders of trading exchanges, which oil the wheels of the crypto ecosystem, are members of the list as are big-name investors and financiers. (See also: Who Are The Top 5 Bitcoin Billionaires?)

It is reflective of the secretive and opaque world of cryptocurrencies. Only a couple of names listed in the rankings have discussed or disclosed their actual holding amounts of virtual currencies.

This is a problem since there are no public filings, similar to the SEC disclosures, available for Forbes to confirm its figures. As a result, the magazine’s wealth estimates for individuals sometimes span a broad range.

The rankings are also indicative of the relatively nascent nature of the industry and includes individuals who founded companies and coins less than a year ago, but are considered billionaires today based on market valuations and trading volumes.

The Wealthiest People In Cryptocurrencies

Chris Larsen, co-founder of Ripple, was ranked as the wealthiest man in cryptocurrencies with an estimated net worth of $7.5 billion to $8 billion. A majority of his wealth is tied up in XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency. Larsen is estimated to hold 5.19 billion XRP and became one of the world’s richest men, ahead of Facebook Inc. (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg, when XRP’s price surged at the end of 2017. (See also: Ripple's Execs Are Now Billionaires Thanks To XRP's Success.)

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin takes the second spot with a net worth of $1 billion to $5 billion. Changpeng Zhao, the Tokyo-based founder of Binance - the hottest new exchange in town, is ranked third, with wealth estimated between $1.1 billion and $2 billion. Binance was launched in July 2017 and has already racked up 6 million users and $7.5 million in commission fees (as of December 2017).

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who recently became the first known billionaires in bitcoin, and Matthew Mellon, heir to the banking dynasty, rounded out the top five, with an estimated net worth of $900 million to $1 billion.

Chris Larsen, Co-founder of Ripple: $7.5 to $8 billion Joseph Lubin, Co-founder of Ethereum: $1 billion to $1.5 billion Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance: $1.1 billion to $2 billion Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Co-founders of Gemini: $900 million to $1.1 billion Matthew Mellon, Individual investor: $900 million to $1 billion Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase: $900 million to $1 billion Matthew Roszak, Co-founder of Bloq: $900 million to $1 billion Anthony Di Iorio, Co-founder of Ethereum: $750 million to $1 billion Brock Pierce, Chairman of Bitcoin Foundation: $700 million to $1 billion Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital: $700 million to $1 billion Brendan Blumer, CEO of Block.one: $600 million to $700 million Dan Larimer, CTO in Block.one: $600 million to $700 million Valery Vavilov, CEO of Bitfury: $500 million to $700 million Charles Hoskinson, Co-founder of Ethereum and IOHK (Cardano): $500 million to $600 million Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple: $400 million to $500 million Barry Silbert, CEO of Digital Currency Group: $400 million to $500 million Vitalik Buterin, Creator of Ethereum: $400 million to $500 million

An Unequal Industry

The rise of cryptocurrency millionaires has been rapid and impressive. But it hides the fact that the industry rewards unequally. Investors have swooped in to profit from the hard work of developers.

As Nathaniel Popper from the New York Times points out, prominent developers have not made much money. For example, Ripple’s Jed McCaleb does not seem to have benefited from its cryptocurrency’s price increase as much as its investors and CEOs.

Similarly 24-year-old Vitalik Buterin, who developed the ethereum smart contract platform, is ranked a distant 17th, well below his other co-founders Lubin and Anthony Di-Loro, an early investor in the platform.

Finally, there’s bitcoin itself. Most of its phenomenal price gains in the last year have accrued as wealth to select holders of the coin, such as the Winklevoss twins. (See also: Winklevoss Twins Are Bitcoin's First Billionaires). According to information from bitcoinprivacy.info (cited by London-based research consultancy Capital Economics), just 5,500 addresses hold one-half of the current stock of bitcoin. Each of these addresses contains at least $5 million (based on bitcoin’s prices at that time), the firm stated in a January newsletter.

The luxury Italian sports car, Lamborghini, otherwise referred to as the “Lambo” has become a ‘holy grail’ for some cryptocurrency enthusiasts. As ridiculous as $200K+ automobile may sound to some individuals after bitcoin’s rise in 2017 that dream is now attainable for a lot of early adopters.

When Lambo?

A Lamborghini is an Italian automobile that can cost anywhere between $200,000 to $2,200,000 depending on the model. Over the past few months when many cryptocurrency enthusiasts were celebrating bitcoin’s meteoric rise, the topic of “Lambos” had become a hot conversation. Across social media forums and trading chat rooms many individuals often ask “when Lambo?” referring to the time when crypto-hodlers can all be able to purchase the luxury vehicle. At The North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, there were quite a few Lambos on site for everyone to drool over. Some even speculate that the rise of digital currencies had inadvertently pushed Audi/VW (the parent company of Lamborghini) public shares because of the crypto-madness last year.

One Bitcoiner Purchased a 2015 Lamborghini Huracan for $115

One dealership that sells luxury cars, Motorcars of Georgia, met a man last fall who purchased a 2015 Lamborghini Huracan with money he earned from a bitcoin investment. In fact, the $200,000 sportscar (45 BTC at the time) only cost Peter Saddington $115 dollars back in the early days. Saddington purchased his first bitcoins after he read about the currency’s first ‘crash’ from $30 to $3 per coin. Saddington reveals that he purchased the coins in 2011 for roughly $2.52 and won’t reveal to the media how many he owns. In addition to being an early adopter, Saddington also has his own YouTube channel and the video of him buying a Lambo from Motorcars went viral with over 1.5 million views.

Lambo Sales On the Rise Since the 2013 Bull Run

Saddington isn’t the only bitcoiner purchasing Lambos as the trend is being seen in a lot of other areas. The general manager at Lamborghini Newport Beach in Costa Mesa, California, Pietro Frigerio, says ever since bitcoin’s price spiked Lambo sales have followed the rise. Frigerio says throughout 2013 until 2016 the luxury auto dealer did 1-2 cryptocurrency transactions per month, but in December of 2017, Bitcoin’s recent peak, he sold over ten vehicles.

The love for Lambos has been infecting the crypto-community for quite some time as the first Lamborghini purchase with bitcoins took place in 2013. The same Newport Beach dealership sold a Lamborghini Gallardo for $209,000, or 216.8 bitcoins that year. If a cryptocurrency millionaire is lazy they can also purchase a Lamborghini Huracan LP-610-4 online from their couch. The green Huracan can be delivered ‘anonymously’ and is being sold by the White Company for BTC, ETH, and LTC.

Save Those Satoshis

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts saving their precious satoshis for a Lambo can also look at a special Lambo-centric price ticker that pairs a Lamborghini Aventador with the price of BTC. At the time of publication one BTC equals about 0.0214768460576 of a slice of one Lamborghini Aventador, according to Lambo/BTC Ticker’s statistics.

Jobs and applicants for employment in the cryptocurrency sector have increased substantially in India, despite current attitudes in Delhi towards bitcoin. Significant growth has been registered in the second half of last year, a period of great uncertainty about the crypto future of the country. This month Indian government reaffirmed its commitment to eliminate illicit use of cryptocurrencies. New regulations are expected in March.

Indians Searching “Crypto” on Job Sites

The number of cryptocurrency and blockchain related job postings has increased by 290 percent in the six months to November 2017. The trend was reported by the Indian branch of the global job site Indeed. During the same period, job searches with crypto related keywords also rose – by 52 percent.

Describing it as a promising and exciting new field of work, the Managing Director of Indeed India, Sashi Kumar, noted the sector was still in a very nascent stage. He said that the global market for blockchain related products and services is expected to reach $7.7 billion in 2022, Business Standard reported. The expert believes this is “indicative of even more jobs being created in the future”.

According to Indeed, India can look forward to a truly digital economy, despite Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s recent confirmation that cryptocurrencies are not a legal tender in country. His announcement came with the presentation of Budget 2018. The Indian crypto community had hoped for more clarity about taxation of cryptocurrency incomes, profits and transactions. Businesses willing to invest in mining and companies involved in trading have also asked for clear policy guidelines.

The Indian government has responded by forming a special committee expected to propose a regulatory framework after studying cryptocurrencies and their legal implications. New regulations should be presented by the end of March. They are likely to involve anti-money laundering procedures and measures to prevent tax evasion. Cryptocurrency exchanges in the country have already been targeted by financial authorities and institutions in regards to suspected dubious transactions.

According to media reports, 10% of bitcoin transactions in the world take place in India. As of September 2017, there were around 15 million blockchain wallet users worldwide, with 200,000 new accounts added each month, Indeed claims. An estimated 1.5 million of these users are based in India, their report says.

Global Jump in Crypto Jobs

The growth on the Indian crypto labor market is not an isolated case but rather part of a global trend. As news.Bitcoin.com reported, other employment websites have also announced that bitcoin-related jobs are booming. Freelancer.com reported 82 percent growth in the third quarter of 2017. The Australian company maintains a global platform connecting employers and freelancers.

A research by the UK-based freelance marketplace Peopleperhour.com revealed demand for experts in blockchain development, cryptocurrency and ICOs had soared by over 500% last year. According to the British platform, crypto freelancers can ask for as much as £215 per hour for their services. With 40 working hours a week their monthly earnings would exceed the annual return of most employees in the service industry, Engage Employee reported. Some of those crypto specialists can take an average UK salary with just 25 working hours a month.

""There's such an institutional appetite to get exposure to this,"" said Morehead, who is founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, a hedge fund and investment firm that works exclusively in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. ""It's a half-a-trillion-dollar asset class that nobody owns. That's a pretty wild circumstance.""

""And bitcoin is still so underowned by institutional investors that it trades at its own beat,"" he told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Thursday.

Pantera Capital was founded in 2003 and started its first cryptocurrency fund in 2013. It has since had returns of more than 22,000 percent, according to the Hedge Fund Research Indexes. In 2017, the firm launched an ICO, or initial coin offering, fund and a digital asset fund, receiving returns of 549 percent and 188 percent, respectively.

When bitcoin peaked in mid-December, trading around $19,500, the cryptofund was up 2,922 percent and collected more than $2 billion in assets under management. The firm was so successful that it had to raise fees to reduce inflows.

""We're certainly aware it's a very speculative market,"" said Morehead, who first bought bitcoin for $72 and watched the digital coins fall below $6,000 earlier this week. ""It's volatile on the upside. It can be volatile on the downside."" In December, he predicted the coins would fall by 50 percent before the next big surge.

Crypto prices slowly began to creep back up this week, trading above $8,000 on Thursday. Morehead said bitcoin's bottom may be here.

Bear markets, on average, have a 71-day run, Morehead pointed out.

After peaking at just over $20,000 at the end of last year, bitcoin has plummeted by about 57 percent to $8,400 today, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency’s market capitalisation now sits about about $143billion - a staggering $193.5billion less than its all time high. But bitcoin has been creeping back up over the past two days - already rising more than 17 percent on yesterday’s low. The CoinMarketCap live tracker below shows bitcoin’s price in real time.

Why is bitcoin rising today? It is thought that bitcoin’s rejuvenation has been sparked by increased confidence in the market. The cryptocurrency seems to have recovered from a spate of recent negative headlines and brushed off threats from governments that crypto trading could be banned or regulated. Cameron Winklevoss, CEO of Gemini Exchange, now predicts bitcoin will grow up to 40 times in value and become more valuable than gold. He told CNBC: “Taking bitcoin in isolation, putting all the other assets aside, we believe bitcoin disrupts gold.

“Bitcoin is actually fixed in supply so it's better than scarce and gold. It's more portable, it’s fungible, it's more durable.

Speaking to CNBC, he said: “Increasing regulatory recognition of cryptocurrency exchanges, the entrance of institutional capital and major technology developments will contribute to the market's rebound and push cryptocurrency prices to all new highs this year.”

Blockchain, smart contracts, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other forms of magical internet money are the hot topic of conversation in most tech circles these days. If you’re not reading about cryptocurrency in the news, or overhearing entrepreneurs pitch their ICOs in corner coffee shops, you may be chatting about them with friends and strangers on a messaging app.

You wouldn’t be alone, either. Cryptocurrency speculators, putative entrepreneurs hawking digital tokens, newly-minted enthusiasts, and the merely curious have flocked to messaging apps to chat about blockchain. And where the community chats about crypto, tokens miraculously appear to follow.

It’s a convergence that has caught our attention, and with help of experts, is worthy of an investigation.

The Curious Convergence Of Crypto & Chat Apps

Many of the world’s largest messaging platforms—the Whatsapps, iMessages, and Facebook Messengers of the world—haven’t made serious moves into the cryptocurrency space. Another tier-one messaging platform, WeChat, which has nearly a billion monthly active users primarily located in China, has cracked down on cryptocurrency trading groups as a consequence of Chinese government regulations.

Follow Crunchbase News on Twitter & Facebook

But some second-tier messaging platforms seem to embrace cryptocurrencies and the active, if somewhat hurly burly, communities around them. In this section, we briefly review cryptocurrency adoption by these platform providers.

Kik: An Early ICO

Kik, the Canadian mobile messaging company, was among the first VC-backed tech companies to raise money in an ICO. Before its ICO, Kik raised over $120 million in venture funding. In May 2017, Kik CEO Ted Livingston announced that the messaging platform would launch Kin, a token and medium of exchange for Kik users.

In August 2017, Kik raised 168,732 ETH in an ICO, then valued at around $48 million, plus an additional $50 million raised in a presale for three blockchain-focused venture funds: Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital, and Blockchain Capital. Although Kik raised a total of $98 million in its ICO, it fell short of its original goal of $125 million. Like many ICO’d tokens, Kin is an ERC20 token riding on the Ethereum blockchain.

Kin was issued at a price of $0.0001 USD apiece or 0.00000043 ETH. According to data from Coinmarketcap, at time of writing, Kin trades at 0.00000037, down fourteen percent from its issue price. Its USD-denominated price of $0.000309 may be more than three times higher, but that’s mostly due to ETH price appreciation.

Telegram: A Central Hub

These days, Telegram is in the news for a number of reasons, not all of which are positive.

Telegram is in the middle of raising one of the largest ICOs to date to fund the development of the Telegram Open Network (TON), a decentralized blockchain protocol and token for its 180 million users. It’s a little unclear just how much Telegram intends to raise through the offering. Crunchbase News has reported that the size of the offering ranges from $1.2 billion to as much as $5 billion. Investors like Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia are reported to be investing in the presale earmarked for investors.

In an update to previous reporting, Crunchbase News has learned Telegram aims to raise “around $2 billion, but that number keeps on changing,” according to a party involved in the transaction.

Telegram is also the primary messaging platform for organizing and hyping ICOs, some of which are legitimate (insofar as any ICO is legitimate), although many are blatant scams. As BuzzFeed News reported recently, Telegram is also home to many “pump and dump” groups. Members of these groups coordinate mass buys of thinly-traded tokens to boost the price only to sell these newly-inflated tokens as other market participants—who aren’t in on the scheme—unwittingly buy into tokens that appear to be gaining market traction.

Through the app, we reached out to Telegram’s press contact for comment. Despite being able to see that Telegram’s press read the message, Crunchbase News hasn’t received a reply.

Line & Kakao: Large Exchanges Emerge Alongside Messaging Apps

LINE Corporation, makers of the LINE messaging service popular in Japan, announced the formation of a new corporate subsidiary last week. According to the statement, LINE Financial Corporation (also known as LINE Financial) will be used “as a base” as its corporate parent makes “preparations to provide a variety of financial services, including a place to exchange and transact virtual currencies, loans, and insurance—all from the LINE app.” When the exchange service and other financial products will launch to LINE’s 200 million users is to be determined.

Joseph Young, a cryptocurrency analyst and writer, suggested on Twitter that LINE’s plan to launch a cryptocurrency exchange is a sign of growing competition in the space. Young posits that LINE’s announcement was a direct response to a South Korean competitor, a chat app called Kakao, which launched a cryptocurrency exchange called UpBit in partnership with U.S.-based exchange provider Bittrex LLC.

Blockchain-Native And Blockchain-Adjacent Messaging Protocols

In addition to these more centralized platforms that are just now dipping toes into choppy cryptocurrency markets, there are a number of blockchain-native and blockchain-adjacent messaging protocols. Privacy and peer-to-peer commerce appear to be the most common themes in the space.

Here’s the list:

Matrix is a decentralized communication protocol based on technology that’s “quite closely related” to blockchain but better optimized for real-time communications, Matthew Hodgson, Matrix’s founder, told Crunchbase News.

Whisper and PSS (Postal Service over Swarm) are two systems built on the Ethereum blockchain.

Dust, a decentralized chat app backed by Mark Cuban, launched the Mercury Protocol, also built on the Ethereum blockchain.

Air and Gliph are two peer-to-peer commerce platforms that use blockchain technology for transaction systems.

Sensay is an “AI-powered platform for chatbots” that recently announced a token to reward humans for content they contribute online.

Hush Messenger offers end-to-end encrypted messaging platform built on the zCash protocol.

Trends Of A Feather Come Together

So why are so many messaging platforms flocking to blockchain tech, and seemingly all at the same time?

We put that question to a number of people at organizations on all sides of this issue. Here’s who we heard back from:

Chris Coyne, cofounder of SparkNotes, OkCupid, and, most recently, Keybase. Keybase builds secure, end-to-end encrypted individual and team messaging services, an encrypted filesystem, and other cryptography software. Apart from a bitcoin brain wallet generator called Warp, Keybase doesn’t currently offer blockchain-based products or services.

Matthew Hodgson of Matrix, a decentralized communication platform. Matrix does not have a token, nor does it use blockchain-based payments in its platform.

A Kik spokesperson.

Through them, we identified a few key trends that drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology by chat applications.

A New Business Model

The ICO/token offering craze made it clear that, with a bit of PR, projects could raise a lot of money

Launching cryptocurrencies gives chat platform providers a way to build an economy, or at least facilitate economic transactions, inside their services. This creates a new business model, a way to fund development, and another vector for growth.

Matthew Hodgson explained that the reason why many chat platforms are launching tokens is because “it gives a way to monetise… as well as a way to reward users on the platform with tokens.” He also mentioned that attaching a financial value to tokens and requiring tokens to use the app “has potential to limit spam by requiring users to spend some funds before they speak to other users.”

Chris Coyne said that tokens offer a path to “easy fundraising.”

“The ICO/token offering craze made it clear that, with a bit of PR, projects could raise a lot of money,” Coyne told Crunchbase News. “A lot of hogwash promises have raised tens of millions of dollars. It’s no surprise messaging apps have jumped on this.”

Differentiation From Incumbents

A sea of sameness

In a mobile messaging market where some of the most significant players are eschewing cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, chat app makers on the lower rung of the MAU ladder see blockchain and cryptocurrency as a way to differentiate themselves.

Kik’s spokesperson said that the platform strived to innovate in the messaging space since the company’s launch, but “it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies in our space to continue to differentiate through innovation.” They explained that “intense competition and commoditization of product features and experiences” has created a somewhat stagnant market, which she colorfully characterized as “a sea of sameness.”

“The blockchain and related technologies [presented] an opportunity to create a fair and open ecosystem that preferences diverse participation and innovation,” said the spokesperson.

Kik completed its Kin ICO in the late summer of 2017 and rolled out the Kin product in December. A Kin Foundation blog post from mid-January 2018—roughly one month into the rollout—said that 68 percent of Kin users held their tokens, while another 32 percent chose to earn and spend them. The post reports that 18,000 transactions have occurred using Kin.

Trust In Trustless Systems

Modern messaging apps want to be secure

Blockchain technology can help a chat platform stay honest, so to speak, by removing the need for honesty. A user doesn’t need to trust a third party, like a bank or a chat platform provider, to be honest and transparent with them. Blockchains, by default, are typically transparent.

Matthew Hodgson told us that blockchain technologies “provide a decentralisation building block that can be used by chat platforms to spread freely on the internet and be run by the community rather than a centralised service.”

Chris Coyne also noted that blockchain tech helps with “transparent key lookups.” He explained that “modern messaging apps want to be secure” and that “secure conversations require trading public keys in some way.”

“Blockchain tech offers a level of transparency to show that a server isn’t lying. There are blatant lies to avoid, such as an evil server giving the wrong key for someone. And more subtle lies, such as a server lying by omission, when someone revokes a key,” Coyne explained. “Since cryptocurrencies are entirely public databases, it’s easy to see that everyone is getting the same answer for a key lookup.”

Coyne noted that Keybase works on a hybrid model that “doesn’t require running a full cryptocurrency node but achieves the same effects” as using a blockchain.

“We control writes to a database on our servers, but that database is entirely public and structured to prove all Keybase users are getting the same answers. […] If you look up someone’s keys on Keybase, you’ll see the same answer as anyone else using Keybase.”

He added that this hybrid, non-blockchain approach carries a bonus: “It’s fast.” And as Crunchbase News has covered in the past, this isn’t exactly the case with many blockchain systems.

Social Construction Of Value

There is one last trend that may be the most important. Chat platforms seem to be a natural medium for cryptocurrency transactions to take place and for communities to form.

“I believe the wallet of the future will require messaging built inside it. And the messengers of the future will allow sending money,” Coyne told Crunchbase News. “This product converge is natural, since people want to talk to the people they’re sending money to.”

The communal aspect of commerce is only part of the story, though. It’s also important to note that cryptocurrencies and other blockchain assets have financial value only because a lot of people seem to agree that they have value. So if the value of these assets is ultimately a social construct, it makes sense that, through chat platforms, people are able to construct that value socially.

The Message Is The Medium

Since shortly after the time bitcoin was released, blockchain technology has been something of a community affair. The communities that started on internet forums are now starting to move to chat applications, and many newcomers to the market don’t remember a time before they could chat about coins and tokens with friends through their phones.

A common refrain in the blockchain space is that “these are still the early days,” and insofar as that’s true, there’s no way to know how, or how quickly, the market for decentralized technologies will evolve. But there’s one thing for sure: more people are talking about it, and through messaging apps, it’s easier to do so than ever before.

Did you hear that bitcoin’s dead? Or how about the new coin that’s going to be the next ethereum? Also, there’s this cryptocurrency called verge that experts are tipping to make huge gains this year. And let’s not forget ripple either. You should totally load up on $3 ripple. Navigating the cryptocurrency landscape is tricky enough for experienced heads. But for the general public, who take their news from traditional media outlets, the situation is far worse. Hopelessly misinformed reporting and PR puff pieces published as ‘news’ have left the public more clueless than ever.

Sowing the Seeds of Crypto Confusion

As bitcoin reached record highs in December, the mainstream coverage grew to a crescendo. Suddenly everyone from mom to the metaphorical shoeshine boy had an opinion on cryptocurrency as the masses wired their deposits to Coinbase to get some skin in the game. When the markets started to fall in January, these new adopters got burned the worst. Many were stunned to see their rapidly diminishing portfolios, and a number quit altogether, electing to sell at a loss rather than endure more financial agony.

Mainstream media aren’t to blame for the price of bitcoin, and can be forgiven for getting swept up in the crypto mania that was unavoidable for a while. Reporting on the news is their job after all, and for a while the news was “Everyone’s buying bitcoin and it keeps going up”. What’s less forgivable is the recklessness of much of the reporting. Established outlets such as the New York Times, Bloomberg, and Reuters, while not perfect, have the resources to provide proper coverage of the crypto space. But less reputable rags have also piled in, and their breathless reporting is often woeful.

Crypto Gibberish from the Tabloid Press

In the UK, three mainstream publications have excelled themselves when it comes to clueless crypto coverage – the Mail Online, Sky News, and the Express. In one article this week, detailing bitcoin’s slide, the Express featured related ads and articles that urged readers not to buy ethereum, to buy ripple, to look into a bitcoin pension and to learn more about bitcoin ‘skyrocketing’ 25% in 24 hours. Is it any wonder that casual readers have no idea what’s actually happening? The same ads aren’t unique to mainstream media sites either – Coindesk has also come into criticism for hosting similar clickbait ads alongside its news stories.

Even if the contradictory ads are overlooked, the quality of reporting from outlets such as the Express is hopelessly misinformed:

This is the same publication that recently claimed ripple to be a mineable cryptocurrency. This week, Sky News also published – as straight news – a press release for a new ICO headed by notorious British businesswoman Michelle Mone. The Scottish lingerie entrepreneur has a string of failed ventures and dubious business practises to her name, but there was no mention of that in the story, which has since been deleted, but is still available as a cached version. Titled “I hope my new cryptocurrency encourages women to invest in tech”, it bears the strapline “Baroness Michelle Mone launches cryptocurrency Equi which will allow the public to invest in tech start-ups”.

Whatever her ICO may be, it has nothing do with helping women. The piece is riddled with preposterous claims that crypto heads would see through instantly, but that could easily hoodwink newcomers including the women the project is supposedly designed for.

Accurately reporting on the cryptocurrency space requires journalists with the requisite knowledge and expertise. Otherwise, not only are these platforms misleading their readers – they’re potentially defrauding them. While the ‘fake news’ meme has caused the public to be more sceptical of the information they’re fed, the majority still presume that if a story’s on an established site, it must be true. If media outlets can’t tell the difference between vaporware and legitimate cryptocurrencies, and don’t understand things such as market cap and total circulating supply, they should refrain from dispensing investment advice or enlist reporters who can.

Arizona may become the first U.S. state to legalize bitcoin as a payment option for tax purposes. Bills to that end have been advancing in the State Legislature, with one of them already passed by the Senate Finance Committee. First reading of a draft law regulating ICOs has been scheduled, too. The Grand Canyon State is sending a signal to everyone that it will be “the place to be” for cryptocurrency.

Sending a Signal

Several bills that recognize bitcoin and other cryptos as currencies have been making their way in the Arizona State Legislature. Two of them, SB1091 and SB1145, will regulate income tax payments with cryptocurrency. One of them has already passed the Senate Finance Committee in mid-January. Another bill (HB2601) is expected to regulate crowdfunding and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Its first reading in the House of Representatives is scheduled for June 2, and a second reading will take place a month later.

“We are sending a signal to everyone in the United States, and possibly throughout the world, that Arizona is going to be the place to be for blockchain and digital currency technology in the future,” Representative Jeff Weninger (R) told Fox News. He believes that in the next 5 to 10 years crypto technology will change the world the way the internet did.

The income tax legislation he co-sponsored passed the Finance Committee with a 4-3 vote in mid-January. Weninger insists that the new law will make it easier for people to pay their taxes, without opening their “normal wallets”. “Being able to do it in the middle of the night, being able to do it at home, while watching TV… I think in a few years this isn’t even going to be a question”, he said.

Pros and Cons

According to a study by the University of Cambridge, the number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets may be up to 5.8 million. Phoenix businessman Jack Biltis, who is one of them, believes this is the way of the future. He told Fox:

We actually allow employees to receive their paycheck through bitcoin and even invest part of their 401k in bitcoin.

Biltis, who has a payroll company, is convinced that the new crypto technology will replace “what we have now with the inefficient credit cards and banking systems”. Cheap and instantaneous money transfers are possible with cryptocurrency, he noted. Jack Biltis wants Arizona to be a state that encourages these technologies.

Others are not so sure about the idea to pay taxes with crypto. Arizona State Senate Minority Leader Steve Farley (D) thinks that all taxpayers will be put at risk because of the volatile nature of bitcoin. He warns that if the new legislation is passed the state will be responsible for exchanging the cryptos. Farley claims that “certain special interests get advantage” with such amendments to the tax code and “the rest of us… get screwed”. In his opinion, taxpayers should pay only in fiat currency:

American dollars are good enough for me. They should be good enough for anybody else who pays taxes.

“It’s always a little scary and thrilling at the beginning. It was with the Internet”, business owner Jack Biltis says, however. “The world is going to look so different in 20 years”, he adds, “and the people that are going to be truly successful are those that embrace it now”.

Primus Inter Pares

Most U.S. states have yet to adopt comprehensive legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies but several have taken positive steps. These include Kansas and Tennessee, where authorities have issued memorandums indicating that money transmitter licenses will not be required to sell digital coins. According to Bitcoin Market Journal, the situation is similar in Texas, where bitcoin companies are not licensed when running a custodial exchange for in-state customers.

Montana has no money transmission laws and there is no indication that bitcoin regulations will be imposed in the future. In June New Hampshire Governor John Sununu signed a bill that exempted anyone who uses “virtual currency” from registering, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. The state effectively deregulated bitcoin after previous legislation had targeted cryptocurrencies with tougher regulations.

If adopted, the law to legalize cryptocurrency payments for taxes in Arizona will be country’s first. A similar legislation was voted down in New Hampshire two years ago with concerns like those expressed by the Senate Minority Leader in Phoenix. State Representative Eric Schleien (R), who introduced the NH bill, explained there would be no cost and no risk to the state, as conversion to dollars would be automatic to eliminate concerns about crypto volatility. If Arizona lawmakers approve the proposed amendments, the Grand Canyon State may start collecting taxes in bitcoin within two years.

Russia’s largest bank, the state-controlled Sberbank, has reiterated that it is not mining cryptocurrencies. However, the bank says that it has often caught its employees crypto mining using the bank’s equipment.

Sberbank Claims It’s Not Mining Crypto

The state-controlled Sberbank is the largest bank in Russia and the third largest in Europe. The bank is in possession of a large quantity of graphics cards that can be used for cryptocurrency mining. The bank’s senior vice president, Alexander Vedyakhin, apologized publicly in November of last year for causing a shortage of these cards in the Russian market, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

Since admitting to scooping up most of the graphics cards on the domestic market, Sberbank has maintained that it is not mining cryptocurrencies with them. Instead, Vedyakhin claimed these cards are for the bank’s “laboratory for the development of artificial intelligence,” Tass quoted him.

On Wednesday, Chairman of the bank’s Board, Herman Gref, reiterated at the “Leaders of Russia” forum that Sberbank is not mining cryptocurrencies on a corporate level. However, the publication quoted him proclaiming:

We bought [graphics] cards of a slightly different configuration. Sberbank is not engaged in mining, but we often catch employees who are engaged in mining on the bank’s equipment.

Gref elaborated that he believes the bank is not interested in mining because it is a “primitive business,” adding that “I can tell you a dozen other investment objects with higher yields,” RBC detailed.

Sberbank’s Engagement with Cryptocurrencies

At the end of January, Sberbank announced that its subsidiary in Switzerland will start offering cryptocurrency trading. This Swiss part of the plan is to “avoid violating domestic rules,” Reuters explained. Meanwhile, Russian regulators are working on finalizing the legal framework for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

In addition, the bank opened a blockchain laboratory last month for researching the latest technology in this area. “The laboratory will cooperate with start-ups, associations and various communities,” RBC conveyed, adding that the bank will introduce “educational programs in this area.”

Gref also recently stated that he “opposes the ban on cryptocurrency and calls for tolerance and patience in their regulation,” Tass described and quoted him saying:

Before trying to regulate, you do not need to rush, but you do need to maintain a normal background around the technologies of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

What is bitcoin cash? Bitcoin cash (BCH) was established in August 2017 as a hard fork of bitcoin - the world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency. Created by miners after disagreements within the bitcoin community over limiting the number of transactions, bitcoin cash aims to provide a fast, cheap way of sending money across the globe. The crypto’s website reads: “Bitcoin cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as ‘peer-to-peer electronic cash’.

“Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. “The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralised development.” While bitcoin cash is a lot like its parent crypto, there are a number of key differences. These include an increased block size and no SegWit integration - the controversial upgrade that was added to bitcoin to enable more transactions to be processed.

Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, who is often described as the ‘Bitcoin Jesus', is confident bitcoin cash is more “usable” than bitcoin.

Bitcoin cash has all the characteristics that attracted me to bitcoin in the first place Roger Ver, Bitcoin.com CEO

Speaking to CNBC, Mr Ver said: “Bitcoin cash has all the characteristics that attracted me to bitcoin in the first place. “And those characteristics are it’s fast, it’s cheap to use and reliable. And bitcoin core and their development team have intentionally made bitcoin more slow, expensive to use and unreliable. “So if you have two versions of bitcoin: one that’s fast cheap and reliable and one that’s slow, expensive to use and unreliable, you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out which one of those two versions of bitcoin will be most usable. And it’s clearly bitcoin cash.”

COIN MARKET CAP Bitcoin Cash price: BCH has surged in value over the past six months

COIN MARKET CAP Bitcoin price chart: The cryptocurrency has bounced back this week",2018-02-09 16:24:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/indias-tax-department-is-sending-notices-to-crypto-investors,"An Indian tax official has said that gains from cryptocurrency investment are subject to tax liability and that it will seek those trying to avoid paying up.

During an event on Tuesday this week, Sushil Chandra, chairman of India’s Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT) confirmed that around 100,000 notices have been sent to residents who have not included their cryptocurrency investment on income tax returns.

According to Chandra, the notices were sent by the department’s law enforcement units across the country to ensure cryptocurrency investors are aware of their tax liabilities.

Chandra said:

“People who have made investments [in cryptocurrencies] and have not declared income while filing taxes and have not paid tax on the profit earned by investing, we are sending them notices as we feel that it is all taxable.”

The latest statement from India’s tax department comes as confirmation to a previous report saying that tax notices were sent to investors after a nationwide survey has discovered some $3.5 billion-worth of cryptocurrency being traded in a 17-month period.

According to Chandra, his agency has conducted several surveys on domestic exchanges in an effort to gather information about regular traders, including “how many people are regular contributors, how many have registered themselves and how many have done trading.”

Based on the surveys’ results, the agency said investors that were sent notices had failed to properly and clearly disclose the holding of their cryptocurrency investment.

Case in point: Governments, which are moving to regulate blockchain technology and the cryptocurrencies it underpins.

Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin that live in open networks, have so far inhabited a regulatory gray area, because there's no way for a central authority to track users. The distributed ledgers, however, are useful because they can enable cross-border transactions over peer-to-peer networks in real time, anywhere in the world – without a central governing authority such as a bank or credit card company.

In recent months, however, the U.S., China and other countries have begun to adopt a more hands-on regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies.

One reason for regulating blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, also known as digital tokens, is the growing concern that the virtual money they represent could be used for nefarious activities, such as money laundering. Cryptocurrencies could also be a threat to the current financial system because they have at times encouraged unbridled speculation and unsecured borrowing by consumers looking for a piece of the crypot action.

""We have seen increasing evidence that people are borrowing to invest in cryptocurrencies, and in some cases borrowing on credit cards to invest in it,"" said Martha Bennett, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. ""That could lead to a credit collapse.""

Last year, China outright banned initial coin offerings, a form of crowdfunding for cryptocurrencies, and later put the kibosh on trading in electronic currencies. More recently, the government began shutting off the power faucet for bitcoin mining pools, the large server farms that perform cryptocurrency processing.

In the U.S., various state agencies have also reacted to what they see as fraudulent activities by cryptocurrency companies by ordering them to cease sales of bitcoin. One Nebraska lawmaker filed three bills to amend the state's money-laundering laws to cover cryptocurrencies and, more broadly, blockchain applications.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ordered the suspension of cryptocurrency trading by one company due to ""unusual and unexplained market activity."" More generally, SEC regulators around the country have regularly tweeted out warnings about cryptocurrencies.

Governments move from oversight to acceptance

""They've been pretty emphatic,"" said Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger, a collaborative formed to create blockchain technology for business use. ""They're talking about third-party cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and the 1,300 other cryptocurrencies out there. But they're not talking about blockchain technology. They're still extremely bullish on that.

""They're pushing hard, as many countries are, for using distributed ledgers - using blockchain - to implement their own domestic digital token,"" Behlendorf added.

While blockchain is the foundation for cryptocurrency, it is not anchored to digital currencies. Blockchain distributed ledgers are used for a myriad of business applications, such as authenticating real estate transfers or for digitizing supply chains or tracking international shipments in real time.

Maersk A blockchain-based, distributed electronic ledger could save the shipping industry billions of dollars a year by replacing a current EDI and paper-based system for tracking cargo and attaining approval from customs and port authorities.

A government-backed, blockchain-based digital token would offer the benefits of an international currency usable for settlement of global trade and holdings. And it would be one with lower fees because it would require less administration through the use of smart or self-executing contracts.

[ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ]

In order to be viable, a state-issued digital token would need the backing of the government itself or a central bank, such as the U.S. Central Bank, Bank of England, or Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example. Such cryptocurrencies, so called ""stablecoin,"" are tied directly to a country's fiat money or backed by a commodity, such as gold.

For example, OneGram is a gold-backed cryptocurrency that backs each digital coin with a gram of gold. Each transaction of OneGram Coin (OGC) generates a small transaction fee which is reinvested in more gold (net of admin costs), thus increasing the amount of gold that backs each OneGram, according to a white paper.

The U.K's Royal Mint has begun selling cryptocurrency tokens against bars of gold, and has even called its Royal Mint Gold, ""The New Digital Gold Standard.""

""I know central banks in lots of places are looking at this. We may eventually see central banks issue bonds against cryptocurrencies backed by their status as a tier one bank,"" Behlendorf said.

Fiat-digital tokens are not bitcoin

The original idea behind bitcoin was to create a decentralized electronic currency for everyday purchases; however, it has rapidly become a speculative asset, with a value that's been volatile in recent months – sometimes reaching nearly $20,000 in value, only to plummet below $10,000.

""Bitcoin was born amid eroding public trust in financial institutions and governments with the goal of circumventing currency control by any centralized power and simplifying online transactions by cutting out intermediaries,"" said Csilla Zsigri, a senior analyst at 451 Research.

""The bitcoin and cryptocurrency frenzy forced governments to take a closer look at what they mean for the future of trade, finance, their role and that of central banks in the economy of the future,"" Zsigri continued. ""The U.S., China, Japan, Russia and other governments are all exploring [or] actively working on digital currencies.""

In a blog, ""Fedcoin: On the Desirability of a Government Cryptocurrency,"" David Andolfatto, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, argued that government-backed cryptocurrencies would provide greater transaction transparency.

And the head of the People's Bank of China's (PBoC) new Digital Currency Research Institute wants that nation's central bank to create a cryptocurrency, which he claimed would provide stability to China's fiat money.

Consumers would use crypto or encrypted electronic wallets to store money that could then be used on an electronic ledger and transferred as it's spent to a merchant's account, according to a PBoC research paper.

Other cryptocurrency trial runs include:

While digital tokens could be issued on any distributed ledger, central banks could also choose to run their own private or permissioned ledgers to track the cryptocurrenc and ensure conformance to ""know-your-customer"" (KYC) or anti-money laundering regulations, according to Behlendorf. A permissioned blockchain ledger enables central control over who is allowed to transact, and it can require certain forms of identification that can then be associated with an anonymous hash.

For nearly two decades, KYC regulations have emerged to prevent financial services firms from being used to launder money, or to take ill-gotten gains and funnel them through third parties in order to give them the appearance of legitimate assets.

While banks and governments could create fiat-style cryptocurrencies, they would still be at a distinct disadvantage to bitcoin and other third-party tokens that can move between hands but aren't required to conform to KYC or anti-money laundering rules, Behlendorf said.

Zsigri agreed: ""A state-backed digital currency system would be less costly and have fewer intermediaries than our current system, and could ultimately save people money and time. However, it would be centralized and would suffer all the disadvantages of centralized systems.""",,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cardsloans/article-5363217/Can-claim-cryptocurrency-losses-Section-75.html,"A number of credit card providers have put blocks on customers buying cryptocurrencies on plastic in recent weeks.

Lloyds – which also owns MBNA – became the latest to ban these transactions this week, explaining that it took the measure to 'protect' its clients.

The move came as bitcoin crashed from an all-time high of $20,000 in December to below $6,000 on Tuesday.

However, it has denied to This is Money claims it took the step after a glut of customers contacting providers attempting to claim on Section 75, a piece of consumer protection available on credit card purchases over £100.

Lloyds ban: The bank said Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and MBNA credit card customers could no longer buy cryptocurrencies on plastic

This is Money put the question to Lloyds after claims emerged alleging credit card providers had been deluged with refund requests from customers who had lost out when their holdings plummeted in value.

Website CryptoGo claimed that some customers had become aware that 'using credit cards to pay for crypto transactions were insured for purchases'.

The website adds that it believes: 'Banks' credit card protection for purchases helps customers get a full refund but with so many wild card tactics out there, they were set to lose billions.'

It said: 'Credit card payment protection is completely free and comes automatically with every credit card – meaning the banks felt they were on dodgy ground, word spread like wild fire and it was enforced across the city like lightening.'

Furthermore, on social media website Twitter, an investor Kevin Allen claims: 'Exchanges selling crypto as an investment informed individuals using exchanges knowing if their ""investment"" loses they can claim false misrepresentation.

'These people are smart, knowing S75 gives them a one way bet.'

Bitcoin boom: The price is volatile and some may have seen heavy losses, if they bought into the digital currency in mid-December.

We put the claims about Section 75 to Lloyds Banking Group.

We asked if a customer could attempt a Section 75 claimback for cryptocurrency and whether there had been a large number of attempts to do so.

We also asked whether a customer, who went to buy bitcoin with a credit card on a dodgy website, could use Section 75 if they are defrauded or do not receive the crypto in question.

A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman told This is Money: 'A Section 75 claim makes the credit card company jointly liable for any breach of contract or misrepresentation by the retailer or trader.

'Unless that breach of contract was apparent therefore, a Section 75 claim wouldn't be possible for a consumer who had purchased a cryptocurrency.'

The banking giant said it has seen some credit card customers call about using Section 75 for crypto buys, but the coverage is not applicable if someone has bought into a digital currency and it has simply fallen in value.

BITCOIN PRICE The price of bitcoin has yo-yo'd this week. It hit a weekly high of $9,400 on 3 February, before falling as low as $5,900 on 6 February, data from Coindesk shows. Today, it sits at $8,200, still way below the peak of nearly $20,000 reached on 16 December. This kind of volatility may be what is worrying credit card providers.

It says the rise in calls about it hasn't been huge, unlike the claims made above.

It says coverage is not applicable because cryptocurrency is likely to have been bought and received as promised - and thus, it is not covered.

However, for those who have been defrauded by entering details on a dodgy website or didn't receive the digital currency they were trying to buy as promised, they will look into the 'nuances' of the case.

It might not be Section 75 that is used, it says, but something else to help a customer get their money back.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Bitcoin, the most familiar of the digital currencies, has bounced back to $8,200 today.

These swings are potentially making credit card providers nervous.

Capital One had already made the same move a month previous, while Virgin Money said it was doing something similar in the wake of the Lloyds announcement.

Furthermore, in the US, a number of others have blocked credit card crypto buys, including the Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan.

Some other British based banks have also said they are keeping an eye on the situation, including Santander.

While those that have blocked buys say it is protect customers, there are other transactions which similarly can lose money – the most obvious example is gambling on sporting events, lotteries or at casinos.

Credit card transactions are not typically blocked for this type of activity - although many charge extra to do so, typically a three per cent fee.

For example, Halifax started charging a £3 fee to credit card customers who play the Lotto in the summer of 2016, as it treats it as gambling. It varies from provider to provider.

The argument could be made with cryptocurrencies that people are lumping speculative investments onto a credit card, lose heavily and then not have the means to pay it back.

But again, this already happens with a whole range of purchases, from white goods to holidays.

Given the ban has only been put on credit card purchases - not debit card, or bank transfers, providers may be worried about the stronger consumer protection credit cards offer.

On purchases on a credit card of more than £100, under Section 75 the provider of credit is equally liable with the provider of goods or services in cases where there has been misrepresentation or a breach of contract.

It removes the risk that people could be put into debt for goods or services that weren't received at all, were faulty, or were otherwise not as described.

Now this is interesting because consumers, stung by cryptocurrency problems, may theoretically have a case – but it is a grey area, given the sudden boom in crypto interest.

Put simply, most credit card providers do not have crypto buys written into their terms and conditions.

It something goes wrong with a purchase, the responsibility of reimbursing a consumer with the loss is with both the retailer who sold the goods or services.

Many crypto exchanges are based abroad – but Section 75 also applies to foreign transactions and goods bought online.

Credit card providers could potentially be on the hook if a cryptocurrency exchange went bust or a customer is defrauded by a phony website.

In terms of huge losses, a consumer could argue that wherever they bought their digital currency from 'misrepresented' the investment in question – but we reckon that would be much tougher to prove.",2018-02-09 10:18:14+00:00

Bitgrail, an exchange whose primary purpose was to facilitate the trading of nano, has folded after ‘losing’ 17 million XRB, valued at around $170 million. The Italian exchange had been offline for weeks, and its customers feared the worst. Today, its operator “Francesco The Bomber” confirmed the bad news, which gained short shrift from the Nano community. Many believe Bitgrail’s owner to have exit scammed, taking with him almost 13% of the total circulating supply.

A Big Heist for Tiny Nano

Up until December of last year, nano – then going under the name of raiblocks – was little more than another aspiring altcoin hoping to make it to the big league. Its promise of fast transactions and zero fees had some of the more diligent Twitter traders interested, but even they were astonished by the moon mission XRB suddenly embarked on. At the start of December, 1 XRB could be bought for $0.20. One month later, 1 XRB had soared to $35 after gaining 17,500%, making it 2017’s biggest gainer and putting the likes of bitcoin, litecoin and ripple in the shade.

For most of last year, Bitgrail – the ‘rai’ in its name derived from raiblocks – was one of the only places where XRB could be bought. The exchange was clunky and erratic, like most small crypto exchanges, but it worked. Most of the time. It also supported other cryptocurrencies, but the volume was laughably low. Bitgrail was the place to go for raiblocks and nothing else. 99% of the time, altcoins that begin life on micro-exchanges stay there. But every once in a while, an outlier makes it to the big league. Raiblocks did just that in December, gravitating to larger exchanges and rocketing in price.

Bitgrail, previously just another minnow in a sea of competing exchanges, suddenly found itself in the custody of assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The temptation to take the money and run may have been too much for the site’s operator to take. It’s unclear at this stage exactly what happened. On January 28, the exchange tweeted: “XRB deposits and withdrawals currently suspended for internal system optimization. Thanks for understanding.” Then, on February 9, it posted the following notice:

Hack or Exit Scam?

While many users are adamant that Bitgrail has exit scammed, Francesco maintains the site was hacked. It has been alleged that the stolen XRB has been gradually transferred from this Bitgrail wallet to Mercatox and getting dumped for months. There are also rumors that Bitgrail became insolvent following a withdrawal bug that was discovered by some users and then shared in Discord and other chat groups, causing the wallet balance to gradually diminish. One user explained: “There was a bug on Bitgrail where if you placed two orders you got double balance added to your account. You could then withdraw while the orders were up and steal the coins. You had negative balance in the end but you could just make a new account.”

In a statement published on February 9, the Nano team wrote: “We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time.” Whatever the truth, Bitgrail users have zero chance of getting their crypto back.

It’s a suckerpunch for hodlers who’d had the acuity to buy raiblocks when it was dirt cheap and had then seen their little turned into a lot. By mid-December they should have taken their coins off Bitgrail and into a personal wallet, or at least to a more reputable exchange, but that’s easy to say in hindsight. The Nano team have sensibly refused Bitgrail’s entreaties to alter its code to isolate the stolen XRB.

Only a week ago, Binance added nano to its exchange. In the wake of the Bitgrail incident, Binance’s CEO tweeted “We are in contact with Nano team (re: Bitgrail) and will freeze deposits from identified addresses as we receive them. This is one reason we require coin CEO/founder to submit listing requests. Binance will assist where we can. We need to work together to protect users.” In monetary terms, the $170 million hack is less than half the previous record, set just a fortnight ago, when $400 million of NEM were stolen from Coincheck. But at 12.7% of the total supply, the XRB theft is bigger than NEM and bigger than the the 800,000 BTC that caused the collapse of Mt Gox.

With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies finally bouncing back after a steep correction to start the new year, finance ministers in France and Germany are looking to shut down the party by calling for a crypto crackdown.

France and Germany ‘Threatened’ by Cryptocurrency

French and German finance ministers continue to call for strict regulation on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

According to reports, French Finance Minister Bruno le Maire and interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier signed a letter to fellow G20 finance ministers, in which they claim cryptocurrencies are not only risky for investors but also threaten long-term global financial stability. They write:

Given the fast increase in the capitalization of tokens and the emergence of new financial instruments … these developments should be closely monitored.

They also claim that cryptocurrencies “are currently largely mislabeled as ‘currencies’ in the media and on the internet,” creating a “lack of clarity” which “can only fuel speculation.”

The finance ministers additionally claim to be the good guys, looking out for newbie cryptocurrency investors who aren’t quite sure what they’re getting themselves into, writing:

… the buildup of individual exposures to such volatile tokens could have damaging consequences for misinformed investors who do not understand the risks they are exposing themselves to.

Of course, these sentiments can easily be interpreted as authorities from traditional financial institutions feeling the mounting pressure from a rapidly increasing and ever more popular cryptocurrency market, which very much aims to disrupt traditional financial structures.

FUD, FUD, and More FUD

Finance Minister Bruno le Maire and interim German Finance Minister Peter Altmaier are not alone in expressing fears over Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Other individuals from traditional financial institutions are also voicing their concerns.

European Central Bank board member Yves Mersch expressed his negative opinion on Thursday, stating that cryptocurrencies are “not money, nor will they be for the foreseeable future.”

Additionally, Bank for International Settlements head Agustin Carstens expressed his deep-rooted fears, begging central banks to shut down Bitcoin—claiming cryptocurrencies are “piggybacking” on established institutions and becoming a “threat to financial stability,” stating:

[Bitcoin is] a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.

Now that’s some serious FUD.

What do you make of French and German finance ministers calling for a global cryptocurrency crackdown? Does this worry from mainstream financial institutions signal their growing fear of Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below!

Not only are big banks looking at the applications of bitcoin and the blockchain technology attached to it, so too are they worrying about the impact the volatility could have on their customers.

This is particularly true when it comes to people using credit cards to speculate on bitcoin.

Although there is only anecdotal evidence of this, there is believed to be a growing number of people maxing out their credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies in the hope that their price will appreciate.

Banks are concerned that wild swings in cryptocurrency prices will expose their customers to heavy losses, making them unable to repay their credit card debts.

As such, some lenders have barred their customers from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, with American banks JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup leading the way. A number of UK banks have now followed suit, but which ones?

The famed hub of American 1960s radicalism and counterculture, Berkeley, California is at it again. Dormant for a few years, the US presidency of Donald Trump has awoken defiant spirits, as the city challenges administration policy over everything from immigration to taxation. One tool of resistance under consideration is an initial coin offering in creation of the city’s very own token.

Also read: Landmark Senate Crypto Hearing Seen as Mostly Positive by Bitcoiners

In Defiance of Trump Admin, Berkeley Considers Its Own Cryptocurrency

Berkeley city council member Ben Bartlett stressed, “Berkeley is the center of the resistance, and for the resistance to work, it must have a coin.” The resistance he spoke of has to do with the Trump administration, and its singling out of the local university over campus speech issues, along with threatening to defund Sanctuary Cities which decriminalize illegal immigrants, of which Berkeley is considered a leader.

The coin would be floated as a kind of municipal bond at first, targeted through an initial coin offering (ICO) aimed at funding housing for the city’s homeless. Mr. Bartlett continued, “You’re looking at a disaster. We thought we’d pull together the experts and find a way to finance [affordable housing] ourselves.”

Fear of immigration crackdowns, a reconstituted tax bill the city worries will impact it negatively, Mr. Bartlett has managed to get the city’s mayor on board the ICO idea. The city will partner with Neighborly and its UC Berkeley Blockchain Lab to push the project forward with a possible rollout by May. “Unlike most of the ICOs which deliver coins for a future value or service, these coins will represent a real security issued for a specific purpose,” Neighborly’s COO Kiran Jain explained.

A local token is seen, beyond housing concerns, as a hedge against Trump administration actions as a whole, Mr. Bartlett said. The city fully expects its budget to be impacted by federal cuts simply due to Berkeley’s role in openly fighting Mr. Trump’s policies on so many levels.

Match Made in Heaven

If ever two things were meant for one another, it’s cryptocurrency and Berkeley, California. Known for its radical political leanings since the 1960s, it is home to experiments in all kinds of living. For progressive communities like it, the federal government has been a political apparatus they wish to capture and put to use. In areas such as Civil Rights, for example, blanket, robust federal enforcement was seen as ideal to make sure citizens were protected from Pacific to Atlantic.

Other political philosophies warned how empowering the federal or national government to overwhelm local communities for the greater good, even in the service of racial equality, was a dangerous bargain. What would be to stop it from doing the same in the opposite direction should it begin to enforce a national or federal policy those in Berkeley didn’t admire?

The United States prior to early 1960s federal legislation in this regard practiced something known as states rights: the ability for states to effectively nullify federal overreach. States rights and nullification during the 1960s were considered code to protect racists who desired to keep ethnic minorities as second-class citizens. And the federal government was employed several times to enforce social engineering schemes from desegregation of public schools through busing to making sure business commercial arrangements were also race neutral.

The national government could wield this power through the purse. Oh, your state or locality doesn’t want to obey our latest mandate? Great. No federal funding for education, for roads, for this or that, and some of these subsidies were quite substantial. Communities were arm-twisted to accept federal standards not just on the Civil Rights front, but from environmental concerns to even automobile speed limits. And since nullification and states rights, enshrined in the country’s last amendment in the Bill of Rights, went out of vogue, locals became resigned to their fate.

Present day political realities unearthed nullification and states rights without calling it that. Stoners, potheads, heshers, and sexual minorities found those tools, and set about statewide referendums. Their successes are undeniable. Hardly anyone bats an eye at gay married couples anymore, and more states each election cycle are either decriminalizing recreational marijuana or legalizing it altogether. The City of Berkeley is another battle on the nullification front, and crypto could be its killer app.

The addition of tokenization could very well signal another way around more odious federal dictums, and at least one other major US state is said to be flirting with the idea.

Some of the most popular people in the world have used their money, celebrity, and immense social media followings to invest in or endorse cryptocurrency-based businesses and services.

A lot of the celebrity support for cryptocurrencies revolves around the Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) the cryptocurrency startups create. An ICO is a fundraising event where a cryptocurrency sells a percentage of that currency, in the form of tokens, to people in exchange for money to help get the cryptocurrency off the ground. A few words of praise from certain celebrities have helped numerous cryptocurrencies earn millions of dollars in funding.

Actors, musicians, athletes, and entrepreneurs have all been drawn to the allure of cryptocurrencies. These are some of the most notable celebrity endorsements.

50 Cent No rapper has benefited from the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies like 50 Cent. In an effort to stay current with how his fans purchase music, 50 Cent accepted bitcoin purchases of his 2014 album Animal Ambition. He received 700 bitcoins, which were valued at $660 each, at the time, and admits he forgot about the stash. Once each bitcoin’s value exploded in 2017 to a record high of $19,850 in mid-December, his forgotten stash rose in value to as high as nearly $14 million. When 50 celebrated his new fortune in January, the value had dropped to $10,000 per bitcoin, enough for a nearly $8 million haul.

Nas Nas was a celebrity endorsing cryptocurrency before it became a fad. He invested in bitcoin digital wallet Coinbase in early 2014. Months later in a August 2014 interview, Nas proclaimed that bitcoin had the potential to be “as big, if not bigger, than the Internet.” A few months later, the Illmatic rapper informed his millions of fans on Facebook that he would be rewarding bitcoins to those with the highest scores on his Nas trivia contest at The Rap Test website. At the time of the August 2014 interview, the legendary lyricist claimed he and his team had been collecting bitcoins for over a year, when the price of a bitcoin hovered between $100-$1,000. At the time of press, each bitcoin is worth roughly $8,000, which would net the multi-millionaire rapper a hefty sum of money if he kept a large enough number of bitcoins in his stash.

Richard Branson Richard Branson, the Virgin Group founder trying to make commercial space flights a reality, rarely does anything less than epic. His love of cryptocurrency is no different. He invested $30 million into bitcoin startup Bitpay in 2014. Before that, he announced he would accept bitcoins as a form of payment for tickets on his upcoming commercial space travel service Virgin Galactic, in late 2013. Branson received six bitcoin purchases for tickets only a few months after that announcement. Later in 2014, the multi-billionaire voiced his immense satisfaction in Bitcoin’s future in a September 2014 interview. His cryptocurrency support hasn’t wavered over the years, with Branson investing in bitcoin service provider Blockchain last year.

Ashton Kutcher The That 70s Show star has had a complicated, but profitable relationship with technology over the last decade. He portrayed Steve Jobs in a film, and was an early investor in Airbnb and Uber. One of his early hits was in cryptocurrency, and it’s starting to pay off. Kutcher is one of the earliest celebrities to the cryptocurrency craze, tweeting about Ethereum in May 2014, more than a year before its initial release in July 2015. Ethereum is now one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world, with one Ethereum valued at more than $830, at the time of press. Kutcher also invested in Bitcoin processing service Bitbay, and regularly updates his 19 million Twitter followers about the latest Bitcoin news.

Katy Perry Back in November 2017, Katy Perry shared with her more than 68 million Instagram followers how she got some cryptocurrency advice from one of the best people to get any financial advice from: Warren Buffett. It wasn’t long after her meeting with Buffett that Perry became a cryptocurrency supporter. In January, she posted on Instagram what may be the prettiest advertisement for cryptocurrency to date, embroidering her nails with the logos of five cryptocurrencies. Tweeting about how much you love bitcoin is one thing. Decorating your nails with the logos of five of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world is a different level of crypto dedication.

Floyd Mayweather Floyd Mayweather is synonymous with two things – money, and winning. Now, he may be one of the most active celebrity endorsers in the cryptocurrency market. In July 2017, Mayweather endorsed the ICO for blockchain prediction platform Stox.com. A month later in August 2017, the undefeated pugilist promoted the ICO for a blockchain-based content marketplace known as Hubii Network. Then, in September 2017, Mayweather signed on to being the brand ambassador for cryptocurrency platform Centra. Mayweather’s endorsement is as good as his right jab, with Centra raising more than $30 million weeks after Mayweather’s endorsement. No wonder the revered boxer has referred to himself as “Crypto Mayweather.”

DJ Khaled DJ Khaled’s greatest talent is promotion. He can make any mundane meetings feel like the Super Bowl with his boisterous personality and grandiose descriptions of everything. Just like Mayweather, Khaled used his social media promotional prowess to endorse the potential of cryptocurrency platform Centra. In September 2017, Khaled bragged to his more than 12 million followers on Twitter and Instagram about having a “titanium centra debit card” from Centra. A month later in October 2017, he posted a video on his Instagram page showing off the features of Centra Wallet app on his iPhone, a few weeks after the app hit the Apple Store.

Mike Tyson Unlike most celebrities whose cryptocurrency endorsements don’t extend beyond a few social media posts, Tyson tied Bitcoin directly to his brand. In late 2015, Tyson partnered with Bitcoin Direct to release Bitcoin ATMs branded with the fighter’s ferocious image. Months later in January 2016, Tyson and Bitcoin Direct announced the former heavyweight champ would get his own digital Bitcoin wallet where people can buy and exchange cryptocurrency directly form the app.",2018-02-10 21:00:21+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/law-legalize-crypto-mining-introduced-armenia/,"Law to Legalize Crypto Mining Introduced in Armenia

Armenia may soon follow in the footsteps of countries like Belarus in regards to crypto regulation. Newly proposed legislation provides the basis for legalizing and regulating cryptocurrency mining in the country. Tax exemptions and other incentives will be offered to miners. If the draft law is adopted, businesses will be able to operate mining facilities without any licensing. This will indirectly legalize cryptocurrency transactions.

Time to Move with the Times

The bill to regulate the mining of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin has been introduced in the parliament in Yerevan. If Armenian lawmakers vote for the new legislation, their country will become the second member-state of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) to demonstrate positive attitude towards the crypto sector. Belarus has already taken steps in that direction legalizing cryptocurrencies, regulating ICOs, and exempting miners from taxation.

The proposed amendments are quite liberal. Every private individual and corporate entity in Armenia would be allowed to set up facilities and start mining, Eurasia Daily reports. No special permits or licenses will be required. The draft exempts miners from taxation until December 31, 2023, and that incentive is retroactive. Mining companies may enjoy other benefits like preferential customs tariffs.

Behind the initiative to legalize cryptocurrency mining is Edmon Marukyan, member of the parliamentary minority, who says he was motivated by “the need to move with the times”. Despite his affiliation with the opposition, Marukyan may succeed in pushing through his Law “On Digital Technologies”, as there have been some positive developments in the same direction throughout the whole region.

Armenia’s neighbor Georgia is a real pioneer in crypto legalization among countries in the South Caucasus. The implementation of blockchain technologies there has been expanding for several years, in both the private and the public sector. The first bitcoin mining farm in Transcaucasia was set up in Georgia, and since 2016 the country’s land register has been maintained on a blockchain.

Eurasian Winds of Changes

The Armenian government has its doubts about the expediency of crypto legalization and Yerevan has already shared its concerns. The Central Bank came out with a statement warning against the use of bitcoin before it is regulated. “According to the law, virtual currencies are not electronic money”, the bank said three years ago. It promised to study the “emission and circulation” of cryptos and user protection practices. The ubiquitous “absence of clear international approach” was also mentioned.

According to experts quoted by Eurasia Daily, Armenian authorities are wary because they realize that current control mechanisms are insufficient. The weakness of government institutions and the proximity to conflict zones increase the risk of cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing.

It seems, however, that Armenia is shaking off its cryptophobia. Recently, a government think-tank made proposals to place different state registers on a blockchain. Plans to create a free economic zone for startups developing distributed ledger applications were announced in January.

Winds of change are blowing in Eurasia and warming up the crypto climate across the Eurasian Economic Union. The leader in cryptocurrency adoption, Belarus, is preparing to legalize the whole spectrum of bitcoin-related activities. The presidential decree about cryptos, ICOs and smart contracts will come into force by the end of March.

In Russia, the Finance Ministry has already published the draft law “On Digital Financial Assets”. Despite its reservations towards cryptocurrencies, the Central Bank has signaled it would not mind the legalization of crypto mining and coin offerings. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev recently stressed the need to synchronize efforts with the other EAEU countries and called for a common approach to cryptocurrency regulation. Kazakhstan, where government leaders met last week, and Kyrgyzstan, which is also a member-state, have taken steps to appear on the global crypto map.

After spending months searching for the perfect ""playboy's playground"", many of those that struck lucky are selling up and heading for the capital San Juan.

Convinced that blockchain — the technology that underpins the notorious bitcoin — could reinvent society, they hope to create a new city where all the money will be virtual.

At first they planned to call it “Puertopia”, but after hearing that means “eternal boy playground” in Latin, they may change the name to Sol.

The group is headed by Brock Pierce, the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, and co-founder of the start-up block.one, who has around £5 BILLION worth of the virtual currency EOS.

Mr Pierce, 37, a former child actor and professional gamer, landed in Puerto Rico in December and insists the group has grand intentions.

“I’m worried people are going to misinterpret our actions,” Mr Pierce said. “That we’re just coming to Puerto Rico to dodge taxes.”

Together those hatching the plan will take over hotels and even a museum, and have been discussing whether to buy the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, which has an adjacent airport.

On Saturday, February 10 a new bitcoin cash (BCH) wallet was announced called, Handcash, an SPV client that enables Near Field Communication transactions. The wallet’s initial release is still in beta form but is available to download for experimentation on all compatible Android devices.

Disclaimer: On November 15, 2018, the Bitcoin Cash chain bifurcated into two chains. There is now a network called – Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV) – and the company/wallet/infrastructure provider mentioned in this editorial has chosen to support the BSV chain. Sending Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to a BSV wallet/address or vice versa can lead to financial losses.

Handcash the NFC Bitcoin Cash Wallet

A team of developers launched a new wallet called Handcash; a bitcoin cash client for Android phones. At the moment the platform is still in its beta form but the wallet focuses on ease of use and has a few unique features. One aspect is the wallet’s ability to complete Near Field Communication (NFC) payments in a matter of seconds. The feature effectively resembles handing someone some cash, hence the name ‘Handcash’ says the wallet developers. Anyone can make in-person payments with NFC without having to ask for a specific address or QR code.

“NFC Payments: seriously, you gotta try this out with someone. It’s so cool to do a BCH transaction with anyone in a couple of seconds without having to ask for an address. It’s effectively just like handing cash,” explains the Handcash creators.

‘Cashtag’ Usernames and Encrypted Backups

In addition to the NFC functionality, the wallet has a unique system for addresses because one element allows the use of usernames instead. The feature is called ‘cashtags’ and the developer says they are not linked to any certain address but they are linked to your phone’s ID. This means when a user sends bitcoin cash to another Handcash user the wallet’s system creates a new address for every transaction.

Further, the wallet’s developers detail the Android client has a one-tap wallet backup feature which is also different than the standard 12-word backup phrase. The team has developed a method that encrypts a wallets backup file and it stores both private key information and the rights to a ‘cashtag’ username in a Google Drive folder.

“So if you were using the google account you already are logged into on your phone — If you change your phone, you can recover your wallet on the first screen once you reinstall Handcash again,” explains a Handcash team member.

Beta Testing Until the App Works Properly

Handcash is still in beta and before the wallet jumps on the bitcoin cash mainnet the developers want to make sure the app works properly. However, a ‘Handcashbot’ distributes testnet BCH for users to test and experiment with certain features like NFC transactions. The beta version also does not encrypt the wallet username and encryption will be added when the 1.0 Handcash version goes live. Additionally, the developers conclude that the Cashaddress format is ready for mainnet once the app leaves beta.

India will soon have its own rules on bitcoin. The responsibilities of various regulators have been determined, a high-ranking official revealed. Relevant institutions are currently finalizing a comprehensive government policy on cryptocurrencies. Representatives of the Indian crypto community, meanwhile, have quashed fears of an imminent ban.

Crypto Policy Being Framed

The roles of various regulators in regards to cryptocurrencies have been decided already, the Chairman of India’s Securities and Exchange Board told reporters on Saturday. Amid continuing volatility on the markets and growing concerns about investors’ protection, Ajay Tyagi said the expected regulations should be out soon, the New Indian Express reported. He declined to provide further details, insisting officials would do that after the comprehensive government policy is finalized and announced.

Tyagi’s comments come after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presented Budget 2018 this month. While explaining its key policies, Jaitley reiterated a previously stated position: Cryptocurrency is not recognized as legal tender in India and the government “will take all measures to eliminate“ its use in financing illegitimate activities. Indian authorities will instead encourage blockchain technology in payment systems, he said in his budget speech on February 1.

SEBI has asked the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) to call a meeting on regulation matters on the next day, the Board’s chairman revealed. Ajay Tyagi was obviously referring to the panel set up to propose a regulatory framework after examining cryptocurrencies and their implications. “We have actually decided which regulator will do what and the committee should come out with the regulations very quickly”, he added. Tyagi promised his agency “will fully contribute to this” objective and insisted, “We want a policy to be framed first”.

Back in December the Finance Ministry announced it was creating a special panel to follow developments, including the volume of bitcoin related trade, and help speed up the process of adopting crypto regulation. Representatives of DEA, the Reserve Bank of India, and the Income Tax Department were invited to join the committee.

Suspense in India, but no Fear

According to previous media reports, new regulations were expected by the end of March. They are likely to involve anti-money laundering procedures and measures to prevent tax evasion. Suspecting dubious transactions, authorities have targeted cryptocurrency exchanges in the country and banks have suspended some of their accounts. More recently, India’s Income Tax Department announced it had issued notices to 100,000 cryptocurrency investors after monitoring the operations of leading trading platforms.

The Indian crypto community expected more clarity from Budget 2018 in regards to taxation of cryptocurrency incomes, profits and transactions. Mining and trading companies have also asked for clear policy guidelines from the government. Minister Jaitley’s reaffirmed position, however, did not answer many of the outstanding questions. Some see an imminent threat of an outright ban of bitcoin in his vow to “eliminate” cryptocurrencies. Others point out that he actually meant their use for illicit purposes.

Ajeet Khurana, head of India’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee (BACC) recently said he was happy that cryptos were mentioned in the state budget. “Having the finance minister say that cryptocurrency is not legal tender is perfectly logical. Every nation, barring Japan, has taken this stance. It doesn’t mean crypto trading is illegal, but that it comes with its own risks like any other investment asset in the market”, Khurana explained, quoted by Forbes. “There are multiple dimensions to bitcoin – technology, security, privacy. It is important to be aware of every aspect, to understand bitcoin better and make informed decisions while trading,” Khurana added.

Sandeep Goenka, cofounder of one of the biggest crypto exchanges in India, Zebpay, believes that the current government is open-minded and says this is a welcome change for those developing revolutionary technology. “The ideal way to strengthen the system is by using approved banking channels to onboard new customers and legitimize bitcoin trading”, he stated. Goenka also noted that the major exchanges in country are already implementing such measures and they should be a standard practice.

In the absence of official statistics, there have been several attempts to gauge the Indian crypto market. Ajeet Khurana says there are at least five million active traders in India that use existing regulated banking channels. One in every 10 bitcoin transactions in the world takes place in India, according to Constantin Papadimitriou, president of Pundi X. The Indonesian company conducted a survey in six countries, which discovered Indians were quite optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies. The Indian branch of the job site Indeed claimed in a report that as of September last year there were 1.5 million wallet users in India. The number of crypto-related job postings on its platform has increased by 290 percent in just six months.

The Indian crypto sector definitely looks “too big to fail” now. Both the government in Delhi and the Indian crypto community seem to realize that fact. That, surely, is the main takeaway from all this.

You might think you need an extreme know-how of computers to do any kind of crypto mining, that it couldn't possibly be done by the average person.

Turns out, it's absurdly easy.

You just need computer parts that are powerful enough to make mining profitable, and a handy piece of software called Nicehash. You literally press a green button on Nicehash to start mining.

I've been experimenting with crypto mining on Nicehash myself, and it's been a fun little project. I'm not raking in a huge amount of cash, as my mining rig is small enough that it's more like looking for change on a sidewalk. Bigger mining organizations have warehouses full of powerful computer parts that can generate a ton of cryptocurrencies.

And at the end of the day, I'd only really suggest it if you already have a gaming PC with an appropriately powerful graphics card – the key component for mining. And you need to make sure your electricity costs aren't too high, as mining can suck up a ton of energy.

DMM’s Mining Farm in Japan

DMM Inc, the operator of popular e-commerce site DMM.com with 27 million members, announced on Friday the launch of its mining farm in Kanazawa City, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. The company stated:

DMM operates large-scale ‘Japan-quality’ mining farms that are unparalleled in scale compared to other domestic operators…By establishing a mining farm in the cold district, we realize low price electricity procurement and maximize mining revenue.

In addition, the company revealed that its mining farm “has also been turned into an open showroom for our customers to access.” The showroom will display 1,000 mining rigs. “We are aiming to open this showroom from the beginning of March,” DMM wrote, adding that “we plan to start acceptance from the middle of March for tours for the general public.”

Following the launch in Japan, the company plans to deploy additional mining farms overseas. “By starting domestically, DMM’s engineering team is directly involved in the operation to secure quality and win the trust of domestic users,” Fuji Television Network described.

DMM’s Mining Rigs

DMM has installed in its mining farm both types of mining rigs, ASIC and GPU, allowing the company to mine many different types of cryptocurrencies. DMM’s “ASIC machines purchased [were] made in China,” the TV station noted. “The ASIC machines are 650 MH/s (mega hash/sec), and the GPU machines are about 300 MH/s or less.”

The news outlet further noted that “the power consumption is 750W for ASIC and 1900 to 2000W for GPU,” adding that the GPU mining rigs have twelve GPU cards connected to two power supplies.

DMM says it will mine several types of coins, including bitcoin, ether, and litecoin. “We are not particular about bitcoins,” the leader of the DMM mining laboratory Shinichi Takaguchi told Fuji TV, but emphasized that “Of course we are also mining bitcoins” alongside other coins. Depending on the market environment, he reiterated that the lab will mine all the cryptocurrencies that are most profitable at the time, adding that:

In the future, we plan to start managing our own DMM [mining] pool, and plan to develop cloud mining that allows general users to purchase mining rights around summer.

DMM has also recently launched its own cryptocurrency exchange, supporting 7 different cryptocurrencies and 14 trading pairs, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

CySEC Requires Brokers to Divulge Operational Geography

The Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) announced a major change to its regulatory confinements last Thursday. The new law requests that all CySEC regulated brokers are now required to send the regulator a letter, fully listing all countries from which each company is currently or intends to provide its services.

The requirement further specifies that additional licensing or permission must be obtained from each country of operation, and that verification must be supplied to CySEC, in order to prove that the services are permitted in that region.

Brokers who have expanded beyond the EU, in an effort to onboard more clients, will now have to either receive and relay the official permission of local regulators, or opt to stop offering services in their respective regions.

India Crypto Regulation

Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, said last week that the government of India is set to place regulations on cryptocurrencies by March 31. It appears that the main focus of regulations will address the lack of tracking that currently encompasses the industry, and their vulnerability to money laundering, and potential terror funding as well.

Indian regulators have voiced concerns over the current way in which exchanges are set up, unregulated or monitored, and provide an easy path toward money laundering. An underlying issue is the fact the transactions cannot be tracked, thereby opening the door for fraudulent activity.

China Cracks Down

The Chinese government highlighted several marquee events last week. First, the government announced its intentions to block access to all cryptocurrency websites from within China.

The government had already banned crypto exchanges and ICOs in 2017, but it appears that many investors are able to bypass the ban, through access to foreign website, from within Chinese mainland.

This promoted the government to reach the decision to block all crypto-related website. In response, practically the entire crypto market was in the red, as tremendous losses were incurred by many of the leading cryptocurrencies.

Moreover, the FX market did not completely evade the government’s backlash. Due to mounting pressures from Chinese authorities, the country’s search engine Baidu, has officially banned FX ads. As part of its efforts, Baidu has linked FX keywords to a disclaimer, that now informs users to seek “legal alternatives to leveraged FX trading.”

Growing Concerns over Tether

Convers over the legitimacy of Tether continue to mount, amid a recently collapsing cryptocurrency space, and a consequent flood of funds out of the market. The struggles incurred by crypto investors since the start of the year, has led many to wonder just how stable the US tether cryptocurrency really is.

As more investors begin to withdraw funds from the market, it has brought to question the true amount of US dollar reserves available to the company at any given time.

Aldo contributing to public concerns is the evidence of a (too) close relationship between Tether and the crypto exchange Bitfinex. In response to a hack on the exchange that saw $31 million in Tether Dollars stolen from investors, the US CFTC issued a subpoena to both Bitfinex and Tether, further elevating suspicions over both entities.

Moreover, the fact that it has been more than year since Tether has issued any transparent information or offered an audit of any kind, is the icing on the cake that has cause the chaotic whispers across the crypto industry.",2018-02-11 13:14:24+00:00,https://money.cnn.com/2018/02/11/investing/lagarde-bitcoin-regulation/index.html,"International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde says it's only a matter of time before cryptocurrencies come under government regulation.

""It's inevitable,"" she told CNNMoney emerging markets editor John Defterios. ""It's clearly a domain where we need international regulation and proper supervision.""

""There is probably quite a bit of dark activity [in cryptocurrencies],"" she added at the World Government Summit in Dubai on Sunday.

Lagarde said that the IMF is actively trying to prevent digital currencies from being used to launder money or finance terrorism. But she argued that regulators need to focus less on entities, and more on activities -- who is doing what, and whether they're properly licensed and supervised.

Digital currencies have largely operated in a regulatory vacuum since bitcoin's debut in 2009. But governments and central banks are starting to pay closer attention, warning investors about potential scams.

In December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation started to crack down on alleged fraud in fundraising by some cryptocurrency companies and traders.

In Asia, where cryptocurrency is particularly popular, China and South Korea have both cracked down on cryptocurrency trading. Concerns about new restrictions, and rumors over a potential ban in India, have fueled volatility in digital currency prices.

Top government officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos also signaled that more regulation could be on its way.

Some headlines have claimed that bitcoin mining worldwide uses more electricity than all of Denmark or Ireland, while others argue that such figures are inflated. Now figures from an energy firm in Iceland provide some context. In 2018, HS Orka estimates that Icelandic data centers mining cryptocurrencies will use 840 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity—more than what the country’s entire population consumes in the same year to power their homes.

“What we’re seeing now is…you can almost call it exponential growth, I think, in the [energy] consumption of data centers,” Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, an HS Orka spokesman, told the BBC. Iceland’s population of 340,000 people use roughly 700 GWh of electricity in their homes per year.

Both cryptocurrency mining and Iceland’s homes use a comparatively small amount of the total electricity the country generates. In 2015, Iceland generated about 18,700 GWh electricity in a year. Most of that energy is used for industrial purposes, such as aluminum smelting or metal-alloy production.

Yet Sigurbergsson says of the demand for cryptocurrency data centers: ”If all these projects are realized, we won’t have enough energy for it.” That’s because it’s not easy to rapidly build new data-mining power plants.

Building out bitcoin-mining operations in Iceland is greener than doing it in China. Almost all of Iceland’s electricity is generated from renewable sources—about 70% from hydro power, and the rest from geothermal energy.

That hasn’t stopped Icelandic politicians from sounding the alarms about the potential consequences of cryptocurrency mining on its environment. “Hydro plants change aquatic ecosystems. Geothermal plants cool surrounding ground. Small negatives compared to, say, coal, but still not neutral,” Smári McCarthy of the Pirate Party wrote on Twitter. “Cryptocurrency mining requires almost no staff, very little in capital investments, and mostly leaves no taxes either. The value to Iceland…is virtually zero.”

In an earlier interview with AP, McCarthy suggested that cryptocurrency miners should be taxed. Then, fearing a backlash, he backtracked, saying he’d like to work with the companies to “strengthen innovation” so that “everybody can benefit.”",,https://www.coindesk.com/uk-government-websites-hit-by-cryptocurrency-mining-malware,"U.K. government websites and more than 4,000 others worldwide have reportedly been exploited by malware that harnesses visitors’ computers to mine cryptocurrency.

According to BBC, the incident was first revealed after British security researcher Scott Helme, who raised the alarm that users browsing the website of the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) are affected by the malware, dubbed Coinhive, which illicitly mines the anonymous cryptocurrency Monero.

The ICO subsequently closed its website when the issue was revealed, the report indicates. At press time, the site was still down, citing “maintenance.”

The BBC said the malware spread after having compromised a website plug-in service named Browsealoud, which is used to help blind or partially sighted users access website content.

According to the report, the maker of the plug-in, Texthelp, confirmed that its product was breached for four hours by the mining malware. Helme said the malware had now been disabled.

In addition to the ICO website, the report said other British sites are also affected, including the Student Loans Company and Barnsley Hospital, as well as thousands of others worldwide.

According to another report from Australian news source ABC.net, several government sites in Queensland, as well as the Victorian Parliament, also appeared to have been affected.

According to a November 2017 report, Coinhive has become the sixth most common form of malware. It has previously been discovered in Google ads, the Ultimate Fighting Championship website and TV network Showtime, among many others.

Thousands of websites around the world, including many operated by governments, have been infected by hackers using the sites' computing power to ""mine"" cryptocurrencies, security researchers said.

The attack is the first major incident made public in which a new breed of hackers took over a large numbers of websites to effectively create currencies like bitcoin which are generated by using computing power.

The attacks made public over the weekend by British security researcher Scott Helme showed more than 4,000 website were infected in this manner, including those of the British data protection and privacy watchdog and the US federal courts system.

Unlike traditional attacks, these infections do not contain ""ransomware"" or steal data, but operate in stealth mode to make profits from the shadowy world of cryptocurrencies.

Helme said in a blog post Sunday that the hackers were able to reach large numbers of websites by infecting a commonly used ""plug-in,"" or software which helps a site run better.

In this case, the hackers used the malicious software to create Monero, one of several new cryptocurrencies which are making a splash in financial markets.

""If you want to load a crypto miner on 1,000+ websites you don't attack 1,000+ websites, you attack the 1 website that they all load content from,"" he said.

The creator of the plug-in, the British software firm TextHelp, said it took the affected software offline after it discovered the ""attempt to illegally generate cryptocurrency. ""

""This was a criminal act and a thorough investigation is currently underway,"" the company said in a statement.

Researchers have been warning in recent weeks about this kind of malware, which can deliver profits without being obvious to users.

Security researchers at Cisco Talos warned last month that this kind of hacking activity ""has exponentially increased.""

Because of the huge financial gains in cryptocurrencies, Cisco researchers said this has become a prime target for hackers.

""At a high level mining is simply using system resources to solve large mathematical calculations which result in some amount of cryptocurrency being awarded to the solvers,"" Cisco researchers wrote in a research note.

Security researcher Graham Cluley said the latest attack highlights vulnerabilities in websites which may have weaknesses in third party components.

""Things could have been much worse,"" Cluley said in a blog post. ""Imagine if the plug-in had been tampered with to steal login passwords rather than steal CPU resources from visiting computers.""

He said 4% of all criminal proceeds are now turned into cryptocurrencies.

P olice have limited means of disrupting crypto transactions, unlike those using traditional finance.

Law enforcement across the board is worried about untraceable transactions.



Criminals in Europe are using cryptocurrencies to launder as much as $5.5 billion (£4 billion) in illegal money, according to the head of Europe's policing agency.

Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, estimated that around 4% of all criminal proceeds in Europe are being funnelled through currencies like Bitcoin — and he expects this figure to increase.

Europol's standing estimate for the amount of illicit cash circulating in Europe is around £100 billion, Wainwright said. Using his 4% estimate for the amount funnelled via cryptocurrency gives a figure of £4 billion, or $5.5 billion.

In an interview with the BBC, Wainwright said police find it harder to stop illicit cryptocurrency transfers because they have no way to freeze crypto wallets in the way they could freeze a bank account.

He said: ""They [cryptocurrencies] are not banks and governed by a central authority so the police cannot monitor those transactions. And if they do identify them as criminal they have no way to freeze the assets unlike in the regular banking system.""

He called on the operators of cryptocurrency exchanges to do more to cooperate with police investigations and ""develop a better sense of responsibility.""

Law enforcement officials across the board are increasingly concerned about the use of cryptocurrency by organised criminals.

Last week a drug dealer trader in Wales was convicted to eight years in prison for running a dark web fentanyl store which traded entirely in bitcoin.

London's Metropolitan Police briefed Business Insider and other outlets on the issue last November, and said even low-level drug dealers were using crypto, via a network of physical ATMs.

Bitcoin appears to be the most frequently used currency because of its higher profile. But officials have also voiced concerns about other currencies, like monero, which go to even greater lengths to conceal the identities of those trading in them.",2018-02-12,https://www.cnet.com/news/blockchain-explained-builds-trust-when-you-need-it-most/,"This is part of ""Blockchain Decoded,"" a series looking at the impact of blockchain, bitcoin and cryptocurrency on our lives.

These days, we're having a harder and harder time trusting each other.

Trust is an essential part of ordinary living, whether it's picking mechanics based on Yelp reviews, sliding credit cards into gas station fuel pumps or heeding our doctor's advice. But our trust has been eroding for years. In the US, only 33 percent of us felt we could trust our government in 2017 -- a decline of 14 percentage points from 2016, according to Edelman's annual trust barometer study. Trust in businesses dropped from 58 percent to 48 percent, too, while media (fake news!) and social networks also took a hit.

That's a problem. The less trust you have, the harder everything becomes. Did that job candidate really graduate from college? Did your brother-in-law really repay that loan?

But there's an unlikely solution that might help restore enough faith in strangers to make our lives a bit easier: an encryption technology called blockchain.

Blockchain is best known as the technology behind the cryptocurrency bitcoin -- a digital currency whose value soared above $19,000 over the last year before slumping to half that when the frenzy subsided. But blockchain is so much more, potentially easing the doubts and uncertainties that dog so much of life -- whether buying a used car from a stranger, having faith that a piece of fruit really is organic or knowing that a prescription drug isn't counterfeit. Blockchain, in effect, hard-wires trust into transactions or data that we might otherwise be more cautious about.

""It's revolutionary,"" said Mark Siegel, an investor at Menlo Ventures.

Now playing: Watch this: What the heck is blockchain?

Bitcoin's value has soared and plunged over the last year, and it's hard to separate the sensible from the scams among the 1,500 other cryptocurrencies. But blockchain has enjoyed more stable appeal.

Indeed, staid companies like IBM, Microsoft and Intel are offering blockchain as just another software tool to get business done. Other companies dabbling in blockchain include Goldman Sachs, Nasdaq, Walmart and Visa.

Because blockchains work as a secure digital ledger, a bumper crop of startups are hoping to bring it to voting, lotteries, ID cards and identity verification, graphics rendering, welfare payments, job hunting and insurance payments.

A lot of that revolution could be invisible to you, taking place inside and among businesses. But it's potentially a very big deal. Analyst firm Gartner estimates that blockchain will provide $176 billion in value to businesses by 2025 and a whopping $3.1 trillion by 2030.

How does blockchain actually work?

OK, strap yourself in, because this gets a bit hairy.

A good place to start is the name: a blockchain is an ever-growing set of data blocks. Each block records a collection of transactions -- for example, that you now hold the title to the car you bought or that you paid a car dealer to get it.

Maersk

That may sound simple, but here's a difference between blockchain and the Department of Motor Vehicles. Today, the government stores the information on its own central computer. Blockchains, though, distribute it across a group of computers -- maybe even thousands of them. Each has its own copy of the blockchain transactions.

That decentralization and synchronization means no single party controls the data. If one business sells an asset to another, each sees the same data. There's no need for lawyers at one company to call the other if their accounting databases disagree, because there's only one accounting database.

Cryptography -- mathematical methods of keeping data secret and proving identity -- now enters the picture when it comes to recording transactions. Blockchain uses the same cryptographic key technology that keeps hackers from sniffing your credit card number when you type it into an e-commerce website. One digital key ensures only you can enter a transaction to the blockchain involving your assets, and another digital key lets someone else confirm it really was you who added the transaction.

""You can take a network of parties that didn't have prior experience working with each other -- that didn't have reason for trust -- and still find a way to build a transaction record or a history of the truth,"" said Brian Behlendorf, executive director for the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger project for blockchain software.

Indelible ink

Another fundamental part of the blockchain is called immutability -- its resistance to tampering or other changes. To understand it, you need to understand another cryptographic concept called the hash.

Hashing reduces data to a bunch of seemingly random characters -- for example, the hash of the phrase ""the quick brown fox"" is ""9ECB36561341D18EB65484E833EFEA61EDC74B84CF5E6AE1B81C63533E25FC8F"" using an encoding method called SHA-256. Tweaking just one letter in the phrase produces a completely different hash, and you can't go backward to figure out the original data from the hash.

With blockchain, hashes are linked together so any minute change is immediately visible, not just for the block housing it but for all other blocks added later. With red flags that big for changes that small, you can see why auditors would get excited.

""It's like doing the crossword puzzle in ink instead of pencil,"" said Marie Wieck, head of IBM's 1,500-employee blockchain group. ""You will see if you change your answer to 3 across from moon to star.""

That's no fun for embezzlers accustomed to hiding behind dodgy or altered records. Cryptocurrencies can offer anonymity to criminals, which is why it's been popular for things like the WannaCry ransomware that locked up people's computers until they paid up. But blockchain makes it easier to find the digital scene of the crime -- especially with private blockchains that networks of business partners can set up to cooperate.

Mining madness

The process for locking down a block onto the blockchain so it can't be changed, at least today, is called mining.

And it's a problem.

Here's how it works. When you and others announce transactions to a blockchain network, computers on that network race to solve a complicated mathematical puzzle based on those transactions. A computer that succeeds announces it to the network, and the transaction is accepted if other computers verify that none of the assets in question were already used. That's what'll keep you from selling the same concert ticket twice on a blockchain-based ticket market. (Citizen Ticket and Active Ticketing are working on this.)

Bitmain

But today's mining approach, called ""proof of work,"" has huge drawbacks.

For one thing, mining works most profitably on powerful computers that consume immense amounts of electrical power. For example, bitcoin mining today uses about as much power as the country of Singapore, enough to power 4.4 million houses, according to cryptocurrency analyst firm Digiconomist. That amount is growing.

For another, transactions are relatively slow. Blockchain transactions can race past transactions that rely on middlemen and reconciliation procedures, like escrow accounts for home purchases or international money transfers. But bitcoin transactions can take about 10 minutes, which is why cryptocurrencies today aren't useful for just buying something in a store.

There's lots of work to free blockchain from the problems of transaction speed and energy consumption, though. One idea, ""proof of stake,"" uses no significant computing power and looks to be the future for the Ethereum Project, which is responsible for the ether cryptocurrency.

If bitcoin was the first generation of blockchain and Ethereum the second, there are a number of people hoping their project will catch on as the third.

Tezos, for example, hopes to build in better governance so its technology can move forward without the troubles bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered, said Tezos CEO Kathleen Breitman, speaking at the Techonomy conference in November -- though ironically, Tezos has suffered governance problems of its own with a spat over its own management. Another challenger is Dfinity. Its chief scientist, Dominic Williams, promises transaction speeds 600 times faster than Ethereum, which today is only a bit faster than bitcoin.

Smart contracts

The original blockchain was described in a 2008 bitcoin paper by Satashi Nakamoto, a pseudonym for a person or perhaps group that unified some ideas into the first working cryptocurrency. The idea became reality with the release of open-source bitcoin software in 2009. The bitcoin blockchain now records about 300 million transactions and counting.

But ether has popularized a newer idea called smart contracts. These are programs that run on the Ethereum network and take automated if-this-then-that actions. For example, a smart contract could look for the highest bid in an auction at a certain time and automatically transfer ownership rights to the auction winner.

Enlarge Image Yahoo Finance

""When companies sign a contract, it's enforced by a judge or lawyers in a court,"" said Vipul Goyal, an associate professor in Carnegie Mellon University's cryptography group. ""Smart contracts are enforced by cryptographic mechanisms in the code. Enforcing the contract is much cheaper and much faster -- almost instant.""

With smart contracts, blockchain could help automate lots of computing operations, including ones humans never touch. Your electric car could wait for favorable electricity prices before deciding when to charge itself from the grid, solar panels or in-home batteries, then the blockchain could handle accounting among all the parties.

Goyal expects blockchain will help automate all sorts of transactions. For example, if it's used to register your car purchase, that could trigger a cascade of other operations, like transferring the car's cryptographic keys that let its owner unlock the car.

""This is much more efficient than going to the DMV and filling out paperwork,"" he said. ""It's also more secure, because these keys cannot be forged. The seller can't make copies of the key and try to steal the car.""

The ties that bind

Expect to see blockchain showing up in particular where there are groups of interlinked organizations. That could include one company and its suppliers, or it could be consortiums of competitors and and their suppliers.

For example, IBM has a blockchain partnership with a long list of food suppliers and grocery retailers, including Dole, Kroger, Nestlé, Tyson Foods and Walmart.

Brave Software

Another blockchain project comes through browser startup Brave, which relies on the technology to change online advertising in a way that improves performance and privacy while giving browser users a cut of the proceeds. Blockchain accounting, using a digital payment mechanism called the basic attention token (BAT), enables direct payments among advertisers, publishers and browser users -- for example an advertiser paying a publisher or a reader making a small one-off payment for a news article without buying a subscription.

It's transparent, so anyone can see exactly how many BATs were transferred and check that Brave didn't illicitly siphon any off, Brave CEO Brendan Eich said.

But for companies averse to sharing data with competitors, blockchain's transparency is a difficulty. There are mechanisms for handling the challenge, Behlendorf said.

""In most networks, you have a balance between data that can be kept private, but enough public that you can attest to its veracity,"" Behlendorf said.

Another way blockchain could bring many parties together is property records.

There are thousands of counties in the US, each with its own record of who owns what. One startup, Propy, hopes to digitize those records, mirroring the records initially the way title companies do, but also storing them on the blockchain, said CEO Natalia Karayaneva.

If county clerks saw the benefit, they could gradually move to the system -- it's decentralized, not Propy's own database. Propy hopes to profit by taking a percentage of the sales it facilitates, but at the same time, it also hopes to cut purchasers' costs -- for example by eliminating the thousands of dollars that title insurance can cost.

Slow down there a minute

For something as hyped as blockchain, with millions of dollars raised, you have to expect some backlash. There's plenty, starting with the criticism that blockchain would have already taken off if it's so great and concerns that it's abetting cryptocurrency shenanigans. There's also the concern that poorly written code could leave a faulty foundation.

Overinflated expectations are nothing new to the tech industry, though, and there are enough serious players engaged that it's hard to dismiss blockchain as all sizzle and no steak. Expect a winnowing as reality sets in.

""In 2018, we expect to see a number of projects stopped that should never have been started in the first place,"" said Forrester analyst Martha Bennett.

She points out plenty of other areas where blockchain falls short of its promises. The immutability comes at a cost, lacking some of the mechanisms for recourse found in today's slower processes. Companies cooperating to set up their own private blockchains, rather than using public ones like Ethereum, must have some trust already to set up rules for access and governance.

Here's another hitch: getting everybody on board. The French automaker Renault, for example, hopes for a blockchain to lock down car maintenance records. After all, who wouldn't want to know if the used car you're thinking of buying made lots of trips to the repair shop? It turns out the seller may not share your enthusiasm for that much transparency.

So it's not perfect. But it doesn't have to be. Blockchain just has to be better than what we have today. There are a lot of underhanded cryptocurrency dealings, but regulators are now reining in abuses, said Rick Levin, chairman of the financial technology and regulation team at the AmLaw law firm Polsinelli. Likewise, engineers are hammering out improvements to blockchain and big names like Nasdaq and Goldman Sachs are embracing it.

""I don't think it's just going to vanish,"" Levin said. ""There's too much energy behind this.""

Nas and Snoop Dogg have backed trading application Robinhood, and now legendary rap star Jay-Z has added his imprimatur through a subsidiary, Arrive. Robinhood is already valued at over a billion dollars, closing in on 1.5 billion as of this writing, having recently announced Robinhood Crypto.

Jay-Z Goes Crypto

Shawn Carter, 48, better known as Jay-Z, owns an entertainment-centric management company, Roc Nation: talent agency, concert promotion, music production, record label, film production, and even music publishing are among its calling. The 21 Grammy-winning, 100 million records sold mogul can now add crypto to that list.

In Spring of last year, Mr. Carter announced a subsidiary, Arrive Venture Capital, under his Roc Nation banner (itself owned by Live Nation Entertainment, which in turn is owned by Liberty Media) to focus on startups. Mr. Carter’s penchant for investing in hungry companies goes back at least as far as 2012, when he reportedly went tech: luggage maker Away, private jet outfit Jetsmarter, and even a series B round with Uber.

Arrive’s head Neil Sirni explained, “Arrive was created to leverage our experience and resources in building brands, developing consumer-facing businesses, managing artists and representing athletes. We’ve opened that diversified, global range of expertise to a new vertical: entrepreneurs and their early stage businesses.”

Robinhood late last month announced it was expanding its services to include free trades in bitcoin and ether, and it set off a firestorm of publicity. Though the company doesn’t plan to become a cryptocurrency exchange proper, analysts believe such a format could one day seriously challenge more well-established platforms. Within a week, over one million people signed up for the service.

Not His First Rodeo

Mr. Sirni continued, “We believe in Baiju and Vlad’s mission to make the financial markets more accessible and cost efficient for customers of all size. Robinhood will have our support as they execute the long-term vision of their company.”



Robinhood already has over three million users. Its total value is inching near one and a half billion dollars. Its model is a loss leader, with stock trades being essentially free. It also launched a web-based service, and its Robinhood Crypto, though limited in scope initially, is already considered a success as mentioned in cointrust.com.

Arrive has invested in the location sharing project Insite Applications, and Devialet, an audio technology company. Robinhood is Arrive’s third venture, and comes immediately after the startup’s bitcoin and either announcement.

Though rappers such as 50 Cent have notoriously invested in bitcoin as well, Jay-Z was the first. His Soldier Field stadium concert partnered with local newspaper Chicago Sun Times to sell tickets in bitcoin through a third party vendor.

What are your thoughts on Jay’s move? Let us know in the comments section below.

Ryan Derks, of Ryan’s Hodl Fund, recently spoke with Express.co.uk and claimed that Bitcoin could reach an extraordinary value if more of the world’s population decides to rebel against traditional currency. He explained: “I believe they say that roughly five per cent of the world’s population or less owns any cryptocurrency and if the trends of Venezuela continue and in Zimbabwe, if those continue it looks as though there is going to be no slowdown. “I only imagine it’s going to continue pushing prices up because again there’s a limited supply. “So if people continue to lose faith in their nation’s currency, like for example the US dollar, I don’t have very much faith at all.

Getty Ryan Derks claimed that Bitcoin could reach an extraordinary value

“I would much rather have my money in a currency that I know can’t be manipulated and forged. “So in my opinion it’s going to continue, now I think that $100,000 dollars for a Bitcoin is not far-fetched. “When that will happen I can’t tell you, but if you just assume that 10 per cent of the world’s population or 15 per cent of the world’s population decides to give up their government’s currency and use cryptocurrency then yes, that’s not far-fetched at all.”

The expert stated that if the adoption rate of cryptocurrencies in third world countries continues, they could play an incredibly influential part. Mr Derks continued: “Again if you look back at the adoption rate currently among second and third-world nations it is shooting through the roof. “A lot them don’t really need to be lectured about the benefits of a currency that cannot be manipulated.”

Bitcoin prices soared last year and saw the prized currency hit an all-time high of $19,535.70 on December 17. However, since the incredible spike the currency has failed to maintain its trajectory. When questioned on its fluctuating prices, Mr Derks explained that Bitcoin functions on “basic supply and demand economics”. He said: “For me I can’t say exactly but I can estimate and what I estimate is based off of the internal code of what makes Bitcoin work is nothing more than just the basic supply and demand economics.

Getty Bitcoin prices soared last year and saw the prized currency hit an all-time high

“So as less coins are available and more people are demanding them the price will increase.” The Bitcoin owner explained that there will only ever be 21million coins in existence, of which an estimated 25 per cent have already been lost, mostly in the early years of the currency when people did not take it “too seriously”. He stated: “It’s estimated right now that about 25 per cent of all the coins in existence have been lost, many people back in the first four or five years didn’t take it too seriously and didn’t pay close care over the coins so quite a few were lost.

Blockchain technology and its most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, have been called of equal importance to the internet, capable of transforming businesses, government, and social interaction: the entire fabric of modern society. The enthusiasm—and the hype—are both inescapable and infectious. The assumption behind the enthusiasm is that blockchain and cryptocurrencies will change the world for the better. And perhaps indeed they will; I myself am optimistic. The technology can enable democratized access to services such as medical care, financial services, and energy. As a crypto investor, this is the vision I hope to help realize.

But there is a darker side to the technology and the industry. We must recognize and address this danger soon, or else we run the risk of undoing decades of social and environmental progress. This threat is the immense energy consumption and potential climate impact of the blockchain and its two leading currencies, bitcoin and ethereum.

Cryptocurrency’s energy impact

While we have yet to see clear consensus regarding overall energy intensity, we do know that it is extraordinarily high. A recent New York Times article offers the following sobering estimate:

“The computer power needed to create a single digital token consumes at least as much electricity as the average American household burns through in two years, according to figures from Morgan Stanley and Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry.”

The same article says that the computer network utilized to power the bitcoin network consumes as much energy per day as some medium-sized countries do each day. On a more granular level, Alex de Vries, an economist who tracks energy use in the industry, estimates that each individual bitcoin transaction “currently requires 80,000 times more electricity to process than a Visa credit card transaction.”

These are eye-popping claims. Even the founder of ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, has voiced alarm about the climate impact of the network he himself pioneered, and is working to advance less-intensive network practices. “I would personally feel very unhappy if my main contribution to the world was adding Cyprus’s worth of electricity consumption to global warming,” he said in an interview with the New York Times.

Buterin is right to be concerned: We are facing a potentially exponential global energy increase from an industry that arose less than a decade ago and is growing at light speed. Due to the design of the underlying protocol, as the industry continues to explode and more and more transactions are conducted on the blockchain, each individual transaction itself becomes increasingly energy-intensive to compute.

A bit of background may prove helpful. Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, is a part of something called blockchain. So are other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and litecoin. Blockchain is a list of transactions maintained by community of users, rather than a central authority, which records transactions across many computers. The process of writing new blocks in the blockchain is called “mining.” Cryptocurrency “miners” unlock new coins while simultaneously protecting against fraud by adding new block to the chain.

Bitcoin already consumes 0.15% of the world’s energy.

This process makes the fundamental architecture of the ecosystem energy intensive and environmentally unsustainable. According to the bitcoin energy consumption index, the digital currency already consumes 0.15% of the world’s energy, and far exceeds the electricity consumption of Ireland or of most African nations. That is a lot of energy. While less energy-intensive changes to the underlying protocol are on the horizon, they will not occur overnight, and there is little certainty that they will be adopted.

According to the 2017 US Energy Information Association report, global energy demand is projected to grow by 28% by 2040. Adding another quarter of the world’s energy production in two decades is a daunting enough challenge as is without accounting for an entirely new, supremely energy-intensive industry. Worse, the International Energy Agency estimates that in 2017, 17% of the world’s population was still without access to electricity, and 38% were without clean cooking facilities.

How do we reconcile this? Blockchain proponents argue that the technology will democratize access to these basic services by removing the control of centralized institutions and putting the self-determining powers of commerce and development in the hands of the common person.

But will it? And when? And, most importantly, at what immediate cost to the climate?

Environmentally friendly mining

We’ve made too much climate progress in recent decades to risk undermining our collective carbon-reduction efforts for an industry that, despite all its future promise, is at present speculative and experimental. The potential environmental and social cost is far too high. We are all familiar with the urgency around our present rates of global warming and the difficulty transitioning to clean energy, so we do not have the luxury of deferring any cryptocurrency consumption questions to a later date.

It’s therefore imperative that we use renewable energy to supply the consumption needs of the growing blockchain ecosystem. There are a few tools we have at our disposal to address this issue head-on.

As is often pointed out, blockchain computation (and the server farms that power them) are distributed: Processing can be conducted from anywhere and is not tied to given geographies or jurisdictions. Coin “mining” is profitable and requires bulk processing power, so for developers and miners, there is a strong economic incentive to locate where energy is cheapest.

But it’s not just about price—it should be about the environment, too. In the very near future, I hope to see public pressure or private incentives to locate computation when energy isn’t only cheapest, but also cleanest. In the past, this has led to developments like the Facebook hydroelectric data center in the Arctic, where the location in the typically cold town of Luleå uses large fans to pull in the outside air to naturally cool the thousands of warm servers that line the center’s broad hallways. A dozen hydro-electric plants also operate on nearby rivers, providing a reliable and renewable power source. As a result, the system is 10% more efficient and uses almost 40% less power than traditional data centers.

Surplus energy from traditional renewable-energy plants could be harnessed to power blockchain computation.

Similarly, bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos has noted that surplus energy from traditional renewable-energy plants could be harnessed to power blockchain computation. This could offer clean-energy sources another source of potential revenue, effectively turning blockchain computing into a renewable subsidy—a good idea indeed. But while wind and solar energy are wonderful, they’re also famously intermittent; they’re not always available when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. “One of the fundamental issues, and potentially environmental costs, of wind and solar technologies is the fact of their intermittency—they require energy storage in some form or another,” says clean energy expert Caitlin Sparks.

Instead of using renewable-energy plants, we could be using waste-to-energy technologies. Each year, nations generate 1.3 billion tons of waste, which is expected to soar to 4 billion tons by 2100, according to Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, senior director for the World Bank’s social, urban, rural, and resilience global practice. In the developed world, municipal waste is incinerated or landfilled; both methods are costly, inefficient, and outdated. In the developing world, the situation is worse: Waste is typically open-burned or dumped on land, oceans, and waterways

Thankfully, it is possible today to convert waste (agricultural, forest, even municipal waste) into energy or fuel. And it’s being done in many parts of the world with different technologies: anaerobic digestion, pyrolysis, and, most effectively, gasification. “It’s an obvious triple win, solving the waste, energy, and climate crises in one package,” Sparks says.

As the blockchain industry proliferates, we must harness clean-energy technologies to fuel its growth. Just as blockchain technologies can disrupt outdated, centralized institutions and usher in a new era of distributed processes, the energy plants of the future will likely also be distributed.

Now is not the time to replicate our energy and environmental ignorance of the past. We must deploy solutions that reflect a more thoughtful, sustainable world. We all have a role to play in advocating for a cleaner, more sustainable future, and we are privileged to live in a moment of tremendous potential and transformation. With a little creative thinking and collective will, we can make the blockchain revolution one that everyone can be proud of.",

Its breakneck 1,850% run in 2017 put the cryptocurrency on the map. In 2018, however, Bitcoin prices have been all over that map – dishing out anguish for anyone who’s not been on the right side of the wild swings. Most long-term-minded investors have avoided the cryptocurrency altogether, partially because digital currencies feel philosophically flawed, and partially because they wanted to steer clear of all the volatility. But there’s still something compelling about the technology, even if a newcomer to cryptocurrencies can’t quite articulate why they see a future for them. The key to navigating the volatility and looking past the noise? First and foremost, understand that Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) isn’t the same thing as blockchain. Blockchain is the underlying digital record system that makes Bitcoin “work.” It powers other digital currencies, too, and is being increasingly used in other ways, such as improving cloud storage or keeping track of legal documents. As such, blockchain should be around in the future even if Bitcoin itself falls off the radar. Here’s a run-down of some of the top ways to invest in blockchain without directly exposing your portfolio to less predictable instruments like Bitcoin itself. These stocks and funds all have a stake in the future of blockchain, to varying degrees. Data is as of Feb. 12, 2018. Click on ticker-symbol links in each slide for current share prices and more.

Overstock.com Many people know Overstock.com (OSTK, $55.65) as an online retailer that got its start selling surplus inventory, but has expanded to new merchandise. What they might not know is that over the past few years, it has become a surprising blockchain play. The average investor still may not fully understand exactly what Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne is trying to accomplish with the creation of tZERO. It will be an SEC-regulated alternative trading system, with the ultimate goal of becoming a blockchain-based global property registry that becomes (among other things) a universally accepted means of supplying collateral to lenders. With the exception of being regulated, the vision still doesn’t explain why Byrne’s take on the whole cryptocurrency craze will stand out. But it’s the less obvious aspect of Byrne’s effort that’s likely to matter. As D.A. Davidson equity analyst Tom Forte put it: “Our research increased our conviction that, today and likely in the near-term, Overstock stands head and shoulders above the others, when it comes to having developed a portfolio of companies with significant efforts to exploit blockchain technology.” Veteran short seller Marc Cohodes believes a successful execution of Byrne’s plan could make Overstock shares worth between $200 and $400 apiece.

MasterCard It should come as no surprise that credit card middleman MasterCard (MA, $168.19) is in the cryptocurrency loop. In many regards, MasterCard and blockchain accomplish the same thing. If blockchain is a better way of exchanging money for goods and services – without borders or currency exchange walls getting in the way – then MasterCard has good reason to be interested. That’s why in October, the company began to facilitate payments using blockchain-based technologies, even if Bitcoin itself wasn’t part of the ecosystem. In light of the company’s unique position as one of the world’s most recognizable intermediaries between spenders and vendors, it doesn’t appear MasterCard is doing much on this front. But don’t be fooled. MasterCard is merely proceeding cautiously, waiting to see what gels on the cryptocurrency front. In the meantime, the credit card icon is tied for second in terms of the number of U.S. patents held on blockchain technologies, and recently has requested one that facilitates instant blockchain payment processing. Such a patent theoretically could allow MasterCard to offer consumer-held, blockchain-based credit and debit cards.

International Business Machines If you’re a believer in the notion that paper money is a relic and will soon be displaced by legitimate blockchain money, think about International Business Machines (IBM, $150.58). Yes, this is the same IBM that has been floundering for years now, mostly missing out on the advent of cloud computing by leaning on its legacy hardware and software business for too long. It has seen the light, however. Tapping its deep pockets and talent pool, it has come up with several 21st century products. In fact, a recent report from Juniper Research indicated that IBM was viewed as the most reliable name in the nascent blockchain business. That’s going to mean a lot to regulators and government agencies, as well as large organizations that can’t afford for their foray into the world of cryptocurrency to be anything less than perfect. In fact, the relatively small launch of its blockchain platform is already showing tremendous promise. UBS says that for customers IBM already is serving in its global financing unit, the utilization of blockchain “has reduced dispute resolution time from over 50 to fewer than 10 days and reduced administrative costs.” International Business Machines also employs blockchain technologies that allow for more efficient tracking of shipments, improve food safety and more. The use of the underlying technologies is limited only to IBM’s imagination.

Eastman Kodak The Eastman Kodak (KODK, $5.85) that became a household name by making now-obsolete camera film is still around. It found refuge in video film and printing, as well as retooling for more specialized industrial applications. In terms of revenue, it’s still nowhere near what it once was during its heyday in the 1980s and ‘90s, but the advent of blockchain may breathe new life into this old company yet. The knee-jerk response to the recently unveiled KodakCoin may be concern that yet another wannabe is jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon with no clear picture of what it hopes to accomplish. But there’s a method to the madness. Kodak aims to cultivate a digital currency that not only facilitates the payments for photographers’ images that should drive royalty revenue for them, but also uses blockchain to ensure those photographs aren’t being used without the owner’s permission. Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke explained: “For many in the tech industry, ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem. Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.” The digital photography market could be worth more than $100 billion per year by 2021, yet still is akin to the Wild West when it comes to collecting payments for use of those images.

Nvidia One curious nuance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they have to be digitally “mined.” A particular Bitcoin is just a collection of unique codes, but the blockchain-based programming that makes Bitcoin work as described means there are only 21 million possible variants. So, at most, there will only be 21 million Bitcoins in existence. The oddity: Only a fraction of those 21 million possibilities had been calculated at the onset of Bitcoin. Computers all over the world have been crunching the numbers, so to speak, to discover the remainder. The lucrative part for folks who went to the trouble of mining them is, if they find any Bitcoin, they get to keep it as their own. Enter Nvidia (NVDA, $228.03), maker of computer chips and graphics cards. As it turns out, graphic cards are ideally suited to perform the computations required in Bitcoin mining, which are incredibly resource-intensive. Regular computer processors can do the work too, but graphics processors are far more effective, hence the surge in demand for GPUs last year. Rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rode the same wave. It remains to be seen what kind of a role Nvidia will play in the future of blockchain. The “discovery” model that has powered most of the major cryptocurrency mining done thus far, though, is likely to apply in the future. The math has to be done somehow, and Nvidia remains best-positioned to provide the solution.

Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF Although Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies have been around for years, it has taken a long while for the ETF industry to get on board. But it’s finally in the game – sort of. The Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN, $22.79), which launched just a few days ago, holds stocks such as the aforementioned Overstock and IBM, as well as Intel (INTC) and Cisco Systems (CSCO). None are dedicated cryptocurrency plays, but all of them will benefit from the advent of blockchain as the preferred method of digitally doing business. The fund was initially intended to include “blockchain” in its moniker, but the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Reality Shares to remove the word to keep the mania to a minimum. Eric Ervin, CEO of Reality Shares, says about the potential of the newly minted ETF, “Blockchain is still in its infancy, and we are confident it will have far-reaching, disruptive effects in nearly every industry.” Ervin acknowledges the fund’s holdings don’t derive most of their revenue from cryptocurrencies right now, but also feels the “blockchain ecosystem potentially presents one of the most profound, long-term investment opportunities many of us have or will ever see in our lifetime.” BLCN charges 0.68% in expenses, or $68 annually on a $10,000 investment.

Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF Reality Shares’ new ETF surfaced right around the same time the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK, $18.90) did. For the same reason Reality Shares couldn’t use the word “blockchain” in the name of the recently-launched fund, Amplify can’t either. However, BLOK also is a play on the companies best-positioned to benefit from the new-era currency, and similarly priced at 0.7% in annual fees. Holdings include Overstock, Square (SQ) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), just to name a few. Don’t be surprised if the top holdings change rather quickly, though. A wide swath of Amplify’s ETFs are index funds and their underlying positions don’t shift much, but BLOK is a different breed. It’s going to be an actively managed fund. Amplify CEO Christian Magoon explains, “Our key differentiator is that we believe you have to be active when you engage in this space. In order to capture the upside and manage downside risk, you have to be, on a daily basis, looking at this and adjusting your portfolio.” That’s not a bad strategy, considering the blockchain movement has only just begun and remains a moving target.",2018-02-13,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/13/cryptocurrency-mining-in-iceland-is-using-so-much-energy-the-electricity-may-run-out/,"Companies have flooded Iceland with requests to open new data centers to “mine” cryptocurrencies in recent months, even as concerns mount that the country may have to slow down investments amid an increasingly stretched electricity generation capacity.

“There was a lot of talk about data centers in Iceland about five years ago, but it was a slow start,” Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, a spokesman for Icelandic energy producer HS Orka, told The Washington Post. “But six months ago, interest suddenly began to spike. And over the last three months, we have received about one call per day from foreign companies interested in setting up projects here.”

“If all these projects are realized, we won’t have enough energy for it,” Sigurbergsson said earlier to the BBC.

The Associated Press first reported the surge in demand.

Every cryptocurrency in the world relies on a “blockchain” platform, which is needed to trade with digital currencies. Tracking and verifying a transaction on such a platform is like solving a puzzle because networks are often decentralized, and there is no single authority in charge of monitoring payments. As a result, a transaction involves an immense number of mathematical calculations, which in turn occupy vast computer server capacity. And that requires a lot of electricity.

The bitcoin rush may have come as a surprise to locals in sleepy Icelandic towns that are suddenly bustling with cryptocurrency technicians, but there’s a simple explanation. “The economics of bitcoin mining mean that most miners need access to reliable and very cheap power on the order of 2 or 3 cents per kilowatt hour. As a result, a lot are located near sources of hydro power, where it’s cheap,” Sam Hartnett, an associate at the nonprofit energy research and consulting group Rocky Mountain Institute, told The Washington Post's Chris Mooney and Steven Mufson in December.

Located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and famous for its hot springs and mighty rivers, Iceland produces about 80 percent of its energy in hydroelectric power stations, compared with about 6 percent in the United States. That and the cold climate make it a perfect location for new data-mining centers filled with servers in danger of overheating.

Those conditions have attracted scores of foreign companies to the remote location, including Germany's Genesis Mining, which moved to Iceland about three years ago. More have followed suit since then or are in the process of moving.

While some analysts are already sensing a possible new revenue source for the country that is mainly known abroad as a tourist haven and low-budget airline hub, others are more concerned by a phenomenon that has so far mostly alarmed analysts because of its possible financial unsustainability. Certain estimates have concluded that cryptocurrency computer operations may already account for as much as the equivalent of Denmark's energy needs.

Most analysts agree that the real energy-consumption figure is likely smaller, and several experts recently told The Washington Post that bitcoin — currently the world's biggest cryptocurrency — used no more than 0.14 percent of the world’s generated electricity, as of last December. Even though global consumption may not be as significant as some have claimed, it still presents a worrisome drain for a tiny country such as Iceland, where consumption suddenly began to spike with almost no warning — and continues to grow fast.

Some networks are considering or have already pushed through changes to their protocols, designed to reduce energy use. But implementing such changes for the leading currency, bitcoin, won't be as easy because it is inherently decentralized. The companies that provide the vast amounts of computing power needed for these transactions earn a small share, comparable to a processing fee or a reward.

They are the source of the Icelandic bitcoin miners’ income — a revenue source that many Icelanders are still not quite sure what to make of.",2018-02-13,https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-thailand-bans-banks-from-cryptocurrency-activities/,"Bank of Thailand Bans Banks From Cryptocurrency Activities

The Thai central bank has prohibited financial institutions in the country from five key cryptocurrency activities, including banning customers from buying cryptocurrencies with credit cards.

Banks Banned From 5 Crypto Activities

The Bank of Thailand (BOT) issued a circular on Monday asking “financial institutions not to get involved in cryptocurrency transactions for fear of possible problems from the unregulated trading,” Reuters translated.

Mr. Wisit Santiprabop, the central bank’s governor, signed the circular which outlines five key cryptocurrency activities banks are banned from:

Investing or trading in cryptocurrency, exchanging cryptocurrencies, creating platforms for cryptocurrency trading, allowing clients to use credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies, and from advising customers on cryptocurrency investing or trading.

The central bank stated that “cryptocurrencies were not legal tender in Thailand,” the publication conveyed, adding that “it was worried that they may be used in illegal activities such as money laundering or supporting terrorism.”

Recently, the Thai government announced that it will not ban cryptocurrencies and is developing a regulatory framework for them.

Banks Complying

Ms. Prasanee Auiyamaphan, a Bangkok Bank Executive Assistant, was quoted by Voice TV saying that the bank has “no policy to provide [crypto] exchange services,” emphasizing that cryptocurrencies cannot be exchanged for cash at her bank.

Mr. Thana Thienachariya, Senior Executive VP and Chief Marketing Officer at Siam Commercial Bank said that its subsidiary, Digital Ventures Co. Ltd., has previously formed a strategic alliance with Ripple to offer a payment service between Japan and Thailand. He added that his bank will be discussing this issue with the central bank.

Mr. Thakorn Piyapan, Head of Krungsri Consumer Group and an executive of Digital Banking and Innovation at Bank of Ayudhya said, “although the bank will use the transfer service across the country through Ripple,” it is cooperating with the BOT and “does not provide any [cryptocurrency] services at all.”

He explained that there are some areas that banks need to examine before being able to comply. For example, to prevent customers from buying cryptocurrencies using credit cards, he elaborated:

In Thailand, people are buying digital currency. So the bank is asking for time to check the type of transactions that customers [make when they] swipe cards that are associated with digital currency. If applicable, the bank may have to suspend the service.

Recently, banks in the US and well as the UK have also banned their credit card customers from buying cryptocurrencies.

As for cryptocurrency traders, Poramin Insom, managing director of the Thai crypto exchange TDAX, said that “there is no impact on people who are investors of cryptocurrencies,” the news outlet quoted him. However, he explained, “TDAX is affected by this announcement, which makes the process of opening an account with the bank take longer. Bank of Thailand requests more documents.”

This is despite nearly 57 percent of the 2000 Americans surveyed by the credit score startup and research firm Qualtrics last month saying they had realized some gains from cryptocurrencies, according to a Credit Karma study.

Roughly the same percentage said they had never reported cryptocurrency gains to the Internal Revenue Service, while nearly half of those polled said they understood how owning cryptocurrencies affected their taxes, the study said.

The IRS considers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as property for federal tax purposes, meaning any profits or losses from the sale or exchange of the virtual coins should generally be reported as capital gains or losses.

Trading of cryptocurrencies, digital tokens whose value is not backed by central banks and hard assets, surged in 2017 amid a rally in their price. A single bitcoin is worth more than $8000, compared with $1000 a year ago.

Despite the surge it remains unclear how many Americans hold cryptocurrencies as these are bought and sold on online platforms, sometimes anonymously or using pseudonyms. US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase says it has 10 million users, although it is unclear how many of these are in the U.S.

Jagjit Chawla, general manager for Credit Karma Tax said the company was not too surprised that few people had reported cryptocurrency gains as Americans with more complex tax situations tend to file closer to the deadline.

“However, given the popularity of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2017, we’d expect more people to be reporting,” Chawla said in a statement.

The deadline for filing taxes this is year is April 17.

The IRS projects that around 156 million individuals will file this year.

Around 1 million people filed their taxes with Credit Karma’s service last year.",2018-02-13 08:04:03+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-13-salon-readers-choose-ads-or-crypto-mining.html,"If you choose to opt in, Salon says it will use a small portion of your computer's spare processing power to mine the cryptocurrency Monero and it notes that you won't have to install anything on your computer in order to let this happen. The site also says that it won't have access to anyone's personal files or information if they choose to opt in.

Salon's mining efforts are powered by Coinhive, which created these sorts of scripts for exactly this reason. The Pirate Bay tried using it to generate ad-free revenue last year. However, while Salon is giving users an option to give up their computers to crypto mining, Coinhive's scripts have been previously slipped into other unsuspecting sites. Showtime, Politifact and a slew of government sites have all unknowingly hosted the cryptocurrency miner in the past.

That a popular publication would choose to generate revenue through cryptocurrency mining seems pretty wild, but this could be a sign of things to come. Media outlets have consistently said they're losing money from ad-blockers, and if Salon's test is successful, more might follow its lead. If you agree to let Salon mine Monero with your computer, that setting will be good for up to 24 hours. After that, it will again prompt you to choose between your ad-blocker and the miner.

The largest free economic zone in the UAE, with zero percent personal and corporate income tax, has started issuing licenses to firms trading cryptocurrencies. The first license has been issued to a gold trader that has recently started offering cryptocurrency services.

Attracting Crypto Businesses

The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) is a government entity established in 2002 to enhance commodity trade flows through Dubai. DMCC Free Zone is the largest and fastest growing free economic zone in the UAE.

“We perform a range of roles which continue to position Dubai as the preferred destination for global commodities trade and DMCC as the world’s No.1 Free Zone,” offering zero percent personal and corporate income tax, the center’s website states. Today, more than 14,100 multinational corporations and startups call DMCC home, with almost 90,000 people living and working there.

The Centre has started issuing licenses to allow firms trading in cryptocurrencies to operate from its free zone, Thomson Reuters Zawya reported on Monday.

DMCC’s executive director for commodities, Sanjeev Dutta, told the publication that the Centre is “beginning to facilitate” a market in cryptocurrencies which, he acknowledged, is unregulated. Citing that firms looking to set up in the zone would be considered on a “case-by-case” basis, he elaborated:

To me, what is important is the fact that you are still evaluating it as part of your innovation strategy. You are not saying ‘no’ to something. You are not saying ‘yes’ either, but you are exploring, so you are clearly ahead of the others when the time to make a decision comes.

Cryptocurrencies as Commodities

DMCC is a member of the Global Blockchain Council, which began as a Dubai Smart City project and has 46 member organizations globally today. The Centre’s director of innovation hub, Franco Bosoni, said that a global consensus is emerging which favors classifying cryptocurrencies as commodities, the news outlet detailed and quoted him explaining:

DMCC’s view is that these [cryptocurrencies] meet the test of a commodity. They’re priced based on supply and demand, produced and sold globally at a uniform quality and (are) indistinguishable between products.

Wai Lum Kwok, head of capital markets for Abu Dhabi Global Markets Regulatory Authority, told the publication on Sunday that the regulator is “reviewing and considering the development of a robust, risk-appropriate regulatory framework” for crypto exchanges and intermediaries. Emphasizing that no timeframe has been set, he added:

As we develop our framework, we will also want to check in and have the conversations with, for example, US regulators, Japanese regulators and so on and so forth, so that there is some alignment of approach to avoid any regulatory arbitrage.

First License Issued

The first license for the Free Zone reportedly went to Regal Assets, a gold trader and storage provider with offices in the US, Canada, and the UAE. The company added cryptocurrencies to its product line at the end of last year, offering brokerage services and an insured, high-security cold storage service for bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, ethereum classic, ripple, and dash.

According to Bloomberg, “Dubai gold trader Regal RA DMCC is the first company in the Middle East to get a license to trade cryptocurrencies.” The news outlet quoted DMCC acknowledging in a statement, “The company will offer storage of bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in a vault located in DMCC headquarters in Almas Tower in Dubai.”

DMCC Executive Chairman Ahmed Bin Sulayem was quoted by the publication, “At the heart of DMCC’s long-term strategic growth plan is the use of technology and innovation to disrupt and connect new markets, industries and customers,” adding that “the announcement today embodies this approach.”

According to Reuters, the central bank released a circular Monday that bans banks in Thailand from investing and trading in crypto, as well as participating in and creating exchanges and platforms for crypto trading.The circular applies specifically to banks, not to exchanges or other services, which are still allowed to operate freely in the country.

Banks were also asked not to advise customers on crypto investment or trading, and to ban clients from using credit cards for crypto purchases. Several large banks globally have already instituted a similar ban of credit card purchases of crypto last week, as the crypto markets took a dip to new multi-month record lows.

In explaining their reasoning for the ban on banks’ dealing with crypto, The Bank of Thailand cited concerns over digital currencies being used for illegal activities, such as money laundering or terrorist activities, and noted that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in the country.

Regulate, not ban

Thai Finance Minister Apisak Tantivorawong had stated on Feb. 7 that the Thai government will not ban crypto trading, but will work on constructing a regulatory framework for digital currencies, the Bangkok Post reported. The Bank of Thailand’s circular can be seen as warning banks away from crypto until this regulatory framework can be implemented.

In September, 2017, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Thailand) had also announced a willingness to support Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) by implementing regulations that would protect investors against fraud. Yesterday, Feb.12, SEC secretary-general Rapee Sucharitakul said the SEC does not have the ability to block crypto transactions as they are traded through online platforms, but will attempt to educate investors to protect them from ICO scams, the Bangkok Post reported.

Thailand’s Ministry of Finance had said Feb. 2 that the Bank of Thailand and the SEC Thailand should warn customers about investing in crypto markets, but that Blockchain technology could be useful for Thailand’s financial sector.

The central Bank of Thailand had previously held a meeting with Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin in August 2017 about the future possibility of integrating Ethereum into the Thai financial sector to improve the efficiency of already existing infrastructure.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/so-is-there-a-correlation-between-bitcoin-and-stock-market-yes-but-no,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

Looking at the Bitcoin graph, and that of the stock market, including the Dow Jones and the S&P 500, you may have noted an interesting similarity. The stock market was growing to new heights rapidly, with even Donald Trump tweeting how it had risen 20 percent since his election. A little before these heights, Bitcoin had also surged up to its all-time high of $20,000 on Dec. 17.

Both markets then started to plunge, first, it was Bitcoin, whose price steadily dropped towards $6,000 before hitting a floor. The stock market fell a lot quicker, but the pattern looked remarkably similar, with them both finding a floor last Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its biggest one-day point drop in history on Monday, and the S&P 500 had its worst day since 2011. Questions then started to spring up whether or not there was a correlation between the vastly different assets. And can we predict the future moves?

What happened to the stock

To determine if there is a correlation, one needs to address the reasons why the stock market is down and investors are seemingly selling off. John F. Wasik, behavioral finance Forbes columnist lists a couple of reasons why the Stocks have crashed. He believes that the general stock market was overpriced, and uses a gauge by Robert Shiller, a Yale economics professor, to assess that. He adds that volatility has returned, looking to the VIX index, and this is important in looking for the Bitcoin correlation.

Furthermore, interest rates are rising and there is a belief that inflation may be on its way back. What happens next? According to Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the computers (which make 90 percent of deals on the stock market) make their turn, calculating that even higher inflation is inevitable.

And why Bitcoin took a dip

These explanations as to why the stock market crashed are vastly different to the reasons why it was assumed that Bitcoin fell by almost 70 percent. The problem for Bitcoin, following an expected correction once it hit $20,000, was that there was a stream of damaging media reports, some of them unfounded and simply incorrect.

The confusion firstly in South Korea about a potential ban did its damage before it was eventually cleared up by the South Korean Government. Then, China announced it would be putting one more nail into Bitcoin’s coffin within the country by placing a firewall up to restrict foreign access to exchanges. There was even news out of India that was flagrantly misinterpreted, also regarding a potential ban, that saw Bitcoin plummet.

From these external events, there is no discernible relationship as to why the Bitcoin market and the Stock market fell at the same time. But looking deeper in terms of correlation graphs, you can see some sort of link.

Z-scores and fear gauge

One area of data which seems to show a sort of correlation is in a matrix of z-scores and p-scores. These correlation graphs are quite confusing, but the just of it is that if two assets share a z-score that is negative or positive, there is evidence of either a direct or inverse relationship.

In the graph below, the numbers are called z-scores. They represent the direction and strength of the relationship between the two sets of data. A higher absolute z-score means greater correlation, while a lower absolute z-score means less of a correlation.

Image source: Sifr Data

A simple glance at this correlation graph can show that the relationship between Bitcoin and S&P 500 is at a weak positive relationship. But, the correlation between VIX and Bitcoin -0.31 making it a moderate negative relationship.

The VIX is a so-called ‘fear gauge’ and indicates the level of risk that is currently present in the markets at any time. According to this graph, there should be an inverse correlation between VIX and Bitcoin, and this was demonstrated in an article on CBOE’s website that overlayed the VIX and Bitcoin price. So it is between the VIX and Bitcoin, not the Stock Market itself, where the correlation seems to exist. But then again, for the last three years, VIX Index outperformed Bitcoin in terms of volatility and in 2015-2016 the correlation was almost non-existing, it’s 2017 that matches the pattern.

Fundstrat Tom Lee shared his agreement with this sentiment on CNBC stating that the initial relationship between the Stock Graphs and the Bitcoin price had only limited correlation.

""[Bitcoin’s] could easily look like a chart that looks like the S&P, because both had a parabolic move and then subsequently gave back some of these gains,"" Lee told CNBC’s ""Trading Nation.""

But that's where the relationship may stagnate. Lee added that ""the connection between the two is really, really limited."" He went on to discuss that the correlation, if any, may have been down to a more cavalier approach by investors who were also then buying cryptocurrency.

""In the past 12 months, not only did we have a strong rally in equities, we had a strong rally in cryptocurrencies. I wouldn't be surprised if those investors who saw risk-on assets everywhere outperforming globally were also buying cryptocurrencies.""

Analysts at Datatrek added to Lee’s sentiment about this ‘crossover’ of investors. They stated:

“Since investors have only one brain to process risk, they will make similar decisions about cryptocurrencies and stocks when they see price volatility in the latter.”

Correlation in the future?

Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo, believes that perhaps there is a stronger correlation than has been stated previously, but he, like Lee and Datatrek analysts, is linking these relationships more to sentiment that empirical evidence. ""On Monday [February 5] what we saw is all risk products sell off,"" Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" A hit on the market, in his opinion, can cause investors to panic and begin selling Bitcoin as well: ""It sometimes adds fuel to the fire.”

Again, it is this idea that Bitcoin has crossed a threshold into the mainstream market too that could perhaps be causing this assumed correlation. Harvey, and others, talk of similar sentiment meaning a similar sell off across the two markets. Morgan Stanley analysts have also stated that perhaps traditional investors were transferring risk from the relatively stable equities markets into Bitcoin, and vice versa, showing again this crossover that could be amalgamating the markets slightly.

Marcus Poh, Trading Trainee at Octagon Strategy, also believes that the two markets are starting to intermingle somewhat as he states:

“As for it being indirectly related, I would say that BTC is considered to many as a hedge against currencies, similar to that of gold. Therefore, if the demand, recognition and acceptance of BTC becomes much larger, there is a chance it would be in a similar position to that of gold and the stock market.”

Fear breeds fear

Perhaps for now the idea of correlation between the Bitcoin market and that of traditional stocks is limited to the “fear index” because of cryptocurrency buzz in 2017 and the bull rally of investors. They cannot truly be plotted on a graph against one another, and have often deviated at key moments. For example, In August last year, the global economy took a major hit in the face of rising tensions between the US and North Korea, but the Bitcoin market remained unfazed.

But what could be concluded from this recent pattern across the markets is that investor sentiment can carry over from the stock market to the Bitcoin market. Because of a mainstream adoption wave that has seen Bitcoin accepted as an investable asset, there is the beginnings of a crossover.

Thus, when fear and risk enters the stock market for reasons outlines by John Wasik then the VIX also starts to rise. It has been shown that there is an inverse correlation between this and the price of Bitcoin which can be seen on an overlapping graph. None of these relationships or correlations, tenuous as they are, can really aid in predicting the markets, they can only prove that investment fear is not just isolated to the stocks. But as for now, Tom Lee sums it up in a bold, no nonsense manner:",,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/personal-finance-news/citi-bank-bans-credit-debit-card-transactions-for-purchasing-bitcoins-other-cryptocurrencies/articleshow/62900440.cms,"NEW DELHI: While the cloud of uncertainty continues to hover over the legal status cryptocurrencies, seems like financial institutions have already started to take precautions.

Cryptos are not a substitute for stocks, ETFs, or futures, but they can be a great addition for new and experienced traders to their portfolio. Unlike other asset classes, cryptos are unregulated, which presents different opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on them. Let’s explore these differences.

Fewer Limitations

First of all, traders looking to get into the world of cryptocurrency trading will notice a big difference versus stocks on the regulatory side. Stock traders must conform to the Pattern Day Trading (PDT) rule. The PDT rule requires that anybody who wants to day trade maintain a minimum balance of $25,000 in their account. If your balance falls below this level, you are not allowed to day trade. Crypto trading does not have this rule, so traders can open an account with less than $25,000. This allows traders to try out the cryptos without risking a lot of money.

Also, position sizes can be a lot smaller than stocks. Some stockbrokers prohibit odd lot trading (less than 100 shares), and ones that do charge such a high commission that it is next to impossible to make a profit. With crypto trading, fractional trading is very easy as there is really no such thing as a round lot of 100 shares. You can easily trade .042 of Litecoin for example. Again, for getting your feet wet in this new space this offers a big advantage.

Another huge advantage over stocks is that cryptocurrencies trade 24/7. No other market can claim that. Even the forex market closes over the weekend. This allows people with full-time jobs the ability to trade during their non-working hours, and anybody can continue trading after the stock market has closed. Because there is no open or close, cryptos benefit from eliminating one of the major downfalls and dangers of swing trading: gaps. A gap is an opening price that is significantly different from the previous closing price. For example, a stock can close on Tuesday at $30.00, and open Wednesday morning at $22. For a trader that had a position in the stock and had either a mental or real sell stop at $29.50, the result of this gap down would be disastrous. The trader was willing to lose $0.50 on the trade but is now down $8. A few of these could end the career of any trader. With cryptos, there are no gaps. Outside of “fast markets,” stop orders generally get executed where the trader intends them to be executed.

A Clear Market Leader

A market leader sets the tone for the overall direction of the market. For example the FANG stocks (Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)) are four stock that (in general) will set the tone for the sentiment of the NASDAQ. For cryptos, the market leader, by far, is Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes higher, the whole crypto market usually goes higher as well. The opposite is true when Bitcoin sells off. By keeping an eye on the direction on Bitcoin, traders have a roadmap of where the other cryptos might go, and trade accordingly. Although the stock market does have market leaders, the degree that Bitcoin is a leader in the crypto space offers one more advantage of trading the asset class.

Are you faster than a computer? Probably not. Do you have the trading experience and knowledge of Wall Street traders and hedge fund managers? Maybe (or maybe not). Another important advantage crypto trading has over stock, futures, options, and forex trading is the lack of professional traders and high-frequency trading. The crypto trading universe is still in its infancy and is not yet big enough to attract Wall Street traders and computerized trading that can execute 100 trades in the time it takes you to blink. This presents a level playing field for newer traders and a huge advantage for experienced traders looking to transfer their trading skills to cryptos.

Speaking of skills, one of the things that have attracted me to cryptocurrency trading is not having to learn anything new. The same technical analysis tools that I use for stock and futures trading can be applied to crypto trading.

And finally, there is always volatility in crypto trading. As traders, we count on price movement to give us the opportunity to find and enter into profitable trades.

Whether the crypto space is here to stay or disappears in a few years remains to be seen. But as a trading vehicle, cryptos offer advantages over the established capital markets and should be seriously considered for traders looking for additional profits.

Jeff Goldman is the co-author of The Crypto Prophet on the Marketfy platform.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/s-korea-responds-to-public-petition-no-crypto-trading-ban-but-govt-still-divided,"South Korea’s government said its regulatory course on cryptocurrencies is aiming to “prevent any illegal acts or uncertainties” in fresh comments Wednesday, Feb. 14.

Quoted by various media outlets, the country’s minister of the office for government policy coordination Hong Nam-ki released a statement in response to last month’s public petition against harsh regulation or an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading.

The petition, posted on the site of the South Korean presidential office, has to date gathered over 200,000 signatures. The government is obliged to respond to a petition that gathers over 200,000 within 30 days.

“The government’s basic rule is to prevent any illegal acts or uncertainties regarding cryptocurrency trade, while eagerly nurturing blockchain technology,” Hong announced, continuing:

“But, the government is still divided with many opinions ranging from an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading to bringing the institutions that handle the currency into the system.”

The extent of public backlash after Justice Minister Park Sang-ki suggested laws were in the works to ban cryptocurrency exchanges and trading was such that the government as a whole was obliged to clarify its position shortly afterwards.

“There is no intention to ban or suppress cryptocurrency,” finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in statement Jan. 31.

Today’s statement from the government emphasizing the “many opinions” at play makes clear that a final decision has yet to take place in the country.

The statements come just a day after another government source suggested a licensing scheme for crypto exchanges could be established following elections in June this year. The government official noted that the proposed system was modelled on New York’s BitLicense.

In Japan, a similar move to regulate crypto exchanges via a licensing system that began in 2017 is functioning successfully.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-mining-costs-more-electricity-than-houses-but-its-a-non-issue,"Analysts are concerned that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining centers are spending too much electricity, and that the process of verifying cryptocurrency transactions could worsen the global environment.

Justification of mining in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies

In December 2017, several analysts criticized the electricity consumption of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining centers, calling the mining process an “environmental disaster.” Earlier Cointelegraph reported that cryptocurrency mining will likely exceed electricity consumption of households in 2018.

Smari McCarthy of Iceland's Pirate Party stated that excessive consumption for Bitcoin mining is not practical because the main use case of Bitcoin is for “financial speculation.”

""We are spending tens or maybe hundreds of megawatts on producing something that has no tangible existence and no real use for humans outside the realm of financial speculation. That can't be good.”

If environmentalists and analysts perceive the main use case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be financial speculation, the consumption of a massive amount of electricity could be considered impractical. However, the main application of Bitcoin is not financial speculation. In countries wherein the underbanked struggle to gain access to financial services, Bitcoin operates as an efficient currency.

In Venezuela, for instance, local residents are using Bitcoin to order food, basic goods and medicine from outside of the country because the Venezuelan bolivar, the country’s national currency, has lost almost all of its value, and has become virtually worthless.

Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm uses global computing power to verify transactions and produce new cryptocurrencies through a mathematical system. The PoW system of Bitcoin disallows hackers from gaining access to the decentralized protocol and enables the Bitcoin Blockchain network to settle transactions on a peer to peer basis without intermediaries. Hence, to undermine the consumption of electricity to power decentralized currencies that are imposing a major impact on the global economy is illogical, and it is especially ill-judged to claim that the applicability of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology is limited to financial speculation.

Speculation exists in any sector that is in the early stage of growth. In the beginning, investors are going to speculate on the value and price trend of cryptocurrencies and crypto-assets. However, as the industry matures and the market evolves, investors will inevitably move on from speculation to utilization of tokens for utility and fungibility.

Is electricity consumption a problem? Probably the one that market solves

Evidently, electricity costs contribute significantly to the operating costs of mining centers and facilities. As such, cryptocurrency miners focus on reducing its operating costs and maximizing its profit margins by using cheap sources of electricity.

In regions like northeastern China, Peru and Chile, the supply of electricity generated from renewable sources is so abundant that electricity is distributed for free. Chile for instance, in 2016, produced so much solar energy that it had given away most of it for free. Since then, the government of Chile has constructed more solar plants and focused on building infrastructures to generate enough clean electricity to power the entire country without additional costs.

It is important to acknowledge that minimal consumption of nonrenewable and expensive electricity is in the interest and benefit of cryptocurrency miners. It is for this particular reason that many miners have relocated to regions like northeastern China, Chile, Norway and Iceland wherein miners can obtain cheap electricity from renewable sources and naturally cool down their facilities with cold climate.

In Iceland, according to NEA, the National Energy Authority of the country, almost 100 percent of energy and electricity are generated from renewable sources. Hydroelectric power and geothermal energy account for 99.8 percent of Iceland’s electricity. In Norway, another popular country for cryptocurrency miners, hydropower accounts for a staggering 95 percent of electricity generated by the country. In both countries, electricity used by households and facilities are almost entirely generated by clean and renewable energy.

It is beneficial for miners to relocate to countries like Iceland and Norway because cheap electricity substantially decreases operating costs. As such, miners always search for regions with cheaper electricity and as a result, target renewable sources of electricity in countries with abundant supplies of energy. If cryptocurrency miners are using leftover electricity in regions with abundant supplies of renewable electricity, then it is a non-issue for both the miners and the global environment.

In an interview, Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, an HS Orka spokesman, stated that if all cryptocurrency mining facilities relocating to Iceland permanently settle down in the country, the region will not have enough energy to support these centers.

“If all these projects are realized, we won’t have enough energy for it. What we’re seeing now is…you can almost call it exponential growth, I think, in the [energy] consumption of data centers.”

There’s no reason not to believe in that scenario. But let’s not forget how does the market economy functions. If energy becomes expensive in Iceland due to scarcity, cryptocurrency miners will inevitably relocate to other regions with cheaper electricity.",,https://theweek.com/articles/752777/cryptocurrencies-are-making-computers-more-expensive,"Unless you've been hiding under a rock, you've probably noticed the spike in interest in cryptocurrencies.

You can't put it in your pocket like a dollar bill, and most coffee shops won't accept it as payment, but it still has value. Sometimes, a lot of value. For instance, one of the most popular cryptocurrencies is bitcoin, and one bitcoin is currently worth about $8,500.

The cryptocurrency market is huge. According to Forbes, it is worth about $400 billion right now. But it's also incredibly volatile. Bitcoin, for example, recently lost an excruciating 70 percent of its value. It plummeted from a high of $20,000 to below $6,000, and then slowly inched back up to its current position. Since the start of 2018, the entire cryptocurrency market has lost more than $200 billion.

Despite its volatility, cryptocurrency doesn't seem to be going away, and it could be the root of a new financial system that lives entirely in the virtual world.

But the proliferation of cryptocurrencies has another, lesser-known side effect. If you're a PC gamer who is devoted to playing video games on your computer, the crypto market is affecting you indirectly by creating a run on computer parts, and sending the prices of those parts soaring. To understand why, we have to dig deeper into how cryptocurrencies are made. The simple explanation: They're mined online with computers. The slightly more detailed explanation: People use their computers to solve mathematical problems with software, or ""mine"" for cryptocurrency, and they get bitcoins or other virtual currencies in exchange for their work. This is where having the right computer parts is very important. When cryptocurrency ""miners"" realized that graphics cards used by computer-gamers can process information faster, the demand for those graphics processing units (GPUs) skyrocketed, and the problems for gamers began.

What we're currently seeing play out in the computer parts industry is a classic tale of supply and demand. When cryptocurrencies started to rise, and the value of one coin reached thousands of dollars, more people wanted a share of the market. This meant more cryptocurrency miners who needed graphics cards and other expensive computer parts to work, which led to price increases and shortages.

Take a look at Amazon, or another retailer's listed prices for GPUs — if you can find them. Many graphics cards are either temporarily out of stock or sold out entirely. Gaming site Polygon shares that the price of one graphics card, called the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070, jumped from $380 to $700 in a year. Here's another example: MSI's GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming X is supposed to cost $459.99, but the actual price varies from $919.99 to $988.99. Some crypto miners aren't shy about their conquests: They brag about emptying out store shelves, and show off their loot on Instagram. One miner proudly shared a photo of eight graphics cards they'd just bought, topping $7,000 in value.

The average computer user who rarely ventures beyond their email inbox, Google, or Facebook probably won't feel the price crunch, but anyone who relies on graphics cards for hobbies or work certainly will. That includes video editors and graphic designers, who often need fast GPUs for their work. And you don't have to be a pro designer to feel this pain: Some basic Photoshop features require a GPU to work properly.

In a perfect world, there would be enough graphics cards to go around. In reality, some companies are going to extreme lengths to prevent miners from hoarding GPUs. For instance, they're putting caps on orders and prioritizing gamers over miners. And a few are offering gamers special discounts. Micro Center, which sells computer parts, proudly displays its commitment to giving gamers more discounts with prices ""well below the market,"" if they're bundling parts.

For now, gamers and miners will have to keep fighting over GPUs and stalking retailer sites to get their hands on them. Desperate cryptocurrency miners are going after any GPUs they can find, which means neither expensive nor low-end cards are safe. The companies that manufacture the parts can't keep up with demand, and so far, no one has promised to increase supply, so it's likely the rush on GPUs will continue.

But there's one ray of hope for gamers and PC users: The cryptocurrency market is still volatile, with drastic ups and downs, to be predictable or stable. This lack of stability may keep new miners away and give GPU companies a chance to recover and restock. And it may just give gamers a break.",2018-02-14 05:50:01-05:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/citibank-india-to-not-permit-card-customers-purchasing-or-trading-crypto/,"Citibank India to Not Permit Card Customers Purchasing or Trading Crypto

Citibank India notified debit card and credit card clients via email on the 13:th of February they would no longer be able to participate in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Citing regional and global concerns from regulators, the over a century old institution is following a growing number of traditional banks in cutting off access to the decentralized currency.

Citibank India Bans Bitcoin

“Given concerns,” Citibank India informed its customers in an email Tuesday, “both globally and locally including from the Reserve Bank of India, cautioning members of the public regarding the potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks associated in dealing with bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies, Citi India has decided to not permit usage of its credit and debit cards towards purchase or trading of such bitcoins, cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies.”

Bank of America, Lloyds Banking Group, JP Morgan Chase have also forbade cryptocurrency purchase for their customers, though they haven’t a retail presence in India. Recently, Visa pulled its European support for crypto, and Mastercard has elected to treat crypto purchases as cash advances. Citibank India has been around since 1902, and is counted among the largest foreign investors while operating over thirty brick and mortar outlets and over 500 automatic teller machines in the region. Among the top five cards, it is the only multinational bank.

Last month, banks in India such as HDFC, Axis, Yes Bank, SBI, and ICICI Bank pulled their support of bitcoin and crypto exchanges for customers. Combined with Arun Jaitley, Indian Finance Minister, delivering a budget speech where it was reiterated cryptocurrencies will not be recognized as legal tender, and it’s easy to see why Citibank India might’ve been spooked.

Mr. Jaitley warned, “The Government does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.”

Kotak Mahindra Bank Drops Bitcoin as Well

Kotak Mahindra Bank has also announced it will not allow its customers to dabble in crypto. It has over a thousand branches in India, with over two thousand ATMs, making it the fourth largest bank in the country.

The bank warned any type of crypto activity noticed on accounts would be immediate grounds for closure.

Coinbase, a company that houses people's digital wallets for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, has a new way to pay.

The service, called Coinbase Commerce, ""enables merchants to accept multiple cryptocurrencies"" so funds arrive directly in their own wallets. It can be integrated straight into their own online checkout processes, Coinbase said in a blog post Wednesday.

Bitcoin rose to prominence as a digital currency, but many today are cautious since its value has been highly volatile, transaction times are slow, transaction fees have been increasing, and many people bought cryptocurrencies not to spend it but to hang on in hopes its worth would continue to skyrocket.

""Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange... This has led to Bitcoin becoming less useful for payments,"" payment processor Stripe said in January of its decision to stop accepting bitcoin payments.

Coinbase didn't immediately detail transaction fees or transaction times for Coinbase Commerce.

There are hundreds of other cryptocurrencies now besides bitcoin, perhaps most notably the Ethereum Project's ether given its more advanced blockchain-based smart contract technology, but it isn't fast at transactions either. Coinbase Commerce can accept bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin. It's integrated already with Shopify for those using that e-commerce technology.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-crypto-69-million-2017-fidelity-charitable,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have proved quite charitable, at least as far as Fidelity Charitable is concerned.

Announced today, the global charity revealed it has received $69 million in cryptocurrency donations in 2017, making it the fastest-growing asset type accepted by the firm. According to Fidelity Charitable’s annual report, the funds, which included donations in bitcoin and ether, came from 169 different donors.

The donations represent a tenfold increase since the organization started accepting bitcoin in late 2015, a figure that grew 140 percent faster than the other options (such as real estate, shares of LLCs and bags of grain) that Fidelity Charitable accepts as donations, according to the company’s vice president Amy Pirozzolo.

Pirozzolo told CoinDesk:

“It is one of the fastest growing assets that we are seeing wanting to be contributed to charity. Many people who own bitcoin or other forms of cryptocurrency do want to be philanthropic.”

But if that comes as a surprise, perhaps it shouldn’t – donations have been one of the key use cases from cryptocurrency since the beginning.

In 2013, non-profit BitGive began helping other non-profits accept donations in bitcoin and shortly after, a handful of major names announced they would trial the idea. The following year, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase launched its own service designed to support non-profits.

Now, a cottage industry of consultants like Man on a Mission Consulting have popped up to streamline the process of allowing charities to accept this new type of value.

According to Man on a Mission founder Paul Lamb, “I think there’s a strong desire to accept not only bitcoin, but other cryptocurrencies as well, so it’s really a matter of building it and providing a menu of options from fiat to the wide range of cryptocurrencies.”

Explosive growth

But Fidelity Charitable is also an early adopter of sorts.

The charity arm of the multinational investment firm first started accepting cryptocurrency through Coinbase’s charity service in November 2015, but until this year, it didn’t really see the funding mechanism take off. During 2016, its first year full-year of acceptance, crypto donations accounted for only $7 million.

However, throughout the first half of 2017, the firm engaged in a marketing campaign designed to increase the visibility of the service, resulting in 40 articles and a total of $11 million-worth of donations, according to Pirozzolo, who is also the head of Fidelity Charitable’s marketing efforts.

“As that took hold – and we created a web page for people to understand how you can donate this, and started buying paid search behind this, and got more mainstream media coverage and more social coverage – this whole thing really took off,” she said.

By November, the total donated had doubled to $22 million, momentum that coincided with a tweet that same month from early bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, who said he had used the platform.

While it’s impossible to correlate funding changes directly to the tweet, the following month, Fidelity received an additional $36 million-worth of crypto donations.

Tax incentive

Still, all this isn’t to say that more traditional donation types are at risk of being overshadowed by blockchain-based assets anytime soon.

According to a statement from the company, the cryptocurrency asset class falls within the broader category of non-publicly traded assets, which accounted for $1 billion dollars-worth of donations last year. That, in turn, fell within an even broader pool of $4.5 billion-worth of total donations.

The biggest draw to Fidelity Charitable’s platform is what’s called an investor-managed fund, which lets donors give away assets including cryptocurrency without having to pay capital gains taxes.

The result is that the total amount received by the organization typically increases relative to the donor’s tax bracket. And given that a total of 127,000 non-profits received funds from Fidelity last year, this extra money could eventually make an even bigger impact.

Pirozzolo concluded:

“This is a great win-win for both [donors] as well as the charities.”

O'Leary told CNBC Make It in December that there is a big problem among bitcoin investors: ""I'm quite sure that 99 percent of the people that own bitcoin do not understand how it works."" ""That always is a cocktail for disaster,"" he says. The first thing O'Leary says you need to understand about bitcoin is that it is an asset, not a currency. By that he means that the quick and sudden gains or drops in value — known as volatility — make it difficult to use as an actual currency in transactions. He explains it like this: When O'Leary recently tried to do a roughly $200,000 deal in bitcoin, the other party would only agree if he was willing to guarantee the value of the bitcoin against the price of the U.S. dollar, for fear it would fluctuate before the transaction was complete. ""If clearly neither side thinks it is stable enough to transfer in one minute, and they don't even want to take one minute of risk, it is not a currency,"" he says.

This is part of ""Blockchain Decoded,"" a series looking at the impact of blockchain, bitcoin and cryptocurrency on our lives.

Ever the tech enthusiast, Bert Green decided to start accepting bitcoin at his Chicago storefront in 2013, becoming one of the first art galleries in the US to accept the digital currency as payment.

Things didn't work out as planned.

""It's hardly ever happened,"" he said, recalling just two sales using the cryptocurrency over the past four years at his gallery, Bert Green Fine Art. ""People do not transact in bitcoin.""

Green's experience isn't unique. Despite bitcoin and other digital currencies being billed as -- you know -- currencies, they've instead turned into investment vehicles or stores of wealth. That shift appears to have sped up last year, when bitcoin's price skyrocketed from $1,000 last February to nearly $20,000 by December -- causing cryptocurrency to become a topic at the family dinner table.

This lack of spending with cryptocurrencies could limit their future potential. Bitcoin, ethereum and other digital currencies may remain in the realm of investors and crypto enthusiasts, instead of becoming long-sought universal monies that people use every day and can be spent at any store or website around the world.

Even after bitcoin's price tumbled this year, chances that it could reach that promise are anyone's guess.

""That is the $64,000 question, that is, what's the next narrative for bitcoin?"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of the independent research firm DataTrek Research, who's been following cryptocurrencies since 2012. ""It's really hard to pin down and that's why the price is so volatile.""

The headaches of bitcoin lunch

Things weren't always this way. Back in 2013, bitcoin was being trumpeted as the next, new currency, unfettered by governments, easily movable across borders and anonymous for users.

Looking to take part in this new concept, Kashmir Hill, now a senior reporter in San Francisco for Gizmodo Media Group, spent a week that year living solely on bitcoin, writing about her experience for Forbes. It was a giant pain just finding retailers that would accept the currency.

She did the same experiment a year later and found more retailers accepted the digital tokens, but she bumped up against plenty of other problems. One day, she tried to buy lunch at a local market that accepted bitcoin. Her payment didn't go through so she left starving, she said. The transaction completed about two hours later and she had to go back the next day to get her meal.

""In my experience, bitcoin was so annoying that it was hard to imagine it becoming easier than going to the local ATM and getting money,"" she said.

In another situation, Hill said she bought a bunch of strangers dinner at a sushi restaurant in 2013 for 10 bitcoin, the equivalent at the time of $1,200. The price of those bitcoin today would be roughly $93,000.

""I just don't know how I could again spend this currency that could be worth so much more,"" she added. ""I think I would be going crazy while doing it.""

Hill's experiment revealed a bunch of annoyances with spending with bitcoin. It's only accepted in a small fraction of retailers, and using it to buy stuff isn't all that simple, often requiring sending funds from one digital wallet to another using an online address called a public key. Plus, cryptocurrency fans don't want to part with their digital tokens for fear they'll miss out on the next big run-up in prices.

One of the best-known examples of missed opportunities with bitcoin came from one of the earliest transactions using the currency. In 2010, when bitcoin was worth a fraction of a penny, Florida software programmer Laszlo Hanyecz agreed to pay someone 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's pizzas.

""Those are the two most expensive pizzas in the history of the planet,"" Colas said. (This week, they'd be worth approximately $93 million -- or $46.5 million per pie.)

With so few people agreeing to part ways with their bitcoin, some retailers have stopped accepting it. The gaming company Valve in December said it would stop taking the currency on its Steam service, citing its high fees and volatility. OKCupid, too, dropped bitcoin, saying a tiny percentage of people used it on the dating site.

The e-retailer Overstock.com started accepting bitcoin in 2013 and now takes dozens of cryptocurrencies as payment, including Dash, Monero and litecoin. Despite that, the company said roughly 0.25 percent of its revenue comes from purchases using cryptocurrencies.

Julian Plyter, co-founder and CEO of the Manhattan ice-cream sandwich shop Melt, said his business has made just 75 transactions with bitcoin between 2014 and 2017. But, he added, many of those transactions were with journalists curious how bitcoin buying works.

Better on the dark web

Slow bitcoin sales aren't a drag for everyone, though. Lior Rachmany, CEO of Dumbo Moving in Brooklyn, started accepting bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin a few months ago.

While these crypto-sales make up just 5 percent of his business, he likes using digital money because transactions are irreversible, ensuring he'll get paid for a move without fear a customer will charge back the transaction. Plus, past moves have the potential of accruing in value as bitcoin prices rise and some international customers found it easier to use, he said.

He's now planning on selling some of his company's crypto reserves for cash to stock up on equipment ahead of the summer moving season.

""I think that's the way of the future, less politics behind the money,"" Rachmany said. ""And I think everybody should get on it.""

These benefits for retailers, of course, can also be seen as disincentives for consumers.

""It's a final transaction. It's like handing someone cash on the sidewalk,"" Green said.

Now playing: Watch this: What the heck is blockchain?

One area that bitcoin is still regularly used for transactions is the dark web. Thanks to the currency's anonymity, it's found a following for money laundering, murder for hire, drugs and ransomware.

On a daily basis, an estimated 20 percent of overall bitcoin transfers -- roughly $50 million to $60 million -- are for illicit activity, according to Lance Morginn, CEO of Blockchain Intelligence Group, a Vancouver-based company that tracks suspicious bitcoin activity.

That reputation of being tied to illegal activities is another hurdle for bitcoin in reaching the mainstream. Morginn, whose clients include the US Department of Justice, said his company is working to cut down on that problem. In the future, he suggested, the currency may need to become less anonymous to thrive.

Green, the art gallery owner, stocked up on some bitcoin in the early days and now tends to use his reserves the same way as most other crypto fans. At times, he's traded it a bit between different cryptocurrencies and when business is slow he'll sell some to make ends meet. But for the most part he just holds onto it.""

""I'm not spending it,"" he said. ""I'm not using it for stuff, because I see a long-term value in holding it.""

Malware that surreptitiously mines cryptocurrency while you browse the web is big news right now – literally in the case of news outlet Salon, which has enabled it as an opt-in feature. One thing that it certainly isn’t, though, is big business. Every other day, media outlets seem to be running stories about the latest cryptojacking scams. While these tales are mostly true, the extent of the problem has been vastly overstated. Smart criminals aren’t covertly crypto mining in-browser, not because they’re incapable of doing so, but because even at scale it simply isn’t profitable.

Cryptojacking Malware

Last weekend, it emerged that the Browse Aloud web browser plugin had been hijacked, causing it to covertly mine cryptocurrency on around 5,000 computers. Among those affected were systems used by a number of British government bodies including the National Health Service and a student loans company. At the time, a spokesperson for the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre said: “NCSC technical experts are examining data involving incidents of malware being used to illegally mine cryptocurrency…Government websites will continue to operate securely. At this stage there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk.”

Naturally members of the public weren’t at risk – in any sense of the word. The only real side effects of having your browsing session cryptojacked are perhaps a slowdown in computing performance and the device heating up. The majority of web users wouldn’t even be aware that anything was amiss. While relatively benign, as cyber attacks go, mining malware is still an inconvenience that no web user would reasonably be expected to tolerate…except for instances where that was the price of access. Salon sparked headlines this week after unveiling plans to do just that as a means of monetizing its news site.

Mining for Kernels of Truth

Media organizations are constantly seeking new ways of monetizing their sites. In an era of ad blockers and diminishing attention spans, generating any sort of payment per click is an achievement. The notion of web users mining monero – an anonymous cryptocurrency synonymous with the deep web and its wares – in order to fund a mainstream news site is an amusing one. It’s also an illogical one, on many levels. According to estimates provided by Coinhive, the software used by Salon as well as by the criminals in last weekend’s UK-wide cyberjacking scam, the return to be made on browser mining is pitiful.

One million visitors spending five minutes on a website would result in a total of $64 of monero being mined. The 5,000 UK government machines that were infected using Coinhive netted a paltry $24 in monero. Browser mining cryptocurrency, be it on a permissioned or permissionless basis, is unprofitable. If you’re going to bend the rules to mine crypto, you need access to a government supercomputer and the skills to avoid getting caught. Otherwise, the juice simply isn’t worth the squeeze.

After gamers, scientists have now raised the alarm about the deficit of video cards caused by excessive demand in the crypto mining industry. Researchers trying to pick up radio signals from stars and extraterrestrials say they need more of the latest GPU chips for their data processing equipment. According to media reports, a leading manufacturer may soon offer a graphics card dedicated for mining to mitigate shortages.

Also read: AMD Increases GPU Production to Match Crypto Mining Demand

Efforts to Eavesdrop on ETs Impeded

Radio-astronomers working on SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) projects said they need more GPUs to upgrade their equipment. The scientists want to expand operations at two observatories but cannot find enough of the new powerful chips, BBC reported. Some telescopes need about 100 graphics cards to process data from large listening arrays. They are used to detect signals from space, some of which may be emitted by other civilizations.

Demand for graphics processing units has soared in recent months and cryptocurrency miners have been blamed for the shortages. Investors buy in bulk the latest GPUs on the market, which can process more crypto transactions and return higher profits. Cards are used in mining rigs mainly for altcoins like ethereum and monero. Bitcoin mining requires a certain processing capacity and is performed by specialized hardware.

“We’d like to use the latest GPUs, and we can’t get them”, said Dan Werthimer, chief scientist at the University of California, Berkeley SETI Research Center. “We want to look at as many frequency channels as we possibly can. We don’t know what frequency ET will be broadcasting on – is it AM or FM, what communication are they using? That takes a lot of computing power”, Dr Werthimer explained.

The scientists have been trying to improve the analyzing capacity of equipment installed at two SETI observatories – Green Bank in West Virginia and Parkes in Australia. However, their efforts have been impeded by the GPU shortages. “We’ve got the money, we have contacted the vendors, and they say they just don’t have them”, Dan Werthimer told the BBC. Telescopes used by radio-astronomers are able to pick up the faintest of radio frequencies in the universe. SETI scientists are constantly listening out for broadcasts by aliens, but the arrays are also detecting signals emitted by natural phenomena.

What about Star Gazing?

The tight GPU market has hit other radio-astronomers, too. A team of scientists looking for evidence of the earliest stars in the universe was recently shocked by the doubled prices of graphics cards. Researchers operating the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (Hera) in South Africa have received a grant from the US National Science Foundation to upgrade the telescope but found they could afford fewer units.

Hera is a joint project between the US, the UK and the Republic of South Africa. Its equipment uses GPUs to combine data from many small radio telescopes to offer a much wider field of view. The price of the processing units has doubled in just three months to $1,000 USD. “We are buying a lot of these things, it’s going to end up costing about $32,000 extra”, said Aaron Parsons, professor at the UC Berkeley. The team will have to use some of its contingency budget to acquire all the cards it needs.

Addressing the Deficit

Major graphics cards manufacturers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have recognized the shortages and taken steps to address the issue. AMD announced plans to increase production after the recently launched RX Vega GPUs virtually disappeared from store shelves. The company said its Radeon cards were in short supply and acknowledged that demand for mining applications was responsible for the shortfall. AMD promised to produce more of the powerful chips to satisfy all of its customers.

Nvidia, AMD’s main competitor, has moved to ensure video gamers have a chance to get hold of its video processors asking retailers to limit the number of cards purchased at a time. The company admitted that cryptocurrency mining demand had exceeded its expectations in the last quarter of 2017. It has been reported that Nvidia may reveal a new card aimed at the crypto mining market in March. According to media speculations, the GPU is codenamed “Turing” after the British computer scientist and cryptanalyst Alan Turing.

Both companies have recorded rising revenues in Q4 of last year. AMD announced $1.48 billion USD of revenue with $958 million coming from its Computing and Graphics division. Sales of graphics cards like Vega 56 and Vega 64 have played a major role in reaching a 60% year-on-year increase there. Nvidia has reported revenue of $2.91 billion, up 34% from $2.17 billion a year earlier. Strong demand from cryptocurrency miners has been mentioned as an important factor.

The Commodities Futures Trading Commission said in a statement that it had received complaints from investors who had lost money in such schemes, and warned against buying cryptocurrencies based on tips found on social media.

“As with many online frauds, this type of scam is not new - it simply deploys an emerging technology to capitalize on public interest in digital assets,” CFTC director of public affairs Erica Elliott Richardson said in the statement.

The CFTC’s warning comes as financial regulators worldwide intensify their scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, which are virtual coins not backed by governments. Cryptocurrency trading has been booming over the past year, with the price of coins such as bitcoin and ethereum hitting record levels in volatile markets.

Bitcoin topped $10,000 on Thursday for the first time in more than two weeks, as investors bought the digital currency after it had fallen 70 percent from its record peak in December.BTC=BTSP

Cryptocurrencies are traded on largely unregulated and anonymous online exchanges, many of which have been plagued by problems such as hacks and technical glitches. The CFTC considers bitcoin a commodity and has anti-fraud and manipulation enforcement authority over virtual currency markets.

Cryptocurrency “pump-and-dump” schemes are generally carried out anonymously on public chatrooms or on mobile chat apps.

In the “pump” phase, organizers typically post fake or misleading information enticing other investors to buy a token and thus inflate its price. The organizers then quickly sell their holdings of that token - the “dump” - and make a profit at the expense of other investors.

“The price falls and victims are left with currency or tokens that are worth much less than what they expected,” the CFTC said in its statement.

The CFTC has been expanding its reach over cryptocurrencies, having authorized two large U.S. exchanges to list bitcoin futures late last year.

At a Senate hearing this month, CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo noted that the regulator was focused on cracking down on manipulation of cryptocurrency markets.

“What we will do and we are doing is looking for fraud and manipulation,” Giancarlo said. “And we intend to be very aggressive.”",2018-02-15 20:25:11+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/15/17017374/coinbase-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ether-unauthorized-charges,"A growing number of Coinbase customers are complaining that the cryptocurrency exchange withdrew unauthorized money out of their accounts. In some cases, this drained their linked bank accounts below zero, resulting in overdraft charges.

In a typical anecdote posted on Reddit, one user said they purchased Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin for a total of $300 on February 9th. A few days later, the transactions repeated five times for a total of $1,500, even though the user had not made any more purchases. That was enough to clear out this user’s bank account, they said, resulting in fees.

“My bank account went from very comfortable to negatives balance, not to mention extra $5 charges, and overdraft fees,” the user wrote. “As a result my rent check bounced, and my bank went further into negative for a NSF charge for $25. My landlord is not a nice person and is on my CASE and I have nothing to offer him. I am FREAKING OUT.”

Coinbase representatives have been responding to similar complaints on Reddit for about two weeks, but the volume of complaints seems to have spiked over the last 24 hours. Similar complaints have popped up on forums and Twitter.

“I am FREAKING OUT.”

At the time of writing, the front page of the r/Coinbase subreddit mostly consisted of similar complaints: “You drained my bank account and now I have nothing.” “Calling for a class action lawsuit.” “What’s going on, should I be worried?” “DOUBLE CHARGED, WITHDRAWALS POSTED WHAT THE FUCK.” “Coinbase randomly took 100 dollars out of my bank?” “Welp officially broke, charged 17x1000$ on my account.”

The issue started after a change occurred in the way credit cards classify digital currency transactions, according to a statement on Reddit from a Coinbase employee on February 4th. At that time, Coinbase was still trying to identify the issue. Users were asked to comment publicly on the thread with information about their double charges, including their bank and dates of transactions. (The tactic was immediately criticized for being a security risk.)

This morning, February 15th, another Coinbase employee wrote on Reddit that “the unexpected charges are originating outside of our control, and are related to charges from previous purchases.” The charges are in the process of being refunded, the employee wrote, although he did not say whether resulting overdraft charges would also be refunded. “We are running joint investigations with all parties involved, and will provide updates as we receive them,” he wrote.

Pete Kingree, a Coinbase user in Virginia, provided a screenshot of what he said were unauthorized charges to Coinbase totaling $931 with an additional $7.45 in bank fees. “I am writing the Coinbase CEO, OCC, Barbara Comstock (my representative), and the Governor of Virginia,” he said in an email.

Another Coinbase user, Mike Baldesarra, provided a screenshot from his bank showing repeated transactions totaling nearly $300. One charge was credited back to his account after 12 days, but then his account was hit with another phantom duplicate charge, which has not been refunded yet. Coinbase also did not refund him for the overdraft charges he incurred, he said, and he received form letters in response to the complaints he filed through customer service. Others had experienced greater losses, he said in an email, but he wanted to share his story “so others like myself aren’t caught off guard and left without money in their accounts.”

He wanted to share his story “so others like myself aren’t caught off guard and left without money in their accounts”

The problem appears to be that legitimate charges are duplicated without authorization, and it appears to affect specific banks including Scotiabank and USAA, judging by user complaints. “Today I had a talk with my bank (Scotiabank) about the double charges I received from coinbase on my visa debit card,” one Reddit user wrote. “They said that this trend has been going on for two weeks and they are closely monitoring it.”

Coinbase, the San Francisco-based wallet and exchange startup that raised more than $225 million from venture capital investors, serves as the layman’s introduction to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Many popular exchanges such as Binance only allow users to trade between virtual currencies, but Coinbase is one of a few reputable shops that allow users to hook up their bank accounts and buy virtual currencies with fiat (government-backed) money including the US dollar, euro, and British pound sterling. For that reason, it’s the go-to site for purchasing cryptocurrencies; Google “How to buy Bitcoin,” and you’ll get a CNBC article explaining how to use Coinbase.

However, the company is still new, and stories about disappearing account balances could damage its reputation.

“I probably will never use their service again.”

Joel Hirtle, a Coinbase customer who banks with Scotiabank, was hit with two phantom charges for $100, the first of which sent his bank account into the negative and resulted in a total of $144 in overdraft fees, he told The Verge. He opened five different support tickets with Coinbase, he said, and spoke to customer service twice. While the first $100 phantom charge was automatically refunded, the second $100 charge appeared at midnight last night. “I go to it instantly and sure enough it’s Coinbase taking money from my account yet again,” he said. He said he is doubtful that Coinbase will refund his overdraft fees because his experience with its customer service team was so poor. He canceled his debit card because he was afraid of being erroneously charged by Coinbase again. “I don’t trust them to hold my money, that’s for sure,” he said. “I probably will never use their service again.”

Coinbase declined to comment on how many users are affected, what the underlying cause of the problem is, and whether it will refund overdraft charges resulting from its duplicate transactions. “We’re aware of the issue and will be posting updates via Reddit, Twitter and our company blog,” a spokesperson said in an email. “We’ll be reaching out to affected users to solve the issue as required, as well as posting updates via social channels.”

This isn’t the first time Coinbase has double-charged its customers. The company had a similar issue in May 2016.

The company has had a busy week: it temporarily halted PayPal withdrawals, disabled adding new credit cards as a payment option for U.S. customers, and released a new product for merchants called Coinbase Commerce — all as the price of a bitcoin hit $10,000 again after falling for almost two months.",2018-02-15,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7705641e-e5b1-4400-8fd2-b559254907ce,"Introduction

During the Budget speech, 2018 the Government announced that it would take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system.[1] After the country has been resonating the Finance Minister’s statement on cryptocurrencies not being legal tender in India, there has been considerable curiosity about fate of Bitcoins.

Money is an accepted medium of exchange. A currency is an accepted form of money in a particular country and a crypto currency is a form of currency wherein encryption techniques are used to regulate its generation. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a payment system which operates through a peer-to-peer technology. It was launched in the year 2009 by a person or entity by the name of ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’. This currency operates through a system of codes which uses complex and cryptographic code in its design. One of the most striking characteristics of Bitcoin may be the fact that it is not regulated by any central authority or banks. It is therefore, not limited by Geographical boundaries. The network itself as a community issues Bitcoin. For this, it uses complex and cryptographic code in its design. Bitcoin is created through a system called mining, which has been designed in such a way that the maximum number of Bitcoins that can ever be created is 21 million.[2]

Technology used in Bitcoins:

Bitcoin makes use of the Block chain technology. A block chain is more or less an incorruptible digital ledger that can be programmed to record details of financial and non-financial transactions. The whole ledger is completely transparent for every person in the network.[3]

In recent years, virtual currency has attracted the attention of many in India in terms of its usage and the identity and form that it holds. Amongst the multiple digital currencies in the world, one can safely call it to be the fastest growing and widely used category of money known as cryptocurrency.

Legal position of Bitcoin in India

As of present, the position and legal status of Bitcoins vary from country to country. In many cases, it is still undefined and changing in many of them. Bitcoin is in a stage where some countries have explicitly allowed its use and trade, while others have banned or restricted it. Let us look into the position of Bitcoins with reference to India.

1. Applicability of Coinage Act, 2011

Coins in India are governed by the Coinage Act, 2011. Section 2(a): ""coin"" means any coin which is made of any metal or any other material stamped by the Government or any other authority empowered by the Government in this behalf and which is a legal tender including commemorative coin and the Government of India one rupee note.

From the above definition, it is clear that bitcoin being a virtual currency lacking the sanction of the appropriate authority in India, does not fall under the ambit of coins under the Coinage Act.

2. Applicability of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999

So far as Bitcoin is concerned, one must look into the provisions of FEMA to see whether Bitcoin can be considered as a currency or not. For this, we take a look at section 2 (m) which deals with foreign currency, section 2 (q), which deals with Indian currency and section 2 (h) which deals with currency. Perusal of these provisions would show that cryptocurrency or in other words virtual currency is nowhere covered in the definitions. Hence FEMA, presently is not applicable when it comes to the regulation of Bitcoins in India, which further implies that the Reserve Bank of India (hereinafter referred as ‘RBI’) at this stage is unable to regulate Bitcoins and its operations.

3. Applicability of KYC

KYC means “Know Your Customer”[4]. It is a process by which banks obtain information about the identity and the address of its customers. The KYC procedure is meant to be undertaken by the banks while opening its customers’ accounts. In India, KYC Norms are set by the RBI as banks are required to continuously monitor their customers’ transactions, keep an up-to-date record of their identity, and take appropriate steps in case any of the transactions of a customer break from his or her usual pattern of behavior.

One of the most prominent Bitcoin wallet/app in India, Zebpay, while following the KYC and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) norms, adheres to a self-regulation[5] structure at present. This provides the need to attract the applicability of the provisions of the Prevention of Money laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA), in order to ensure and secure that individuals or organisations do not use these platforms for illegal purposes.

4. Applicability of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930

There is a possibility that Bitcoins may be considered as ‘goods’ as per section 2 (7) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. But in situations where Bitcoins are used as consideration, this Act will not apply since consideration can only be in the form of price as per section 2 (10) of the Sale of Goods Act, which is regulated by an existing law and not otherwise i.e., consideration cannot be in kind under Sale of Goods Act. The applicability of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, could also be considered if the transactions between parties are formed by lawful consideration.

5. Taxability of Bitcoin in India

Since coming into prominence in the Indian market, Bitcoin has been raising questions as to its taxability as per the Indian taxation law. Keeping this in mind, both the central and state governments levy taxes. When taxation is on income, it may be on Bitcoin representing such income or on Bitcoin representing asset value.

Bitcoin may be treated as capital assets under section 2 (14)[6] of the Income Tax Act, 1961, which talks about properties and securities held by an assessee. Further, any profit or gain arising from the transfer and sale of an asset, i.e., Bitcoin, may be treated as income or capital gain under the Income Tax Act, thereby making it taxable.

6. Contribution of the RBI and Supreme Court of India

The RBI vide its press release 2017-2018/1530[7] dated December 5, 2017, has restated the concern over the usage and flow of virtual/ digital currency including Bitcoins, by drawing the attention of public to its earlier own press release 2016-17/2054[8] dated February 1, 2017, wherein it was clarified that it has not given any license/ authorization to any entity/ company to operate such virtual currency. Further, it was also clearly stated that any user, holder, trader, investor etc., will be doing business solely at their own risk.

The Supreme Court of India also recently issued a notice[9] to the Ministries of Finance, Law and Justice, Information Technology, and market regulators including the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the RBI after hearing a Public Interest Litigation (Writ Petition[10] (Civil) no.1076 of 2017) under Article 32 of the Constitution against the Union of India filed by Adv. Dwaipayan Bhowmick seeking a regulatory framework to be laid down on virtual currency and wanted that the virtual currency be made accountable by the exchequer.

Conclusion

Bitcoin in India as seen from above still has a long way to go in terms of its regulations under the existing Indian laws. But given the broad spectrum and opportunity that it holds for the people, the market and the economy as a whole, while considering the inadequacies it may pose in terms of its value through the course of time and security threat that any virtual currency may hold, it is upon the Indian Government to implement regulatory frameworks for the smooth operation of Bitcoin, which does not compromise and restrict its movement and transactions.",,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43070849,"""These are the first cases we have seen, and we expect to see many more. There will also be those divorces where a spouse may not have disclosed such assets, leaving a traceability nightmare,"" she said.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-tax-filing-service-says-only-004-of-customers-reported-crypto-to-irs-for-2017,"Fewer than 100 out of 250,000 citizens, or 0.04 percent, who have filed federal tax returns this year to date via personal finance service Credit Karma reported cryptocurrency transactions to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Reuters reported Tuesday Feb. 13.

Credit Karma Tax General Manager Jagjit Chawla said that the company was not surprised about such a small amount of cryptocurrency filers, since citizens “with more complex tax situations” usually tend to file later in the tax season. However, Chawla added that considering the rise of cryptocurrencies in 2017, the company “would expect more people to be reporting”.

The US 2018 tax filing season began Jan. 29 and the deadline to submit 2017 tax returns is April 17.

The IRS, which started providing guidance for taxation of Bitcoin in March 2014, treats cryptocurrency as property. As such, the IRS considers the purchase, sale, trade, and mining of cryptocurrency as taxable events.

Independent cryptocurrency trader Brandon Williams told CNBC that it would be more reasonable for him to treat cryptocurrencies as currencies, since property status is “almost a deterrent in [the] pursuit of mainstream adoption”.

According to Williams, the tiny amount of cryptocurrency tax filings reported by Credit Karma points out “the difficulty in accurately reporting your crypto gains and losses"". Williams said that with more than two cryptocurrency tradings a day, it takes at least three or four hours every two weeks to record trading gains and losses, taking into consideration volumes and volatility.",

For generation X-ers, old enough to remember a time when photographs were analogue and games consoles were 16-bit, brands such as Kodak and Atari evoke fuzzy nostalgia. Nothing perfect lasts forever though, and those companies which once dominated their respective spheres have not aged well. Many assumed these 80s stalwarts had already given up the ghost amidst growing financial problems. As it turns out, not only are the Kodaks and Ataris of the world still limping on, but they’re seeking an injection of new blood and fresh capital in the form of an ICO (Initial Coin Offering).

The Childhood Companies Coming for Your Crypto

Kodak’s descent from photographic giant to failed firm desperately trying to find its niche is a sad one for anyone old enough to associate the name with better times. In the pre-digital age, companies such as Kodak and Atari were mainstays of popular culture. Times change and the companies that fail to innovate get left behind. Kodak’s sudden transformation into crypto miner and ICO entrant has already been picked apart. Atari’s has attracted less scrutiny, but bears many of the same hallmarks.

In 2013, Atari filed for bankruptcy which, coincidentally, was the same year that Kodak followed suit. Five years on and Atari is throwing its hat into the blockchain ring. The pattern is a predictable one now: company trading on former glories announces ICO. Stock leaps by over 50%. Reality settles in. Stock tumbles. The company once synonymous with such classic games as Space Invaders, Pac-Man, and Asteroids is now seeking to establish a reputation as a cryptocurrency pioneer, powered by its Atari Token.

You Nostalgia, You Lose

Brands are obliged to move with the times. The alternative is extinction. Thus it would be unrealistic to expect Atari to base its core business model around churning out retro consoles, just as it would be unrealistic to expect Kodak to turn a profit from selling photographic film. The entry of these brands into the crypto space is not in itself a cause for concern or recipe for mockery. Rather, it’s the way in which these firms have gripped onto this outstretched branch in a bid to break their fall that invites scepticism.

Investment research firm Kerrisdale Capital savaged Kodak’s proposed ICO, branding it “worthless” and the last grasp of a “dying relic of American manufacturing”. Little is known about Atari’s proposed cryptocurrency, other than that the company’s CEO Frederic Chesnais was quoted as saying: “Blockchain technology is poised to take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize, the current economic ecosystem, especially in the areas of the video game industry and online transactions”.

Until more information emerges, Atari deserves the benefit of the doubt. It is hard to shake the feeling though that these companies are less interested in blockchain’s disruptive potential than its ability to prop up their balance sheets. Beware of faded brands coming for your crypto and tainting your childhood memories into the bargain.

Mr Lee, a managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, stated that based on the cryptocurrencies 22 corrections since 2010, bitcoin will hit a new “record peak” in July. He noted: “During bull periods, bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the duration of the decline and imply that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs—this is July 2018.” The strategist claimed that cryptocurrencies will have a strong year but declared that the most renown and highest valued coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum will dominate the market. A chief market analyst at FX brokerage Centtrip, Miles Eakers, insisted that the sharp increase in Bitcoin “coincided” with the “rally in global stock markets”.

However, Yves Mersch, an executive board member at the European Central Bank, issued a stark warning to investors that cryptocurrencies could “become worthless at any time” and that Bitcoin is not a currency but is instead a “speculative digital asset”. In the last week, Bitcoin has added $2,004.33 (£1420.47) to its value that is equivalent to a 24.31 per cent rise, according to Coinbase. At the time of writing the cryptocurrency is worth $10,250.01 (£7264.18). Meanwhile, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin have all seen increases this week in what appears to be a trend for virtual currencies.

Litecoin is sitting at $217.15 (£153.89) after an increase of 47.04 per cent in the last seven days. Finally, Bitcoin Cash has seen an increase of $168.59 (£119.48) this week that has taken its value up to $1464.54 (£1037.92).

US daytime television chat show queen, Ellen DeGeneres, featured bitcoin in a recent segment, wondering aloud about its fundamental mysteries with her enthused audience. And while it was a funny look at the cryptocurrency, she managed to expose an often missed demographic to cryptocurrency: baby goat loving moms.

Ellen DeGeneres Pokes Fun at Bitcoin

“One thing I am down with right now, that I think everybody is learning about, is bitcoin. Who’s heard of bitcoin? Who can explain what bitcoin is? Liar. Nobody knows how it works. Nobody,” host Ellen DeGeneres, 60, said incredulously during her eponymously named program.

The Ellen DeGeneres Show is enjoying its 15th year as a daily entertainment talk show. And with over 2,500 episodes under its belt, the Warner Brothers Television distributed program has racked up 59 Daytime Emmy Awards, eclipsing the mighty Oprah. Ellen kicks so much ass, Telepictures signed the show through 2020, even launching a game show component.

“Everybody is talking about bitcoin; nobody understands it,” Ms. DeGeneres continued. “It’s like a plot twist in a confusing movie. When you’re watching a movie and your friends act like they know what’s going on, and you’re like, ‘Yeah, I do too!’ And then you’re like, ‘What the hell is every … I have no idea!’ All I know is that bitcoin is either worth twenty thousand dollars or nothing; that’s what I know. It’s like a digital Antiques Roadshow. You’re just standing in line, and you have no idea until you get there.”

Though she now commands a daily audience nearing 3 million, Ms. DeGeneres has earned her spot among comedy greats. She began in the 1980s as that rather rare bird, a female stand up comedian. In 1990s she had the chance in two situation comedies, neither of which went as well as her present gig, but she forged new ground by publicly announcing her sexual orientation. In 2008 she married girlfriend Portia de Rossi. She is now considered a leading advocate for sexual minorities. She is also famous for her voice work in the Pixar franchises Finding Nemo and Finding Dory, and for having hosted the Emmys, Grammy Awards, and the Academy Awards. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama.

Economics Ellen

The self-effacing comedian explained, “But they didn’t call me ‘Economics Ellen’ in high school for nothing. They called me that because I failed economics. So I did a little research, and I am going, to the best of my ability, explain how bitcoin works. Okay, first, the article I read said bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. Now, to be honest, I don’t know what that means. But here’s what I am going to do. I am going to explain it and I think we’re all going to get this. Pretend like bitcoin is a goat. Now, it’s adorable, right? Everyone agrees it’s adorable. And you want to pick it up and you want to pet it, right? But you can’t because it’s not there. It doesn’t exist for except on that internet right there … just like bitcoin is digital currency,” and a visual of a baby goat appeared on a large screen behind her.

“You’re probably thinking: ‘Ellen, if I cannot physically touch it, where do I keep my bitcoin? In a digital purse? Which is a funny idea, but it’s kinda true. You keep it in a digital wallet, okay,” Ms. DeGeneres said, showing pictures of the popular Toast wallet. “And the digital wallet can either be apps on your phone or tiny hard drives like this,” she elaborated, and what appears to be a cold storage product from Ledger flashes on the same screen. “Which is a really good idea because who wouldn’t feel safe with their life savings on a piece of plastic that could go into the washing machine. And it sounds like a Jimmy Kimmel prank, but it’s not. A digital wallet holds all of your bitcoin, unlike your real wallet which holds receipts and punch cards for free Jamba Juice.”

Teasing is certainly welcome in the bitcoin space, especially after the last few months. Though its price is bouncing back, many bitcoiners were starting wonder what would become of the asset. It would be hard to beat 2017’s success. However, if popular acceptance and acknowledgement from the likes of 50 Cent, Jay-Z, and now Ellen are any indication, the ecosystem might be in for another crazy ride.

Ms. DeGeneres ended the segment by suggesting, “I also found out bitcoin operates sorta like the stock market, so say you own one bitcoin and when you bought it it was worth ten thousand dollars, okay? And then for some reason bitcoin becomes worth twenty thousand dollars; you just doubled your money. Personally I’d rather own a baby goat. But that’s just me. Basically if you invest in bitcoin you’ll either be a millionaire or totally broke.”

Is this the year bitcoin moves fully into the mainstream? Let us know in the comments section below.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- A 24-year-old trader who considered himself ""invincible"" according to federal investigators has become the first target of a criminal fraud prosecution involving ""cryptocurrency,"" after allegedly siphoning $2 million in Bitcoin and Litecoin from his Chicago employer.Joseph Kim, whose bio lists him as a 2016 graduate of University of Chicago, is charged with fraud against Consolidated Trading LLC.Kim made his initial court appearance in Chicago Federal Court Friday in front of U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel G. Martin at the Dirksen Federal Building. He is charged with one count of wire fraud. He did not enter a plea. Judge Martin asked the Korean-American defendant if he spoke English and understood the proceedings, which he did.As part of his $100,000 bond deal, Kim surrendered his passport and his travel is now limited between northern Illinois and Arizona. The bond conditions also include a restriction that Kim cannot engage in any trading of securities , commodities or cryptocurrency on behalf of third parties. Any funds traded must belong solely to Kim.He is also restricted from communicating with his former co-workers at Consolidated Trading.The federal complaint claims Kim illegally transferred the firm's cryptocurrency to his own personal accounts to cover trading losses.Kim then lied about the transfers and tried to cover up the illegal trades by repaying some of the funds, prosecutors claim.Kim referred to himself as ""DEGEN"" according to a federal complaint, short for ""degenerative gambler.""In an email to his bosses last November, Kim allegedly admitted to the scheme. ""It was not my intention to steal for myself"" he is quoted as writing. ""Until the end I was perversely trying to fix what I had already done""He added according to prosecutors.

But there's a catch: it requires time and a lot of computing power. If you could somehow spread those computing demands out among hundreds — and sometimes even thousands or millions — of unknowing users, it would greatly reduce the cost and time of mining expensive coins.

As nefarious as that sounds, it's exactly what several websites were discovered to be doing by IT security company ESET in September last year.

Previously, criminals would go about hijacking someone else's computer to mine coins through a malicious program that was installed. But a more lightweight and less noticeable (at least from the user's perspective) way of doing it is by running a JavaScript file right from within the browser — no exploits or vulnerabilities needed. Instead of infecting the users' computers, websites are being infected with malicious ads. All that needs to happen for mining to begin is that a user needs to visit an infected website with JavaScript enabled.

Now playing: Watch this: What the heck is blockchain?

What's the big deal with mining anyway?

Inherently, mining cryptocurrencies is not a bad thing. It's how transactions are processed. You can learn more about it in our cryptocurrency and blockchain explainer but, in short, when a cryptocurrency transaction is announced to a blockchain network, computers on that network begin solving complex mathematical puzzles to confirm the currency has not already been used. In exchange for the work, miners (people whose computers were used to process the transaction) are rewarded a small amount of cryptocurrency.

No big deal, right?

With some cryptocurrencies -- such as Monero -- mining is relatively fast and simple and doesn't need a specialized computer to process the transactions. On the other hand, Bitcoin is notoriously slow and complex to mine and requires tons of processing power to lift the heavy load.

If someone were to tax your home computer with this, the CPU usage would skyrocket, simple tasks would become painstakingly slow and the fans on your computer would kick into overdrive. And if you were using a laptop, the battery life would take a significant and noticeable hit.

Fortunately, when a website is tapping into your computer to mine cryptocurrency, it's not likely mining Bitcoin. Instead, it's likely mining a currency like Monero or Dash. And in order to lower the chances of being detected by both the user and ad blockers, it typically limits its impact on the CPU to under 50 percent.

None of that is to say it should be done without your knowledge. In many cases today, web developers and criminals are hijacking people's computers for profit. That's not OK.

Not all user-driven mining is bad either

Enlarge Image Taylor Martin/CNET

Using the computing power of users to mine coin isn't always a plot to some diabolical plan, however. Coinhive, for example, is a readily available script that web developers can deploy to mine the cryptocurrency Monero. In some instances, such as on Salon.com, visitors can choose to suppress advertisements on the website if they agree to allow the company to use their unused central processing unit (or CPU, the brains of the computer and the component responsible for interpreting and executing commands) power to mine coins while they browse the site.

Not all websites are as transparent as Salon, however. Some websites can quietly use your CPU to mine cryptocurrency and you wouldn't know unless you went out of your way to find out.

How to know when a website is mining cryptocurrency

So with all of this happening in the background, how could you possibly know when your computer is being used for mining? The easiest way is to keep an eye on your CPU usage.

In Windows , right-click the taskbar and select Task Manager . Open the Performance tab.



, right-click the taskbar and select . Open the tab. In MacOS, open Activity Monitor by searching for it with Spotlight (pressing Command + Spacebar) or by going to Applications > Utilities > Activity Monitor. Once open, click the CPU tab. Total CPU usage in MacOS is the sum of system and user usages.

While it varies from computer to computer, a normal percentage for casual usage (browsing the web, taking notes, etc.) is generally 20 percent or less. If you see unexpected spikes in usage when you open an otherwise simple webpage, it's not an absolute given that mining is going on. But it should give you cause for concern and is a possible red flag and a sign that JavaScript is being used for more than you bargained for. Closing the tab should cause the CPU usage to drop.

If your CPU usage doesn't drop, it could also be the case that your computer has been infected with malicious software that is mining your computer in the background or you could have fallen victim to a ""pop-under"" window. Anti-malware software Malwarebytes warned of this back in November. Instead of running within the browser tab you already have open, a new window with the JavaScript is opened, but it's sized to fit and hide behind the clock in the Windows taskbar.

With a pop-under, closing the browser will not stop the mining, since a hidden tab will still be open. Instead, you will have to use Task Manager to completely quit the browser. If you notice a significant drop in CPU usage then, it's likely your computer was affected by a sneaky mining script.

How to stop sites from using your CPU to mine

As mentioned above, not all mining is bad, especially if a website is upfront about it. In fact, you may want to support a website with mining instead of viewing ads — it's a pretty fair trade-off.

But if you want better control over which sites can use your CPU to mine coins, make sure to read our guide.",,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sterling-consolidated-announces-it-will-accept-bitcoin-and-other-cryptocurrencies-for-its-stock-300600092.html,"Additionally, as disclosed in the Company's Form 1-A filing made on Wednesday, the Company has announced plans to accept Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash as consideration for the Shares publicly offered.

U.S. states with positive attitudes have advanced towards bitcoin legalization – a process that a growing number of elected officials consider inevitable, if not desirable. Numerous crypto-friendly bills have been introduced, and some of them have received approval in committees and houses of state legislatures. One wouldn’t necessarily think of states like Arizona, Tennessee, and Wyoming as the backbone of a great nation’s economy. How about… pioneers of its future development?

Bitcoin Doesn’t Stink – Arizona Will Take It

For some time now legislators in the Grand Canyon State have been thinking how to facilitate residents receiving incomes and profits in cryptocurrency. If bitcoin is good for ordinary citizens and businesses, it should be good enough for the state coffers, local lawmakers have decided. Last week Arizona got closer to accepting cryptos as legal tender for taxation purposes.

Several bills recognizing coins as currencies have been making their way in the State Legislature, as news.bitcoin.com reported. Two of them, SB1091 and SB1145, were aimed at regulating tax payments with digital currency. The SB1091 draft, sponsored by four Republican lawmakers, was endorsed by the Senate on February 8, with a 16 – 13 vote, after passing the Finance Committee in January. If the bill is adopted by the House, Arizona will become the first U.S. state to accept taxes in cryptocurrency in just a couple of years. The new law states:

A taxpayer may pay their income tax liability using a payment gateway, such as bitcoin, litecoin or any other recognized cryptocurrency, using electronic peer-to-peer systems.

It then clarifies that the Department of Revenue “shall convert cryptocurrency payments to United States Dollars at the prevailing rate after receipt and shall credit the taxpayer’s account with the converted dollar amount actually received, less any fees or costs incurred for conversion”. A similar bill was voted down in New Hampshire two years ago with concerns that the state would have to bear responsibility for converting the cryptos on volatile markets. Its sponsor, NH State Representative Eric Schleien (R), explained that there would be no cost and no risk to the state, as conversion would be automatic.

Another draft law, HB2601, is expected to regulate crowdfunding through initial coin offerings in Arizona. Its first reading in the House of Representatives is scheduled for June 2, 2018, and the second reading should take place on July 2. It is sponsored by Representative Jeff Weninger (R) who is also among the authors of the tax amendments. Recently, he told Fox that state legislators want to “send a signal to everyone in the United States that Arizona is going to be the place to be for digital currency technology”.

Others Have Taken the Same Road

Tennessee is another state that may soon legalize cryptocurrencies and crypto payments. A proposal to do that has come with a bill that would officially recognize cryptocurrency financial transactions and smart contracts in the state. It would also protect ownership rights of information secured on blockchain networks.

We are not just competing with other states in this space, we are competing with the whole world.

That’s what Tennessee House Representative Jason Powell (D) said after a presentation on blockchain technology last month. The Nashville lawmaker also called for adopting a “meaningful legislation” in the Volunteer State, as reported by The Tennessean. “It is really important to say that Tennessee is supportive of this technology and we want to be a leader in this innovation”, Powell added. Local authorities have already indicated that money transmitter licenses will not be required to trade cryptocurrencies in the state.

Wyoming may also become a crypto-friendly jurisdiction and is already taking steps to improve its attractiveness for startups from the sector. Several drafts have been introduced in the state legislature. Respective committees have passed two of them and they are now ready for the House of Representatives.

According to bill 0070, “a person who develops, sells or facilitates the exchange of an open blockchain token is not subject to specified securities laws”, if the token can be exchanged for goods and services. The legislation exempts exchanges from regulations applicable to brokers and dealers. Exemptions for cryptocurrency traders and transactions are also included in a draft to amend the Money Transmitter Act (0019).

Kansas and New Hampshire are two other states that have passed legislation with crypto-related exempts in their money transmitter regulations. In Texas companies are not licensed when offering custodial exchange services to in-state customers, and Montana has no applicable money transmission laws. Authorities in Nevada have promised to create favorable conditions for startups working with blockchain technologies. Most other states have yet to adopt their regulatory frameworks.

In the weeks following its public launch, Cardano’s ADA coin has quickly risen to become the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market cap.

Finance Magnates spoke with Charles Hoskinson about Cardano’s technology, the future of Cardano, and some of the controversy surrounding the coin.

This article is the second in a series of two. To read the first, click here. To hear the full interview, click the Soundcloud and Youtube links.





Cardano has risen pretty quickly in terms of market capitalization, hovering around fifth or sixth place for several weeks now. Why is Cardano worthy of this position?

Hoskinson answered this question with another question: “Why is anybody worthy of their positions in the market cap? Bitcoin is advertised as a payment system and a means of exchange, and then everybody who’s ever tried to use it for that, it’s been a miserable failure. They usually stop taking it, or they find ways to take cash, and through a creative structure like what Bitpay has done. Ethereum claims to be a world computer, but then CryptoKitties breaks it.”

He continued by acknowledging that “the reality is that everybody, all of our competitors are living in speculative land. They’re saying that at some point in the future, there is a belief that these systems will change the world. These systems will, within their own domain, really innovate and really change things.”

He continued by saying that Cardano’s position has been earned by popular opinion. “People are taking their bets. People are looking at the science, people are looking at the team, they’ve looked at the progress made already, they looked at the philosophy, how we go about doing our business, and they made a bet that Cardano seems to be a contender.”

To be frank, within 6 months or a year, we will be pound-for-pound better than Ethereum and Bitcoin in every dimension and aspect, just based on how our roadmap is rolling out. That’s just generation one. We’re still moving our way forward to be able to shard, and scale, and we have a great strategy for that. I think a lot of people that have entered our ecosystem are betting that Cardano is going to be the strong contender.

Hoskinson conceded that Cardano isn’t the only strong player in the market. “Ripple could certainly be a strong contender. They have a very strong philosophy of when and how these things ought to structured. The same for Ethereum, the same for Bitcoin. That’s why most people diversify and they bet on five, or ten, or fifteen.”

He continued: “I think a lot of people are making a strategic bet. Now if i’m wrong, you can vote by your feet and leave. If I’m right, well, welcome aboard. Regardless, I’m building this over a long term. I want ADA and Cardano to be used 50 years from now, I want this to be like TCP IP. Our vision is for Cardano to be the financial stack of the developing world.

“We want this to be used throughout Africa, and the Caribbean, and South America, and to run in parallel with the financial system of the developing world, and eventually consume it, and transform it from the outside, as opposed to what Ripple is trying to do which is transform it from the inside. I don’t wanna go down that road.”

I’d like to know more about the security features that ADA is bringing to the table. You’ve heard of the recent hack on Coincheck –in response, NEM introduced a tracking feature to its blockchain to render the stolen coins useless. Is there anything similar being planned by ADA?

Hoskinson began his response to this question with concerns about the philosophical implications of modifying a ledger to make coins traceable: “I think the entire purpose of cryptocurrency is that when you give a centralized actor the ability to breach fungibility, and label tokens bad vs. good. So, what happens when you’re a political opponent of the government and they decide to turn off your money by blacklisting you? I have very strong philosophical disagreements when you introduce centralization for consumer protection purposes on an open protocol.

He continued to say that while subsets of a ledger may act in a traceable or more centralized fashion, he takes issue with the modification of a protocol. “When it’s built into the protocol itself, I think that that’s an incredible moral hazard, it’s a huge danger. The whole point of cryptocurrencies to avoid capital controls and civil asset forfeiture, and these types of fungibility attacks, which damage liberty and personal property. We already have a system that works.”

Hoskinson explained that in order to make sure that a blockchain’s protocol is secure, “you need high assurance that the Crypto is right, and that the protocols are correctly designed. What we do there is we take our protocols through peer review. For example, Ouroboros is the proof of stake algorithm that guides our system. The follow-up paper we took to Eurocrypt. “

He added that educating the user to use crypto correctly is also incredibly important to We do it in stages and layers, and they’re called refinement iterations. The final stage of it is, okay you have the protocol, you have the software, then you have the user. You have to train your user.

“You need to educate people. It takes quite a bit of time and effort to do that. You do that through meetup groups, regular publications about things, podcasts, and training series. That’s why we have a whole education division at IOHK… to teach people how to properly use Daedalus, how to properly use cold storage, how to use paper wallets, how to use how to avoid being scammed, these types of things.”

He concluded: “The only way you can really have a high assurance there is using formal specification and verification. Then there’s user education, and when you do these three things you end up having a very secure ecosystem. Now, there is a question of what will we support to be able to enhance security in the ecosystem. So multisig hardware wallets, and paper wallets, are absolutely required for people to safely secure their funds.”

ADA has been listed on Bittrex. Are there any plans underway to list it on any more exchanges? I know that it’s listed on a few others, but Bittrex is by far the most notable.

In response to this question, Charles said: “The challenge for us was that when you build something 100% new code (Cardano is a completely new way of going about things) it’s great because you have unlimited dimensions of freedom to do whatever the heck you want to do. The downside of that is that you’re gonna have to spend a little more time in QA, and learning the ropes, and getting your APIs right, and so forth.”

Charles explained that the choice not to list on a lot of exchanges at the beginning of ADA’s journey was a deliberate decision. “There are kind of two dimensions. One was user experience from using a wallet, and the other is exchange experience when they list in high-performance demands. They really stress their wallets, because they’re dealing with hundreds of thousands of concurrent accounts–lots of ins and outs, and so forth.

He continued, “So we said, “hey, we would be bloody mad if we tried to list on ten or fifteen exchanges right at the beginning, because what’s gonna happen is if we’ve made any mistakes, or if the wallet is not optimized, then all of those wallets are gonna break on the exchanges. Then we’re gonna spend 95 percent of our engineering time fixing that, and never making any progress on Shelley or any future releases until we get over some technical humps.”

IOHK partnered up with the University of Edinburgh to launch Scotland’s first blockchain technology laboratory. The lab brings together academics and students to collaborate on blockchain research and development. Watch this video to learn more: https://t.co/yrLegockin — Cardano Community (@cardanocom) February 12, 2018

Charles added that education and dialogue with exchanges and users was another important reason to take time to roll out Cardano onto myriad crypto exchanges. “What we can do is have a dialogue with the [exchanges], and learn a little bit about what’s the best way to deploy on exchanges, and have an enterprise API specifically for exchanges. Once that’s done, we can roll it all out and it’s much easier to list on ten, twenty exchanges, and they can list it by themselves. Then they won’t really need a lot of support from us, because they have the stuff already there.”

He explained that there are some changes coming up on the immediate horizon. “In about the next two weeks we should have all of those upgrades done for exchanges, as well as an exchange listing manual. Then there’s gonna be another wave that comes onboard, maybe five or six of them. There’s been a lot of negotiations. So more exchanges are coming, and certainly there.”

According to Charles, Cardano has brought a lot of new users into the crypto space–users that need to be educated about how to use exchanges correctly. “About half of the people who bought ADA, had never bought a Cryptocurrency before. They’re completely new, they’re like Bitcoiners. So as a consequence, these people kind of needed some training wheels.”",2018-02-16 08:59:19+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-dazzling-history-of-bitcoins-ups-and-downs,"This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

One of the most popular memes on the cryptocurrency subreddit r/bitcoin, arguably the largest concentration of Bitcoin enthusiasts on the internet, depicts a cartoon coin riding a roller coaster with its hands waving wildly in the air. On days when Bitcoin is skyrocketing in price, the meme shows the rollercoaster launching straight upward, and on days when Bitcoin is crashing, the funny facsimile is seen enduring a near-vertical drop. This dual-sided internet joke has accompanied nearly every significant movement in Bitcoin’s price in recent years and is telling in its frequency.

Bitcoin is perpetually rising and falling in relative fiat value, and even early 2018’s 70% decline isn’t surprising, nor is it the worst ever witnessed. Even amidst the most sickening of freefalls, experienced traders remain unfazed, because they’ve been there before. Holding through a correction is almost a rite of passage for cryptocurrency investors, and the group’s most experienced veterans have endured more than their fair share over the years.

June 2011

The early days of Bitcoin were its ‘Wild West’— a time when very few exchanges made trading possible, and when only the bravest of the brave dipped their toes in. Such conditions were all but starved of liquidity, and so when the price began rising from around $0.95, the incline and the following drop were some of the steepest ever recorded.

In mid-June 2011, Bitcoin’s price reached as high as $32.00 per coin before tumbling all the way to $2.00 in November. At a 94% decline, this crash still maintains its record and holds painful memories for early investors, though those who held strong are now counting their lucky stars (and wads of bills). Looking back, this double-digit all-time high seems low, but one must remember that there was a fraction of today’s volume and interest. Bitcoin was still a largely unknown thought experiment, and no one had any indication of its future. Accordingly, $32 seemed like a good time to take profit, especially after such a spike, and other traders began to capitulate.

January 2012

The second significant crash happened just months after Bitcoin bottomed out at $2.00 per coin. Though the price had more than doubled from lows by the end of 2011, the market was still fearful, as it had watched the cryptocurrency fall from $32.00 only recently.

Starting the year at an optimistic $4.50, Bitcoin increased in January to over $7.00. However, dip buyers today should look to this time and take note, as it exemplifies an important fact: Bitcoin isn’t guaranteed to reach its previous all-time high before correcting once more. From around $7.40, it took a frightening 49% decline to just $3.80 in late January, shaking out some investors who had held through November’s debacle.

April 2013

The period between early 2012 and 2013 was uneventful. Bitcoin gained steadily and began 2013 at a price of around $13.00, reaching as high as $17.00 in 2012. Early 2013 was a bullish phase for the cryptocurrency, as it pushed past its all-time high of $32.00, reaching $49.00 before a one-day minor correction back to $33.00.

Many new exchanges and traders, in addition to expanded media coverage helped Bitcoin recover quickly, and it put on gains at a feverish pace until April, where bulls finally capitulated at a price of $260.00, breaking well into the triple digits. An outage at the then most popular exchange, Mt. Gox, was also credited as impetus for the decline. Profit-taking turned into a full-on freefall down to $40.00, for a total loss of 83%.

November 2013

Known as the biggest and most exemplary of Bitcoin crashes, it’s no surprise that the infamous 87% decline happened in November 2013. As the latest buildup to $20,000.00 indicated, Bitcoin bull runs tend to spin into a frenzy late in the year. As many predicted, November to January 2014 is a near mirror-image of the last four months, with a huge influx of new traders and media attention helping bitcoin reach unthinkable highs.

In late 2013, the price was nearing $1,200.00—a psychologically significant price that helped the subsequent decay last for years. With a total of 411 days in correction, helped in part by the epic implosion of Mt. Gox and erasure of almost $500 million, the post-November low was only reached in January 2015 at about $150.00.

November 2017

Five years on the dot after Bitcoin’s four-figure debut, the king cryptocurrency skyrocketed past the five-figure mark at $10,000.00 and pushed all the way to $20,000.00 before losing steam. The two years’ prior would prove to be some of the best opportunities to buy, and even those who purchased bitcoin at the year’s opening price of $750.00 gained significantly.

In December, a small correction down to $14,000.00 wasn’t enough to stop momentum, which quickly took it back to $17,000.00 before breaking down. Concerns about Bitcoin’s sustainability, especially with a plethora of impressive alternative solutions being released, only made the selloff more extreme. Support emerged near $5,900.00—the mid-to-late 2017 level when the cryptocurrency pricing began exhibiting a near exponential rise. A total decline of over 70% could go lower, if 2013 is anything to go by, but markets are optimistic for 2018.

Looking Ahead

If anything, this long history of repeated boom and bust is an optimistic signal. Once Bitcoin entered the headlines, it never left, and it continues to snowball in popularity with retail investors and media attention the longer it stays relevant. Throughout regulatory pressures, technical difficulties, and many more corrections than the ones highlighted above, the cryptocurrency has remained at the forefront of the Blockchain revolution.

Bitcoin’s fate is tied to more than its believers, however, and the multi-year struggle that occurred post-2013 demonstrates that the path back upwards isn’t always straight. With its whales creating waves whenever they like, miners searching for other ways to profit, and a new futures market, Bitcoin’s outlook remains anything but transparent.",

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has suspended trading in the stocks of three companies with ties to cryptocurrency. One of the three is also planning an initial coin offering. The SEC says it is concerned about the nature of the companies’ business operations and the value of their assets.

SEC Suspends Trading of Three Stocks

The SEC has “suspended trading in three companies amid questions surrounding similar statements they made about the acquisition of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology-related assets,” the agency announced on Thursday. They are Cherubim Interests, PDX Partners, and Victura Construction Group. The three stocks are traded over-the-counter, with a market capitalization of less than $5 million each, according to Factset. The suspension is temporary, beginning on February 16 and ending on March 2.

The agency stated that the three companies issued press releases claiming that they have “acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things.” However, the SEC says there are questions regarding the nature of the companies’ business operations and the value of their assets.

In addition, Cherubim Interests also announced that it will launch an initial coin offering (ICO). The trading suspension of this company’s shares is also due to its delinquency in filing annual and quarterly reports with the Commission.

Acquisitions and ICO

The three companies’ press releases list the same chief executive officer, Patrick J. Johnson, “who played for the Oregon Ducks and the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL,” wrote the Oregonian.

Johnson told the publication that PDX Partners makes iPhone apps, adding that last month the company “acquired $350 million in assets belonging to a private equity firm called NVC Fund Holding Trust, whose portfolio includes ‘cryptocurrency and business financial services’.”

Cherubim Interests and Victura Construction Group have also made similar acquisitions. Furthermore, the former announced on January 3 that it has “executed a financing commitment of $100,000,000 to launch [an] initial coin offering for The Self Sustaining Intentional Communities Coin (Symbol SJT),” adding that “The sale of the coins will generate the capital to create self-sustaining intentional communities across the US and across 57 nations.”

Regulators’ Warnings

In August of last year, the SEC issued an Investor Alert about public companies making ICO-related claims. “The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy is warning investors about potential scams involving stock of companies claiming to be related to, or asserting they are engaging in, Initial Coin Offerings (or ICOs),” the agency wrote, adding that “Fraudsters often try to use the lure of new and emerging technologies to convince potential victims to invest their money in scams.”

The SEC’s action against the three companies come at the same time another US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), issued a warning about dump-and-pump schemes involving “thinly traded or new ‘alternative’ virtual currencies, digital coins or tokens.”

The ways in which cryptocurrency enthusiasts can spend their virtual riches is growing, if only for those who are millionaires — at least on paper.

As bitcoin and other digital currencies gain a broader following, luxury service providers are starting to take notice. The latest is Florida-based yacht dealer Denison Yachting, which on Friday announced that new, high-end yachts can be purchased with bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies at the Miami Yacht Show, which kicked off this week.

""It is our job as the dealer or broker to make purchases as easy as possible. So for us this is just another effort to come to where the client is,"" said Bob Denison, president and founder of Denison Yachting. ""Sometimes my friends on the dock act like this is a marketing gimmick, but we've actually gotten results from it and I truly believe in it.""

Potential buyers can make purchases with their digital wealth, including bitcoin cash, ethereum and Tron, a lesser known cryptocurrency developed by former Ripple advisor and entrepreneur Justin Sun.

Cryptocurrencies, of course, have been on a wild ride of volatility, with bitcoin off sharply from a record high near $20,000. Does that make people like Denison unwise to accept it as payment? He certainly doesn't think so.

""Inherently there would be a little bit of a risk, but I truly believe in the future of cryptocurrency and I truly believe it will stabilize. The more [transactions like this] happen the less crazy it will sound,"" he said.

Last year, Dr. Wei Tzuoh Chen put his 9,000-square-foot beachfront Malibu home on the market for $45 million, and explicitly stated he was willing to accept bitcoin as payment. A month later, the crytocurrency began a brutal selloff that briefly dragged it below $10,000.",2018-02-17,https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-regions-to-develop-large-scale-crypto-mining/,"Two Russian Regions to Develop Large Scale Crypto Mining

The governors of two Russian regions have indicated their readiness to accommodate large crypto mining facilities. Two of the westernmost subjects of the Federation – Kaliningrad and Leningrad – are willing to welcome miners and want to get involved in “bitcoin production”. Local authorities have expressed intentions to take mining out of garages and scale it up to industrial level. They are now pressing Moscow for regulations.

One Huge Mining Farm

Many are interested in cryptocurrencies in Kaliningrad Oblast, its governor Anton Alihanov said on the sidelines of the Russian Investment Forum in Sochi. In the future, the region may become one huge mining farm, he told RIA Novosti.

“We have a lot of people that show interest [in crypto mining]. But doing everything right is pretty complicated and you don’t want to set the house on fire,” Alihanov said. “That’s why we have a ‘mining hotel’, where guys know how to set up the cooling systems, so that nothing gets burned”, the official added, demonstrating technical knowledge of the subject.

If you are a miner, you’ve come to the right place. We can become one huge mining farm.

Alihanov also noted that Kaliningrad Oblast has developed a booming greenhouse sector producing tons of strawberries. Greenhouses need heating during colder months and mining hardware produces a lot of heat. Mining farms can actually be built close to the strawberry fields to heat the greenhouses.

Still wary of buying cryptocurrencies, the governor admitted he had some “rich experience” with stock trading in the past. “Stocks, bonds, futures – these are very risky things. I don’t have funds that I am ready to part with at any moment. For now I keep my distance,” Anton Alihanov said. He added, however, that when crypto markets become more stable, he may have a second thought.

Miners to Use a Decommissioned NPP

Other local officials have also announced intentions to conduct mining business in their regions. Authorities in Leningrad Oblast, bordering the federal city of Saint Petersburg, plan to create a tech park for cryptocurrency miners. It will be built on the premises of the nuclear power plant in Sosnovy Bor, governor Alexandr Drozdenko revealed. The Leningrad Atomic Electro-Station (LAES, or LNPP) will be decommissioned in 2020-2021.

A new power plant will replace the RBMK units at LAES, which now produces about 50% of the region’s electricity. LAES-2 will be equipped with the safer, “post-Fukushima” WWER-1200 reactors. LAES is the largest electricity generating facility in Russia’s northwest.

The economic department of the Leningrad administration and Rosatom have already approved the project to mine cryptos at LAES, Drozdenko told RIA Novosti. “What we need for mining is cheap electrical energy, cooling system and reliable transmission grid. We have all that at the Leningrad NPP,” he said.

Russians are mining in their garages. We want to do it on an industrial scale.

According to the governor, two outstanding issues postpone the realization of the project. “First – we have to wait until the old equipment is removed [after the decommissioning]. Secondly, we need some regulatory framework that would allow us to mine, to produce bitcoin,” Alexandr Drozdenko explained. He added that “serious negotiations” on regulation are underway between his administration and the federal government.

With cheap energy, developed electrical infrastructure and cool climate, Russia has what it takes to accommodate local cryptocurrency miners and welcome foreign investors. Authorities in regions with great potential to develop the sector are impatient and expect new regulations from Moscow as soon as possible.

Despite recent corrections in crypto markets, you might have some big gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But taxes are an ever-present danger, and it is clear that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is looking for reporting. With all the worry about so-called 1031 tax-free exchanges that can no longer be used for cryptocurrency, are there any other ways to transfer your crypto without triggering taxes? Here are some ideas, each way has pluses and minuses.

Contributing to a corporation or partnership

How about contributing your cryptocurrency to a corporation or partnership that you will control? In general, transferring property into a corporation in exchange for its stock is a taxable event.

That is, the transaction is treated as if you sold the property to the corporation in return for cash. The difference between the stock value you received, and the tax basis in the property you transferred to the corporation, will result in a gain or loss. That means taxes. Of course, you generally don’t want this sale treatment.

Fortunately, Section 351 of the tax code generally allows people to transfer property to a corporation in exchange for stock without trigger tax, even if the property is appreciated. The corporation can be either an S corporation (basically taxed as a flow-through) or a C corporation (that itself pays taxes). The corporation can be newly organized or already existing.

Of course, some requirements must be met. But if you meet them, some gains on an exchange of property for stock can be delayed. The IRS can tax it later when the shareholder eventually sells the stock received in the exchange. No gain or loss is triggered as long as you receive only stock in exchange for your property and you are in control of the corporation immediately after the exchange.

The control means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the total number of outstanding shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. If you, along with others, transfer property into a corporation, you can do this as a group. So you don’t have to have control personally.

The same kind of thing can work for partnership or LLC. Contributions of property or money in exchange for partnership interest are usually non-recognition events. In a way that is similar to the rule for corporations, the contributions can be tax-free, both to the contributing partner and to the partnership.

For partnerships, this non-recognition rule is contained in Section 721(a) of the Tax Code. It generally applies regardless of whether the contribution is made on the formation of the partnership or after it has been in existence and operating for some time. But there are some potential traps, more so with partnerships than with corporations. For example, this non-recognition rule does not apply to transactions between the partnership and a partner acting outside his capacity as a partner, or when the purported contribution is a disguised sale.

Moreover, under Section 721(b), the no tax rule also does not apply to gain realized upon a contribution of property to a partnership “investment company,” where the contribution results in the diversification of the transferor’s assets. All of these issues that can trigger taxes can be hard to spot.

How about gifts?

You can give crypto as a gift, and it doesn’t trigger income taxes. That’s right, no income tax to you as the donor, and no income tax to the recipient. Of course, when the recipient transfers or sells it, there would be income taxes then.

And at that point, the donee would need to calculate gain or loss. What is his or her tax basis, since it was a gift? The tax basis is the same as it was in your hands when you made the gift.

Keep in mind that to avoid income taxes, a gift has to be really a gift. The tax law is littered with cases of people who claimed something was a gift, but who got stuck with income taxes. With gifts not being subject to income taxes, it can seem tempting to try to characterize money or property you receive as gifts. But be careful: the IRS hears this ‘it was a gift’ excuse a lot.

And the IRS is unlikely to be persuaded unless you can document it. Plus, the IRS will expect a gift to occur in a normal gift-like setting. For example, if an employer or former employer gives a loyal employee $10,000 is that a gift? No, it is a bonus, treated as wages. Even trying to document it as a gift may not change that result.

True gifts may not trigger any income taxes, but there could be gift taxes involved. If you give crypto to a friend or family member —to anyone really— ask how much it is worth. If the gift is worth more than $15,000, it requires you to file a gift tax return. For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called “annual exclusion.” You can give gifts up to this amount each year to any number of people with no reporting required.

Any gifts over that $15,000 amount require a gift tax return, even though you may not have to pay any gift tax. Rather than paying it, you normally would use up a small portion of your lifetime exclusion from gift and estate tax. For 2018, that number went up dramatically. The amount you can transfer tax-free during your life or on death just went up to $11.2 mln per person. That is $22.4 mln per married couple.

Donation to charity

What if your gift isn’t to a person, but to charity? If you give to charity, that can be very tax-smart. If you give crypto to a qualified charity, you should normally get an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the crypto. If you bought it for $500, and donate to a 501(c)(3) charity when it is worth $15,000, you should get a $15,000 charitable contribution deduction. What’s more, you won’t have to pay the capital gain or income tax on the $14,500 spread. That’s a good deal. It’s why most savvy people, think Warren Buffett, want to donate appreciated property rather than money to charity.

Remember, if you use crypto to buy something, the IRS considers that a sale of your crypto. You have to calculate gain or loss. You might have bought something with your crypto. But you made a sale in the process!

The cryptocurrency landscape has changed significantly over the past 12 months. Gone are the guaranteed returns of 5x, 10x or greater on ICOs, as a growing number of investors clamor for a piece of the pie. New coins, new forks, and new airdrops have created a competitive marketplace characterized by diminishing returns and reduced profits. The best traders are still able to claim the lion’s share of the rewards though, leaving the rest to fight it out for the scraps.

Also read: Telegram Followers – The New Metric for Cryptocurrency Success

Welcome to 2018, Where 20% Is the New 20x

Up until last year, the best performing ICOs could be expected to net investors an easy 10x profit by flipping tokens the moment they were listed on an exchange. 2017’s best performers include Spectrecoin, which has provided a 2,143x return on its token price, Qtum (106x) and Neblio (103x). 2018’s best performer, Bluzelle, in comparison, has managed a mere 5x on its ICO price to date. That’s still a healthy profit admittedly, especially when compared to the sort of single digit gains to be enjoyed in traditional asset markets. But by cryptocurrency standards, 500% is small fry.

There are a number of reasons behind the reduced dividends. For one thing, the world has now caught on. Telegram groups promote the most promising ICOs, while projects that attract rapid community interest are prominently promoted, leaving fewer undiscovered gems. Everyone’s looking for the next Stratis, Dragonchain, or Antshares, and it’s not just crypto investors who are wise to this – so are the ICOs issuing the tokens. The best projects, or rather the ones that are generating the most hype, are able to raise their hard cap, increase the number of tokens issued, and bump up the token price in the knowledge that they’ll still sell out in hours. As notorious Twitter trader and shitposter Romano put it, “20% is the new 2x”.

Big Exchanges Are Triggering Smaller Pumps

20% seems an accurate figure for the sort of price bump that tokens added to major exchanges such as Binance and Kucoin can now expect. Bittrex, which has stagnated for months, has finally begun clearing out some of the deadwood, delisting tokens with low trading volume and replacing them with newer entrants. Its latest addition, Vatoms (VEE), was introduced on Friday, whereupon its price pumped by a modest 20%. Six months ago, the same feat would have seen a token previously only available on decentralized exchanges comfortably double in price.

Sites like Etherdelta and IDEX used to be frequented by more experienced traders on account of the complexities of using them, though the masses are catching on. Etherdelta’s interface is notoriously counterintuitive to use, even after successfully completing numerous transactions, while IDEX is at least a little more user-friendly. It’s not rocket science, but neither is it as seamless as setting a buy order on Binance. In January’s altcoin market, everyone was a winner, with everything from scamcoins to shitcoins pumping, causing newbs to conclude that they’d mastered the art of trading. As the mania dispersed and more bearish conditions set in, many of these newfound “pros” were forced to conclude that hodling was perhaps a safer strategy, leaving the riskier trades to those with the crypto wealth and TA skills to make it work.

100x Leverage Is Not for the Fainthearted

One exchange where it’s still business as usual for the top dogs is Bitmex. Thanks to its margin trading of up to 100x, skilled traders can profit handsomely off even the slightest moves in bitcoin’s price. It’s a high risk strategy that’s not for the fainthearted or the charting illiterate. The best of the best are still doing as well as ever though, with AngeloBTC the Twitter trader currently top of the heap.

The changed cryptocurrency landscape hasn’t entirely disadvantaged new traders and investors of low means. Thanks to the craze for airdrops, in which free tokens are awarded to community members for tasks such as following an ICO’s social channels, it’s possible to net up to $500 a month in freebies. It’s not a lot to play with, but with patience and perseverance these meager crumbs can be turned into a respectable pile, aided by a few shrewd trades along the way. The easy money in cryptocurrency may be no more, but there are still plenty of ways for enterprising investors to turn a little into a lump sum.

Bitcoin fue la primera. Desde su lanzamiento en 2009, se ha convertido en la criptomoneda más famosa, intercambiada y valiosa. Pero no es la única que juega en la ciudad.

Litecoin la siguió en 2011. Creada por Charles Lee, un ingeniero que después ayudó a construir Coinbase ––el mercado de criptomonedas más grande–– Litecoin está basada en el mismo código que bitcoin pero con algunos ajustes diseñados para abordar dos de las limitaciones de su predecesor: velocidad de transacción y acceso al proceso de minería.

Y en 2015, Ethereum hizo su debut incorporando la premisa básica de blockchain de Bitcoin, pero la velocidad de transacción más rápida que tiene Litecoin y, agregando algunas de sus propias sorpresas ––incluyendo la capacidad de procesar pequeños pedazos de código, llamados 'contratos inteligentes'––, además de que llegó con su propia red virtual persona-a-persona, a diferencia de los servidores dedicados o una plataforma de minería.

Ripple

El soporte de Coinbase para bitcoin, litecoin y ethereum ––así como el de Bitcoin Cash, una nueva rama de la blockchain de Bitcoin creada en agosto de 2017–– ayudó a que estas criptomonedas se mantuvieran como las más visibles y mejor capitalizadas. Para completar la dinámica lista de las 10 criptomonedas de mayor capitalización en el mercado, se encuentran algunas bien establecidas y otras nuevas que recién llegaron como ripple, cardano, neo, stellar, eos e IOTA.

Con el objetivo de presentarte algunos de los principales conceptos que prevalecen detrás de la creciente población de criptomonedas, daremos un vistazo más cercano a las tecnologías detrás de litecoin y ethereum, cómo se comparan con bitcoin y qué aporta cada una a la mesa para posibles inversionistas, mineros de datos y operadores.

Litecoin 101

Litecoin está estrechamente basada en bitcoin ––están creadas con el mismo código subyacente–– pero con algunos ajustes distintivos. La diferencia central es que litecoin se extrae utilizando el algoritmo Scrypt, que se basa en cálculos matemáticos que son más simples que los utilizados por el algoritmo SHA-256 de la bitcoin. Como resultado, en contraste con los equipos de minería especializados, costosos y de alta energía que se requieren para minar bitcoin, puedes extraer litecoin con una laptop o una PC decente, especialmente si está truqueada con una potente tarjeta gráfica.

Litecoin

Y como Scrypt es matemáticamente menos complejo que SHA-256, la extracción de litecoin es mucho más rápida que la minería de bitcoin. Un bloque de litecoin toma sólo 2.5 minutos para formarse, en comparación con los 10 minutos que toma se toma un bloque de bitcoin. Por lo tanto, las transacciones de litecoin también son más rápidas de procesar y confirmar.

Ethereum 101

Ethereum.org

Al igual que litecoin, se basa en el mismo concepto fundamental de blockchain como la bitcoin, con bloques y adiciones, pero ethereum agrega su propio toque distintivo. Fundada en 2014 a través de una oferta inicial de monedas, ethereum se ve a sí misma como ""una infraestructura global compartida enormemente poderosa"" que, además de servir como moneda digital, ejecuta aplicaciones especiales llamadas ""contratos inteligentes"".

Esta red informática colectiva y distribuida, llamada ""máquina virtual ethereum"", puede, en cierto sentido, alquilarse. Los participantes que consumen potencia informática pagan con tokens, llamados ether; aquellos que contribuyen con el poder de procesamiento pueden ganarlos. Por supuesto, los compradores y vendedores pueden simplemente intercambiar ether independientemente de estas actividades.

Considere que la minería de bitcoins es similar a la de miles de chefs que compiten febrilmente para preparar un plato nuevo y extremadamente complicado ––y sólo el primero en ofrece una versión perfecta de él recibe el pago. En la cocina de ethereum, los mineros sirven como el propietario del restaurante, compensado por proporcionar la infraestructura para que los chefs Ether puedan inventar nuevos tipos de cocina.

De hecho, un grupo de empresas y universidades ha formado una organización sin ánimo de lucro expresamente para legitimar ethereum; promoverlo como una plataforma de código abierto y no como una empresa comercial per se; y desarrollar y soportar aquellas aplicaciones que se ejecutan en él. Y estas no son startups pasajeras, estamos hablando de importantes jugadores de tecnología como Intel y Microsoft y gigantes financieros como JPMorgan y Credit Suisse.

¿Cuál criptomoneda es la más valiosa?

Bitcoin sigue siendo la criptomoneda más visible y comercializada con mayor frecuencia. Después de un notable despegue en noviembre de 2017, alcanzó apenas los US$20,000 a finales de diciembre de 2017, y luego de mantenerse en US$15,000 por algunas semanas, perdió otro 50 por ciento de su valor después de que los reguladores surcoreanos públicamente expresaron la prohibición de estas monedas. El precio de litecoin, a veces conocido como la 'plata' para el ""oro"" de bitcoin, siguió una tendencia de valuación similar a la de bitcoin y ahora ronda los US$160. Aunque las tres monedas han aumentado en valor durante los últimos 12 meses, ethereum ha trazado su propia ruta de comportamiento, aumentando su valor en junio de 2017 y superando los US$1,000 a principios de enero de 2018.

¿Cuál es mejor para ti?

Si solo fuera así de fácil. Nadie sabe si alguna criptomoneda aumentará su valor ––o incluso se mantendrá dentro de un año (aunque creemos que las que se describen en este artículo lograrán ambas cosas). Ninguna de ellas está regulada (todavía) y sólo las personas con la mayor capacidad de riesgo deben ingresar al mercado de criptomonedas. Dicho esto, hay diferencias significativas entre estas tres que podrían usarse para formar una base racional para invertir o explorar en una en lugar de otra.

Bitcoin es la opción de moda. Si estás buscando una criptomoneda que tenga la ventaja de hacerte ver como el primero en tenerla, una visibilidad popular inigualable y tener una capitalización de mercado más alta, es obvio. En el lado negativo, ahora es casi imposible lograr rentabilidad pero, después de haber aumentado más de 1,000 por ciento en el último año, podría haber gastado la mayor parte de su potencial de crecimiento. (Esto es discutible. Nadie sabe nada).

Litecoin ofrece sus propias ventajas. Su creador es una entidad conocida y activa en la comunidad de criptomonedas. Tiene una capacidad para transacciones más rápidas ––una ventaja potencial en sí misma, que también proporciona un conjunto de opciones de usos diferentes que bitcoin. Además, todavía ofrece el potencial de rentabilidad, a diferencia de bitcoin.

Ethereum tiene el respaldo de algunos grandes nombres ––lo que podría ser un beneficio o una desventaja, según tu opinión sobre el complejo sector financiero. Tiene el potencial del valor intrínseco como Litecoin o Bitcoin, pero también aplicaciones comerciales más obvias. Y, como Bitcoin, ha detonado cientos de otras monedas que se han creado utilizando su tecnología blockchain subyacente.

Independientemente de cuál te parezca más atractiva, haz tu propia investigación antes de invertir en cualquiera de estas criptomonedas.

Lo que debes saber de Bitcoin: ¿Cómo puede ser esta una forma legítima de recaudar dinero?",,https://techbullion.com/securrency-id-data-web-announce-blockbuster-crypto-partnership-deal/,"On Wednesday, February 7th, 2018, the FinTech/RegTech blockchain platform Securrency announced it would be entering a strategic partnership with ID DataWeb, a Washington D.C.-based company at the forefront of revolutionizing identity security services.

Who are they?

Securrency defines itself as “a combined FinTech/RegTech platform that enables the free trading of previously illiquid asset classes.” Their aim is to improve the security, transparency, efficiency, and accessibility of financial services through integration of “recent advances in distributed ledger technologies, payment gateways, and security frameworks.” With all the confusion that Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws entail, Securrency ensures that companies who seek to start Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are in line with those regulations on their behalf so that clients can focus more on the business aspects.

ID DataWeb is an integrated human identity security platform that continuously authenticates individuals’ identities though use of their Adaptive Authentication Solution, which consistently refreshes users’ identities and verifies any changes. Instead of requiring an investor to keep track of multiple login passwords and undergoing several sets of compliance documentation, ID DataWeb’s network allows for a singular login that grants access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), biometric verification, and government documents (their network spans over 70 identity services across more than 100 countries). In 2012, they were awarded a grant from the “National Institute of Standards and Technology to implement pilots for the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace.”

What this partnership means

The partnership will enable Securrency to provide faster, more secure investor verification, along with helping companies remain compliant with KYC and AML regulations. CEO of Securrecy, Dan Doney, says, “While the regulatory landscape remains uncertain, it is clear that there is a need for blockchain financial platforms that offer built-in accreditation and compliance services.” He believes that “by integrating ID DataWeb’s patented identity verification services into the core of the Securrency platform, companies conducting an ICO or offering tokenized investments can leverage a fully automated registration and compliance process that is in line with current securities regulation.”

Why this partnership is necessary

Not every company or investor fully understands the regulations that ICOs require, and China went so far as to ban the entire concept of cryptocurrency exchanges. On February 6th, 2018, lawmakers and regulators voiced their concerns regarding this matter at a U.S. Senate hearing. Jay Clayton, chairman of the the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted, “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts asked if any ICO has been subject to SEC registration, to which Clayton responded “Not one.” He further added, “I want to go back to separating ICOs and cryptocurrencies. ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story.”

With how ICOs are regulated rather up in the air, the joint venture between Securrency and ID DataWeb will help improve how ICOs are monitored. David Coxe, CEO of ID DataWeb, believes, “Quick and continuous identity verification paired with Dynamic Adaptive Authentication creates the level of trust that is needed to comply with KYC and AML regulations. ID DataWEb’s Attribute Exchange Network (AXN™) in conjunction with Securrency’s RegTech platform ensures the safety of PII and creates a quick and seamless authentication process that is necessary when working with cryptocurrency.”

Other partnerships

Securrency’s partnership with ID DataWeb also increases confidence in Securrecy’s platform and benefits the company when it pursues other alliances. Securrency recently notified the public that it would partner with the London Football Exchange (LFE), which wants to develop its own form of cryptocurrency that will create a “fan-driven football community” by providing members with exclusive access to tours, experiences, meet-and-greets, and more. Together, Securrency and ID DataWeb can help LFE resolve Know Your Transaction (KWT) for its audience.

Sam Robinson, partner at the law firm CMS that is overseeing LFE’s cryptocurrency launch, says, “It is very exciting to advice LFE on establishing a business that is aiming to have an impact on the entire football industry using blockchain technology.” Sports is certainly not the only industry that Securrency desires to help revolutionize, though—they are also dedicated supporters of farmers in developing worlds.

Securrency has already-established relationships with MIT and a company known as Ricult. Together, they “set a course for sustainable productivity by establishing a reliable supply chain for agricultural inputs and a secure, accessible micropayment infrastructure backed by Securrency’s low interest micro lending platform… securrency is breaking the cycle of subsistence farming by tripling the annual income of today’s farmer.” Their alliance with ID DataWeb has the potential to help further their social impact by helping investors who wish to provide micro loans and by mitigating fraud.

The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has created a bounty to encourage whistleblowers coming forward in exposing “pump-and-dump” schemes. “Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins,” the CFTC warned, “or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes. Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts.”

Pump-and-Dump Bounty

To eat at scammers’ anonymity at least, the CFTC is offering, “If you have original information that leads to a successful enforcement action that leads to monetary sanctions of $1 million or more, you could be eligible for a monetary award of between 10 percent and 30 percent.”

Customer Advisory: Beware Virtual Currency Pump-and-Dump Schemes is a two-page effort from the CFTC, “advising customers to avoid pump-and-dump schemes that can occur in thinly traded or new ‘alternative’ virtual currencies and digital coins or tokens.”

As these pages have long documented, scams and schemes of old are reappearing anew in a space filled with inexperienced investors. For those familiar with, say, the American stock market experience, boiler room cold calls of yore, penny stocks, hot tips, and sure things are all haunting phrases investors have encountered at one time or another.

The ubiquity of message boards and of stock trading websites only encouraged scammers in this regard. Price action moved on pumps, on posts and general chatter about the potential of a given stock only a few were privy. Greed did the rest. Regulatory bodies in the US have had enough time to see their likes come and go.

Old Wine, New Bottle

And while such scams seem new under the cloak of hip lingo such as cryptocurrency and blockchain and disruptive and game changer, it’s all pretty much the same old dance. Indeed, “Pump-and-dump schemes have been around long before virtual currencies and digital tokens. Historically, they were the domain of ‘boiler room’ frauds that aggressively peddled penny stocks by falsely promising the companies were on the verge of major breakthroughs, releasing groundbreaking products, or merging with blue chip competitors.”

The artifice of demand, such as it was, reflected in the price. “When the prices reached a certain point, the boiler rooms would dump their remaining shares on the open market, the prices would crash, and investors were left holding nearly worthless stock.” What might be slightly different in our present era is the relative sophistication and ability to hide true identities. And with basically one click, thousands of people can be reached rather easily.

For the broader ecosystem, self-regulation often happens in the form of news, Youtubers, message boards, and generally works itself out. Some enthusiasts insist it’s crypto’s charm, the engine of innovation, to police itself with heavy doses of caveat emptor. Part of the problem with accepting rat traps of the government regulatory body variety is what’s being invited. Running to Big Brother empowers Big Brother, a concept easily missed in the heat of pursuing justice. Often such bounties are used as metrics to buttress future enforcement budgets and to encourage more activist legislation. But these too are lessons this brave new world must learn anew.

The government of Malta has come up with an idea that businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies may find interesting. A new policy document seeks to set up a special agency which will “certify” blockchain platforms and “verify” crypto transactions. It is supposed to “bring peace of mind” to companies using these technologies to cut out central authorities and banks. Valletta also proposes legislation that will define the roles of intermediaries and regulate initial coin offerings.

Government Will Provide “Legal Certainty and Trust”

The new Malta Digital Innovation Authority will certify blockchain platforms used by companies in the country. It will also be responsible for “verifying” cryptocurrency transactions by checking if the logged information is genuine. The government hopes to bring some peace of mind to businesses using distributed ledgers for cross-border payments.

Authorities in Valletta are recognizing that companies utilize blockchains to cut out central authorities. However, they acknowledge that the technology allows for cheaper and more efficient money transfers. Worried that those platforms are not currently certified in any way, the government has decided to provide some “legal certainty and trust”. Officials believe companies will benefit from the work of the new authority, while also cutting out intermediaries such as banks.

The Parliamentary Secretary for the Digital Economy Silvio Schembri presented the new policy document at a press conference with various stakeholders, the Maltese Independent reported. He called the event a “historic moment” and provided further details on how authorities plan to implement regulations concerning the cryptocurrency sector in successive stages.

The first step will be to set up the Malta Digital Innovation Authority. A bill will set out the regime for the registration of service providers and the certification of technology arrangements, Schembri explained. On stage 2, another draft will formalize the framework for Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). A third law will impose regulation on services directly related to cryptocurrencies. Intermediaries like brokers, exchanges, wallet providers, asset managers, and investment advisors will be subjected to its provisions.

Malta Strives to Be a Hub of Innovation

Silvio Schembri stressed that promoting policies which favor the development of Malta as a hub for new technologies, including in the public sector, will be among the main goals. The aim is to foster innovation by creating a successful ecosystem, he added. That will be achieved through the “utilization of cutting edge technology in useful business cases and the adherence to best practices”. The lawmaker also noted that the Digital Innovation Authority would protect Malta’s reputation taking into account its international commitments under anti-money laundering directives.

During the press conference, officials mentioned several applications of distributed ledger technology. In larger companies, internal DTL platforms can be used to maintain payroll systems and record movement of goods and invoices. Businesses can also take advantage of public platforms that share consensus mechanisms such as bitcoin and ethereum. Regulated financial institutions can utilize DTLs to offer services to their clients.

The Parliamentary Secretary for the Digital Economy said the government would consult with all stakeholders before finalizing its policies, including relevant authorities like the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) and the police. Local and international representatives of the industry will also be involved in the process. Silvio Schembri added that the public is free to provide feedback in the next three weeks. After that, the bills will be introduced in the Parliament of Malta.

The social media campaign against crypto was carried out by Central Bank of Poland in conjunction with Polish Youtube partner network Gamellon, Google Ireland Limited, and Facebook Ireland Limited, allocating about 91,000 zloty (around $27,000) for producing anti-crypto content.

Money.pl reports that the Central Bank’s campaign also had videos published on the Planeta Faktów (Planet of Facts) Youtube channel, which has over 1.5 mln subscribers. Dubiel’s Youtube channel has over 900,000 subscribers.

Dubiel’s video makes no mention of the paid aspect of the Youtuber’s inspiration. Since Dec. 8, 2017, the Dubiel’s digital story of a young man who invests all his money in crypto only to lose it all has amassed over 500,000 views.

The description of the video contains the hashtag #uważajnakryptowaluty, which is the Polish Financial Supervision Authority and the Central Bank of Poland’s joint website dedicated to warnings against the use of cryptocurrencies.

The clip’s dramatic climax takes place in a restaurant when the main character can’t pay for his date’s meal with his new crypto investment, causing her to throw fiat money at him and storm out in a huff.

While problems with cryptocurrency-related online advertisements have recently emerged, with China allegedly banning all such ads from social media within the country, anti-crypto ads are more unusual.

After officially recognizing both trading and mining of cryptocurrencies in Feb. 2017, Poland seems to have stayed out of the crypto news cycle. However, after Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro announced the launch of a national cryptocurrency, the petro, Poland is reportedly one of the foreign investors willing to trade food and medicine for the new petro currency.

The bank has claimed that bitcoin will not be able to properly deal with a liquidity crisis in the event of an economic shock. In the US, when such shocks have occurred, central banks pump additional cash into the economy to address declines in lending and spending in the private sector. However, such a liquidity infusion would be close to impossible with bitcoin because there is no central institution that controls the network and the number of coins released each year is fixed at a certain rate. JP Morgan stated: “The ability to provide adequate liquidity is a hallmark of a well-functioning market, but more so during times of crisis.

“One benefit of fiat money is that it can be used to provide emergency liquidity from the outside. “This is the role central banks play as the lender-of-last resort."" However, Bitcoin backers hit back at the claims made by the bank, arguing that their case is built on the assumption that printing money to shore up an economy is something that is beneficial. Aaron Lasher, the chief marketing officer at cryptocurrency tech company Breadwallet, said: ""This is a classic case of creating the problem you offer to solve, and exactly why bitcoin exists.

""Why do we have the need for ""emergency liquidity"" in the first place?"" Mr Lasher hit out at the fact economies are based on fiat currency which can be printed at the whim of central bankers. Mr Lasher said: ”So banks have no incentives to manage liquidity risk precisely because the marginal cost of printing more dollars by the central banks is zero, providing a guaranteed backstop against sustaining losses incurred by excess risk taking.”

Arthur Hayes, the chief executive peer-to-peer crypto trading platform BitMEX, also argued that such policies ultimately translate into inflation in other financial assets. He said: ""If money printing solved the ills of economic collapse, Weimer Germany, Zimbabwe, and most recently Venezuela would be the most productive and economically sound societies on earth. Money printing delays the inevitable. ""Without the ability to print base money at all, any institutional that extended credit would be evaluated by the market on its ability to responsibly originate loans.""

Awareness of the most popular cryptocurrency has doubled since 2016, when 36 percent of German citizens were familiar with Bitcoin, and quadrupled since 2013, Bitkom reports.

According to this year’s survey, 4 percent of the 1,009 respondents actually own Bitcoin, 19 percent said that they have an idea of how to buy Bitcoin, and 72 percent stated they had no interest in the digital currency.

On the economic significance of cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, Bitkom CEO Bernhard Rohleder stated:

""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a good example of how the digital age is able to change the financial world. This is not so much about the individual currency itself as it is about the underlying blockchain technology. It will have an impact on the whole economy.”

As reported by Bitkom’s survey, the two main reasons cited by the 72 percent of Germans who have no interest in Bitcoin are risks from high price volatility and lack of knowledge of Bitcoin’s practical use.

On Monday, Feb. 12, the European Supervisory Authorities warned consumers that cryptocurrencies are “highly risky” assets that show “clear signs of a pricing bubble”.

Awareness of cryptocurrencies is high in Germany compared to some other countries. According to a Jan. 13 survey, more than 56 percent of Russians have heard of Bitcoin. In August 2017, Charles Xue, a Chinese-American billionaire investor, suggested that the vast majority of people in China, 70-80 percent, have never heard of Bitcoin.",,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/former-jpmorgan-trader-danny-master-on-trench-warfare-between-banking-and-crypto-2018-2-1016210950,"Global Advisors

Danny Masters ran JPMorgan's New York energy trading business in the 1990s before setting up his own commodities fund.

His firm pivoted to bitcoin in 2014 and he has been embracing crypto ever since.

Masters believes executives from traditional financial firms are trying to fight off crypto by dismissing it as a Ponzi scheme or a scam.

Crypto is ""a true financial revolution"", Masters says, and banks are ""paying the price"" for failing to innovate for decades.



LONDON — A former high-flying trader who has embraced the world of cryptocurrencies says there is a ""trench warfare"" going on between traditional financial services and digital upstarts.

Danny Masters told Business Insider: ""There’s something of a trench warfare going on between what I call analogue financial services companies and digital financial services companies.""

Masters began his career as an oil trader at Shell in the 1980s, rising to become head of JPMorgan's energy trading business in New York. He left in the late 1990s to set up his own commodities fund, Global Advisors.

Masters became interested in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies around five years ago and pivoted Global Advisors to focus on crypto in 2014. Shortly after, Global Advisors' bank HSBC ditched the business over fears that bitcoin could involve money laundering risks.

""We’ve gone from a renegade character to a more confusing animal for people to view,"" Masters told BI during an interview in London this week.

""The analogue financial services companies are not in this game at all. They don’t want to touch the core currency, which is bitcoin or ethereum, they’re suspicious about the industry itself. A lot of people think it’s a criminal enterprise and a Ponzi scheme and a scam.""

ECB executive board member Yves Mersch compared cryptocurrencies to a Ponzi scheme last week and the president of the World Bank and the head of the Bank for International Settlements have both called bitcoin a scam.

Masters said: ""In my mind, the cryptocurrency landscape is like the fog of war. You might be able to see the few people around you, you can see the hill over there, but very few people can see the whole landscape. We’re in a very fortunate position because we touch so many different parts of it. For us, it is abundantly clear that we are in the midst of a true financial revolution.""

'It is no longer acceptable to dismiss it'

Masters thinks that bankers are dismissive of cryptocurrencies because of the threat they pose to traditional banking. The crypto community is built on the principles of decentralization, displacing middlemen, and doing away with legacy systems.

""At the other end of the spectrum, we saw Charlie Munger only yesterday call bitcoin asinine. We heard Jamie Dimon call bitcoin a fraud. There are some very, very high profile — but usually, deeply legacy entrenched — people who are just out-right dismissive,"" Masters said.

""[Banks] have gone from dismissive, to unified in their resistance. Why? Why is something they ridiculed three months ago now something they feel the need to unite against and try and kill? There’s been a lot of aggressive things from banks.""

Global Advisors owns a 75% interest in Coinshares, another crypto investment business, and Coinshares announced two new funds in January that have a combined $1 billion in assets under management. Masters argues that stats like this increasingly validate his position and pose problems for traditionalists.

""The clock has lapsed, it is no longer acceptable to dismiss it. One of the biggest dismissers was Jamie Dimon. JPMorgan recently issued one of the largest reports on cryptocurrency yet seen."" Markets InsiderBitcoin rocketed over 1,500% against the dollar last year, leading to a surge in interest from professional investors. Exchange operators Cboe and CME both launched bitcoin futures contracts to tap into the demand, while Goldman Sachs is said to be considering setting up a bitcoin trading desks.

""If you’re going to argue for it, fine, if you’re going to argue against it, you better have some good reasons to do so,"" Masters said. ""People are struggling to come up with reasons to argue against it. They’re saying, it’s a load of crap and it’s worth nothing. It’s obviously not worth nothing.""

'Banks have sat on their laurels for 30 years'

Masters believes that the crypto world has now reached ""escape velocity"" and the ""analogue"" rivals won't be able to catch up or compete. In Masters telling, the new crypto reality will replace our current system.

""The problem with the analogue financial world is it’s become hamstrung and mired in a billion regulations,"" he said. ""Nobody enjoys working in it anymore, there’s just a tremendous amount of friction. I don’t think you can unpick that ball of knots, you have to start over again.

Thomson Reuters""Banks have sat on their laurels for 30 years. I just threw out my chequebook, it looks exactly the same as it did in 1985. Why should I still have it when I’m doing Uber instead of cabs, Airbnb instead of the Sheraton? They have absolutely failed to innovate in any way, shape, or form and now they’re paying the price.""

Despite a rocky start to the year, Masters thinks that the run-up in value seen in bitcoin and cryptocurrency last year is a hard-fought victory for all those who have been involved since the beginning.

""I got to know the crypto-anarchists many years ago and I was one of the very few financial people involved in the early days. It was a little scary actually. I felt a little self-conscious in some circles,"" Masters said.

""I’m thrilled for everybody in the space that has stuck to it for the last five years. 2014, after Mt. Gox, was a really miserable year. A lot of people fell off the boat at that time. Guys like Mike Hearn rage quit bitcoin when it was $400. Stripe has now given up bitcoin. There have been people who have lost the nerve along the way.

""You needed to be a true believer and you needed to suck it up for 2014, ‘15, and ‘16. And then ‘17 was just off the charts good.""

As cryptocurrency regulations start to pile up in India, a new trend is emerging for Indians to acquire cryptocurrencies from abroad, such as from relatives or friends with overseas accounts.

Increased Regulations

The Indian government has recently intensified its efforts to strengthen the country’s regulations on cryptocurrencies, promising that a regulatory framework for them will be announced soon. Earlier this month, the Indian tax authority issued notices to 100,000 crypto traders asking them to pay taxes.

The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee (BACC), an industry group whose members include 7 cryptocurrency exchanges, is considering several initiatives, such as creating a database of crypto users and transactions, to comply with the government’s mandates. The Times of India elaborated:

With Indian exchanges like Unocoin, Zebpay, Coinsecure, keen on increasing regulation and scrutiny into transactions, bitcoin aficionados say buying from US exchanges is a more popular alternative for purchases.

As regulations tighten in India, bitcoin “enthusiasts are now tapping into their own NRI [non-resident Indian] network of friends and family members,” the news outlet added.

L R Dinesh is a bitcoiner who buys expensive items using bitcoin on overseas online sites. He told the publication, “For the online tech community, there are some who receive bitcoins as payment for gadget and video game reviews. But for regular purchases, one has to get a relative or friend with an overseas account to send over bitcoins.”

Better Privacy

Dana L Coe, the CEO of bitcoin hardware wallet Bitlox, believes that one of the main attractions of bitcoin is privacy, the news outlet conveyed.

He explained, “If you are purchasing a particular medicine and someone collects the data and sells it to a pharmaceutical company — these companies can use sets of such demographic information to increase prices.” Furthermore, he noted, “Differential pricing, blanket invasion of privacy cannot happen if one uses anonymous and private payments,” adding:

People would want to shield their payments from the government, corporates or even their own families. With big data and consumer tracking websites, the need for privacy is heightened.

Better Security

The advanced security on purchases made with bitcoin is another major incentive for Indians, the publication added. “The requirement of Aadhaar is a dampener,” Dinesh asserted, referring to the 12-digit unique identity number issued to all Indian residents based on their biometric and demographic data. “The community of techies, bloggers and geeks are quite antipathic to the continuous stem of leaks and insecurities reported with Aadhaar,” he emphasized, noting that “To try and unite bitcoins with compliance is going to keep real bitcoin miners away from Indian exchanges.”

Damodharan Sampathkumar of Renovite Technologies was quoted:

In India, RBI has mandated two-factor authentication for all online transactions. But outside of India, only single-factor authentication is required. So when it comes to using one’s credit or debit card to buy products on overseas sites one also runs the risk of compromising sensitive financial data and hacks. So using bitcoins would add one layer of security.

But it may be set to steal a march over other markets. (See also: The Rise Of Africa.)

The surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies spurred the opening of at least 15 trading venues there within the past year alone. Peer-to-peer marketplaces also recorded a spike in trading volumes as bitcoin’s price skyrocketed last year. For example, trading volumes in Kenya on localbitcoins.com increased to $8.1 million in December 2017. Luno reported 2000 BTC worth of transactions in November 2017, when the cryptocurrency’s price was hovering in the $10,000 range. Approximately 37% of those transactions occurred in South Africa.

Recently, the continent’s oldest exchange disclosed lofty ambitions. Luno is a cryptocurrency exchange based in South Africa. It started operations in 2013 and boasts 1.5 million users spread across 40 countries. By 2025, it plans to reach 1 billion customers. For context, North America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported 11.7 million users last year. (See also: Coinbase Has More Users Than Schwab.)

There are a couple of reasons why Africa might become the next big market for cryptocurrencies.

First, local conditions in Africa are conducive to adoption of cryptocurrencies. Several countries in the continent suffer from rampant inflation. For example, Zimbabwe and South Sudan both have runaway inflation rates. (See also: Worst Hyperinflations In History.)

With their paradigm of decentralization, cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to disastrous central bank policies. In fact, South Africa’s central bank recently announced a pilot test using ethereum’s blockchain for smart contracts. Second, the penetration of mobiles within the continent has helped its population become comfortable with cryptocurrency technology. In the evolution of its financial services ecosystem, Africa skipped step involving the setup of physical banking infrastructure to a decentralized mobile money platform.

New businesses that use blockchain have emerged. Kenya-based BitPesa, a payment platform and money transfer service, works with 60 banks around Africa and has seven mobile wallets on its platform. Third, the threat of government regulation, which has roiled cryptocurrency markets recently, is currently fairly low in Africa. While they have warned about the dangers of investing in cryptocurrencies, regulators in African countries have taken a hands-off approach to trading at exchanges.

But Africa is susceptible to the same pressures as other cryptocurrency markets. Cryptocurrency traders in Africa were paying a premium of as much as 40 percent in 2017 as bitcoin’s price reached new records. According to some reports, the premium occurred due to a shortage of liquidity, meaning sellers were able to command unrealistically high prices due to high demand from buyers.

Alexia Hefti, blockchain tax lead at Deloitte, said it's a common misconception that you only have to report your gains when you trade cryptocurrency back into Canadian dollars.

Another misconception is that people actively trading cryptocurrencies don't need to record those trades.

""A lot of Canadians this year have been trading different types of cryptocurrencies — so for example bitcoin to ether, ether to litecoin, and so on — each of those transactions is a disposition of property and is taxable,"" Hefti said.

No different than a stock portfolio

Dennis Domazet, partner in charge of Deloitte's blockchain practice in Canada, said Canadian taxpayers are subject to tax on their worldwide income.

""As a starting point, everybody should approach… any sort of profit making activity as taxable,"" Domazet said.

The way cryptocurrency holdings will be dealt in your taxes with will vary depending on how you used it. People actively trading cryptocurrencies, for example, will have to use different reporting methods than people using it to make purchases, or simply holding it.

To prepare for taxes, you'll need to list when you purchased the cryptocurrency; when you sold it and what you sold it for; or if you exchanged it for another cryptocurrency, what you exchanged it for. Many crypto exchanges will provide users with this information.

Domazet said the current tax rules for investing can be applied to cryptocurrency investments.

""It's really no different than somebody who has a complex stock portfolio,"" Domazet said.

The problem of definition

The CRA declined to speak to the CBC for this article, but they said in a statement that they classify digital currencies as commodities, and that any time you use cryptocurrency to pay for goods or services, it's considered a barter transaction.

Cloudesley Hobbs is the chief legal officer of Dominion Bitcoin Mining Company, and one of ""very few"" lawyers in Canada specializing in cryptocurrency law.

He thinks Canada Revenue Agency needs to clarify the definition of cryptocurrencies.

When the government first classified digital currency as a commodity in 2013, there were only a handful of coins. Today, there are thousands, and not all of them work like the earliest few.

""Cryptocurrencies... are not exactly all the same flavour,"" Hobbs said.

He said bitcoin is handled predominantly as a commodity, while ethereum acts more as an agreement for processing power on the ethereum blockchain, which is more like a service contract.

More complications ensue if you hold your bitcoin in a third-party wallet based in whole or in part in a foreign country — then it might be considered foreign property.

""Without some further clarification from the CRA in terms of how those transactions are going be dealt with, it's left the public in a little bit of a grey zone.""

'Grossly underreported'

Hobbs said in the United States, cryptocurrency gains are ""grossly underreported,"" but the Internal Revenue Service is pushing for change.

In November 2017, the IRS tapped the cryptocurrency exchange CoinBase to release client information for more than 14,000 customers.

Similar action could be taken in Canada, Hobbs said.

Cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, but they're not untraceable, and any exchange that has your information may be compelled to give it up.

""Technically, I would say that your duty is to report all forms of income to Revenue Canada and that cryptocurrencies are taxable, so the proper stance should be advising the CRA of any cryptocurrency holdings a person may have for tax purpose.""

Canadian accountants can apply current tax rules for investments to the cyptocurrency sphere, or if you're doing your own taxes and you're not sure how to handle your digital currency investments, Hobbs recommends using the CRA's voluntary disclosure program.",

Bipartisan momentum is growing in the Senate and House of Representatives for action to address the risks posed by virtual currencies to investors and the financial system, they said.

Even free-market Republican conservatives, normally wary of government red tape, said regulation could be needed if cryptocurrencies threaten the U.S. economy.

“There’s no question about the fact that there is a need for a regulatory framework,” said Republican Senator Mike Rounds, a Senate Banking Committee member.

Digital assets currently fall into a jurisdictional gray area between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and individual states.

Much of the concern on Capitol Hill is focused on speculative trading and investing in cryptocurrencies, leading some lawmakers to push for digital assets to be regulated as securities and subject to the SEC’s investor protection rules.

Crypto Casino Inside the booming, risky world of cryptocurrencies

“The SEC is properly the lead on the issue,” said Republican Representative Bill Huizenga, chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets which will hold hearings on the issue in coming weeks.

Huizenga said the recent growth of the virtual currency market had made him more comfortable with more oversight. “Six months ago, we didn’t see this explosion. The marketplace has changed,” he said.

Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, is another lawmaker advocating for direct oversight of digital assets by the SEC.

“A lot of people don’t realize there’s nothing backing these virtual currencies,” she said.

ALARM BELLS

Virtual currencies have existed for years but speculation in them has recently ballooned, along with scams promising investors returns of over 1,000 percent in weeks.

In a time of volatile markets, hackers are also active in the sector, stealing $530 million of digital currency from Japanese exchange Coincheck last month.

Bitcoin, the best known virtual currency, lost over half its value earlier this year after surging more than 1,300 percent.

“We have to look carefully at all of the cryptocurrencies and make sure individuals don’t get taken advantage of,” said Representative Tom MacArthur, a House Financial Services Committee Republican.

Regulators globally have raised the alarm over cryptocurrencies, saying they may aid money laundering and terrorist financing, hurt consumers and undermine trust in the global financial system.

France and Germany want cryptocurrencies on the agenda for the upcoming G20 meeting of the largest advanced and developing economies.

Conservative Republicans also recognize the potential for broader risks.

“I’m a total free-marketer, so I don’t want to regulate,” said Republican Representative Dave Brat, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.

“But if it’s a currency that could destabilize the whole economy, you’re going to have that conversation,” he said.

SECURITY OR COMMODITY?

The SEC and CFTC chairmen recently called for greater scrutiny of digital assets before the Senate Banking Committee. Members of the panel said the regulators will return to discuss how to move forward.

While many lawmakers agree tighter oversight is needed, there is no consensus yet in Congress on how to proceed.

While some lawmakers say speculative investments should be classed as securities, others want digital currency transactions regulated as commodities.

The SEC is already cracking down on transactions known as initial coin offerings (ICOs), while the CFTC has identified digital assets as a commodity subject to its anti-fraud rules.

Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at the Coin Center, a member of the growing cryptocurrency lobby, said lawmakers need to distinguish between ICOs that operate like securities and other virtual currencies including bitcoin, which he described as a commodity like gold.

Senator Rounds told Reuters there was an opportunity to regulate cryptocurrencies as both a security and a commodity.

But while lawmakers are keen to mitigate the risks digital assets may pose, they are also mindful of the need to protect innovation, including the underlying distributed ledger technology, said Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a member of the Senate Banking Committee.

“The goal here is to have rules of the road that protect consumers without trying to squash innovation.”",2018-02-21 12:27:19+00:00,https://www.fool.com/taxes/2018/02/19/get-ready-to-laugh-heres-how-many-americans-have-r.aspx,"Whether you're ready or not, we're right in the thick of tax season.

For many Americans, tax season is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, preparing your taxes can often be a confusing, tedious, and borderline hair-pulling experience. Prior to overhauling the tax code via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will factor into your tax filing next year, the U.S. tax code had been expanding by an average of 144,500 words a year for roughly six decades. This made keeping up with tax law changes almost impossible, even with the assistance of a tax professional or tax software.

On the other hand, tax season usually sees tens of millions of Americans walk away with an average federal refund of between $2,700 and $3,100. Though getting a large refund is often not a smart move, this money typically goes a long way to boosting savings rates, as well as fueling sales growth at retailers, which helps the consumption-driven U.S. economy.

Taxpayers are doing a really bad job of reporting cryptocurrency transactions

This year, however, there's a relatively new complication for taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service to be wary of: cryptocurrency capital gains. You see, the IRS considers digital currencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin to be property. That means when they're bought and sold, you should be claiming profits and losses as a short-term or long-term capital gains or losses, depending on how long the investment was held (short-term holdings include everything held for 365 or fewer days). Rarely, though, are these transactions reported.

According to data from the IRS, between 800 and 900 taxpayers per year reported cryptocurrency capital gains on their federal income-tax filings between 2013 and 2015. Yet, based on a recent IRS legal victory over cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, over 14,300 people traded in excess of $20,000 worth of bitcoin between 2013 and 2015. While not all of these folks may have made money, it certainly suggests that potentially less than 10% of those investors have accurately reported their profits to the federal government.

But if you think this filing rate is terrible, you haven't seen anything yet.

Get ready to laugh...

As Reuters reported on Feb. 13, fewer than 100 people out of the 250,000 individuals to have completed their federal tax filing through Credit Karma this year have reported cryptocurrency transactions to the IRS. That's less than 0.04% of all taxpayers. Understandably, virtual currencies aren't the easiest to invest in since users have to make purchases on decentralized exchanges, so this figure wouldn't be expected to be that high. Still, a 2,000-person survey from credit score start-up and research firm Qualtrics in January found that 57% of those Americans it surveyed had recognized some gains from cryptocurrencies. Fifty-seven percent versus less than 0.04% simply doesn't add up.

Why the massive discrepancy in these percentages? Well, it's not out of the question that those taxpayers with more complex filing situations are waiting to file later in the tax season, or are in the process of reconciling a year's worth of financial data.

Furthermore, it's not guaranteed that cryptocurrency exchanges will supply their users with profit and loss statements, or statements that provide a cost basis. And if they do, it's unclear if those members have received those detailed profit and loss statements as of Feb. 13. There really is no precedent to digital currencies, and since cryptocurrency users' identities have the potential to be obfuscated or conducted under pseudonyms, it makes tracing a transaction back to an individual difficult to nearly impossible.

There's also the real possibility that taxpayers are blatantly committing tax fraud by not reporting their transactions, crossing their fingers, and hoping for the best. A LendEDU survey in November of 564 bitcoin investors found that only 64% intended to report their capital gains or losses on their 2017 taxes. Essentially, it means more than a third purposely plan to commit tax fraud.

The IRS and Congress step up cryptocurrency capital-gain enforcement

Being well aware of the complications cryptocurrencies present, the IRS and Congress are beginning to put their foot down. As noted, the IRS won a legal case against Coinbase that gave it information on more than 14,300 users who may have evaded paying capital gains tax. But the biggest change arguably comes from Congress.

The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December killed a long-standing cryptocurrency tax loophole known as the like-kind exchange, as of Jan. 1. Before that date, cryptocurrency investors could exchange their bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, or other virtual tokens for other virtual tokens without paying capital gains tax. They were making what was considered a ""like-kind exchange."" However, the new tax code replaced the word ""property"" with the phrase ""real property,"" meaning any exchange of one digital currency for another would count as a capital gain or loss, and it would have to be reported.

It also meant that users would have to report capital gains if using their virtual currencies to buy goods or services. Imagine you purchased $1,000 worth or bitcoin, and bitcoin goes up in value. If you use $100 worth of your bitcoin on a good or service, the IRS will be expecting you to pay capital gains tax on that purchase. It's a complicated, but very much needed, modification to like-kind exchanges and cryptocurrency tax law.

It'll certainly be interesting to see how many taxpayers report cryptocurrency capital gains when all is said and done this tax season.",2018-02-19,https://news.bitcoin.com/youve-scammed-cryptocurrency-probably-fault/,"If You’ve Been Scammed Out of Cryptocurrency It’s Probably Your Fault

Scammers are a dastardly, low down bunch. Preying on the gullible, extorting the vulnerable, and hoodwinking the hoodwinkable with their promise of free bitcoin if you send a little first and daily interest on your Bitconnect loan. It’s an indisputable fact that if the cryptocurrency space were cleansed of scammers, the web would be a better place. It’s also a fact that if you’ve been scammed of cryptocurrency, it’s probably your fault.

Who You Gonna Call?

The biggest cause of crypto scams isn’t shady operators from impoverished countries. It isn’t Russian hackers with leet phishing skills and it isn’t conniving con artists pawning spammy links. No, the biggest cause of cryptocurrency scams is greed. And not their greed – yours. If you lost money in Bitconnect or Davorcoin or to an email phishing scam or to “Vitalik Buterin” promising you free ETH on Twitter, you’re not the victim – you’re the culprit.

If people didn’t keep taking the bait, scammers wouldn’t keep scamming. If no one bought into Bitconnect, Bitconnect couldn’t have exited with millions of dollars. If you want to get rich off crypto, put some money into three major cryptocurrencies you believe in, store them on a hardware wallet and forget about it for five years. Come 2023, you could be rich, you could be poor or you could be somewhere in between but one thing you won’t be is scammed.

Unfortunately, many crypto investors seem to have adopted the 50 Cent mantra of “Get rich or die tryin’”. When the shit hits the fan, instead of recognizing their foolishness and wising up, they lash out, blaming anyone and everyone. It’s Twitter’s fault for permitting lookalike accounts. It’s regulators’ fault for not cracking down on these chancers. It’s ICOs fault for allowing scammers in their channel. It’s the media’s fault for causing FUD, forcing Bitconnect to withdraw their stellar lending service. No, it’s your fault. No one else’s. Yours.

A Plea of Mitigation

Let’s be clear though: victims of cryptocurrency scams – no matter how naive or avaricious they may have been – don’t deserve ridicule. There is no poetic justice in watching the greedy get deprived of the very thing they crave, and there is no satisfaction in watching scammers walk away with millions of stolen ether. It’s possible to feel a twinge of sympathy for victims whilst also feeling that they brought it on themselves. But sympathy won’t get their money back. Nor will encouraging them to go crying to their Congressman. The only way to stop this sort of stuff from happening is to tell it like it is. So here goes:

Stop taking the bait. Stop buying into schemes that look too good to be true. And stop encouraging your friends and relatives to buy into them too. Cos if there’s any subset of victims who don’t deserve the fate, it’s those who were lured into the Ponzi scheme by people they trusted. There’s a steep learning curve with cryptocurrency. Anyone entering the space for the first time can be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed and ill-informed. That’s why it’s important to get the lie of the land before jumping in with both feet. Buy some bitcoin. Purchase a Crypto Kitty. But don’t, under any circumstances, enter into coins, schemes, and ICOs you don’t understand and haven’t researched.

Astonishingly, a vigilante group set up to track down the Bitconnect scammers is now seeking to fund its operations by holding an ICO for its own Justice Coin, which features a “daily profit bot” promising 2% daily returns. Less astonishingly, some of the victims of Bitconnect will buy into it and get scammed again – possibly by the very same people behind Bitconnect. In an information age where the answer to “Is this a scam?” is never more than a google away, there’s no excuse for getting duped. If you’ve been scammed out of cryptocurrency, it’s probably your fault.

Many readers probably even know people who have made lots of money with cryptocurrencies.

However, it's important to be cautious when approaching a new and volatile asset class like cryptocurrencies. Perhaps the best way to invest in this area isn't with cryptocurrencies themselves, but with another method.

1. Stocks with cryptocurrency or blockchain investments

To be clear, I'm not talking about buying stocks like Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), or any other company that suddenly became a ""blockchain"" or ""cryptocurrency"" company after the 2017 surge in popularity.

Instead, a smart way to play cryptocurrency is with stocks that could make lots of money if cryptocurrencies remain popular but will be just fine if they don't. Square (NYSE:SQ) is perhaps my favorite example. Square recently enabled bitcoin buying and selling for users of its Square Cash app, charging no fees and making bitcoin purchases as easy as swiping a few times on your mobile phone's screen.

If bitcoin's popularity continues to explode, there could be a big revenue stream available for Square (while there are no fees, there's still a spread between the buy and sell prices). However, if bitcoin fizzles out, as many people predict, Square's rapidly growing small-business finance ecosystem will continue to thrive.

2. A blockchain ETF

This is a similar idea to buying stocks of companies with cryptocurrency-related investments, but instead of just choosing one, you invest in dozens of them. Recently, there have been a few ""blockchain"" exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that have come to the market. While these are relatively new, they invest in companies such as Overstock.com, Intel, Cisco, NVIDIA, and Square, just to name a few.

Be sure to check the fee structure before you invest in a blockchain ETF, but these can certainly be ways to invest in cryptocurrencies while simultaneously buying well-established businesses.

3. Futures

This is close to buying actual cryptocurrencies, but with some notable differences. Bitcoin futures are listed on CME Group and Cboe Global Markets and are available through several major online brokerages to retail investors.

Basically, a futures contract allows you to bet on the future price of a commodity or asset by putting up some money now -- known as the margin requirement. For bitcoin futures, the margin requirements vary depending on the exchange and your broker, but they're generally in the 40% range.

For a simplified example, let's say bitcoin was trading for $10,000 and you wanted to ""bet"" that the price will go higher between now and April. You could buy a futures contract by putting up $4,000 per bitcoin, based on a 40% margin requirement, and ""own"" the profits if bitcoin rises. If you want to bet against bitcoin, you can put up $4,000 and profit if the price falls.

To be clear, I don't recommend futures trading for novice investors, or to anyone who really doesn't understand how futures work. However, if you're interested, my colleague Jordan Wathen wrote an excellent explanation of bitcoin futures when they first rolled out in December.

Ways not to play cryptocurrencies

Finally, there are a few ways investors can play cryptocurrencies indirectly that should be avoided at all costs.

I already mentioned Riot Blockchain and similar companies, many of which don't have a profitable business and have some sketchy business practices, to put it mildly.

There's also the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC:GBTC), which is the closest thing to a bitcoin ETF currently on the market. The idea is that the trust takes investors' money and pools it to invest in bitcoin, but shares trade at a massive premium to the value of the bitcoin the trust actually owns. You're better off buying actual bitcoins on an exchange than investing in them through this trust.

The bottom line is that there are several ways to invest in cryptocurrencies without buying them. Some are a good idea, while others should be avoided. I believe that the best way to play the cryptocurrency mania is with well-established, growing companies that have other business functions, in case the crypto-frenzy fizzles out.",2018-02-19,https://internetofbusiness.com/33164-2/,"Get ready to “Flip your coin”: Florida-based technology company NXT-ID has unveiled a new contactless payment device for cryptocurrencies.

Flip allows customers to pay for items with Bitcoin if a vendor accepts near-field communication (NFC) transactions. The device uses FitPay, the contactless payments system for wearables and IoT devices developed by the NXT-ID subsidiary of the same name.

In a recent interview with InvestorIdeas, NXT-ID boss Gino Pereira boss explained, “Flip is a product under which we provide a crypto-wallet, in which individuals can deposit bitcoin. Bitcoin is converted into what is essentially a prepaid debit card, which is then available for use to spend as cash anywhere that accepts NFC payments.”

To begin with, Flip will only accept bitcoin and US dollars when it launches in Q2 2018 (the company will accept pre-orders later this month). But Pereira said that if the rollout goes as planned, Flip will be expanded to accept other cryptocurrencies and payment options.

“We anticipate that will widen as we go forward with our development, but our initial offering is limited to US currency and bitcoin,” he told Investorideas.

The company is ploughing more money into blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, he said.

Volatile market

While extravagant claims have been made for cryptocurrencies creating an alternative, distributed financial system of the future, the market is extremely volatile. At the time of writing, one bitcoin is worth roughly $10,000, after hitting a high of $20,000 earlier this year.

Pereira said he is aware of the uncertainty, but believes cryptocurrencies have enormous future potential.

“There’s obviously a lot of volatility and it’s very early on so there are a number of question marks over it,” he said. “But with the basic concept of blockchain and security, and cryptocurrencies, we believe they are here to stay as part of the overall payment ecosystem.”

NXT-ID has recently formed a partnership with GPS systems maker, Garmin. “We have a number of other arrangements with IoT manufacturers, which will probably be announced as they’re closer to launching their products,” said Pereira.

Internet of Business says

The deep connections between blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and the IoT should now be clear, and a world is emerging in which human beings can spend or receive money seamlessly within smart environments.

For example, this excellent Internet of Business report on positioning systems explores a number of case studies, in which people pay for bikes as they ride them around town, or receive their wages in micro-payments whenever they’re in the workplace. Meanwhile in China, shoppers are able to pay for goods by smiling at face-recognition systems, using technology provided by Face++.

However, while many of these systems are exciting, and reveal the dismantling of a unit-based system in favour of always-on services – even for physical goods, which we may never purchase outright in future – we should beware of investing too much power in distributed ledgers.

Consider this: A world in which people are only paid for being in a specific location may also be one in which people never leave that location. The implications of that will need careful consideration in order to ensure that distributed, decentralised systems benefit everyone – as they are designed to do.

Proposals to introduce tax exemptions for companies using blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency have been put on the table in Spain. The ruling People’s Party is preparing new legislation that will also offer incentives to entrepreneurs raising funds through ICOs. If lawmakers adopt the amendments, investors will not be required to report crypto assets under certain threshold.

In Spain’s Interest

Teodoro Garcia Egea, a deputy from Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s party who is working on the bill, thinks that it is in Spain’s interest to attract companies using blockchains. He insists “the technology is a driver for business” in industries such as finance, health and education. “We hope to get the legislation ready this year”, the lawmaker told Bloomberg, pointing out that the level of digitalization will be key for Spanish companies.

The People’s Party intends to seek experts’ advice to finalize and push through the legislation in parliament. The ruling majority will also study developments in other countries that have advanced further in adopting their legal frameworks. Switzerland was mentioned as an example in that respect. The Alpine country has already become a leader in Europe, after establishing a Crypto Valley in Zug and enacting guidelines on initial coin offerings (ICOs).

The authors of the bill are considering proposals to entice businessmen to use blockchain for crowd fundraising through ICOs. The draft also introduces tax breaks for small companies specializing in sectors such as 3D printing or data processing. According to Garcia Egea, these incentives will be offered as rebates.

The new legislation may also include a threshold below which entrepreneurs would not be required to report a cryptocurrency investment. Authorities are working on provisions to protect crypto investors. They will be prepared by Spain’s markets and securities regulator. “We want to set up Europe’s safest framework to invest in ICOs” the Spanish deputy said.

Impossible to Explain Without Bitcoin

In a post published on his website in December, Teodoro Garcia Egea attempted to win support for his ideas by educating the public about blockchain technology. He compares it to the institution of the public notary. “A notary is a highly qualified and independent professional, who provides guarantees for security and legality”, the lawmaker notes. In Internet, these characteristics can be attributed to blockchains, he says.

The blockchain technology does not replace the notary, but provides reliability, transparency and traceability for contracts between individuals beyond what notaries can do, Garcia Egea writes. Blockchains do not replace the services of legal professionals. From regulatory point of view, the blockchain technology is not a threat but a great opportunity to do a better job, the lawmaker says.

Garcia Egea also points out how difficult it is to explain what exactly blockchain is, what its applications are, and what problems it can solve. “We cannot explain this new set of tools without making a reference to bitcoin” the deputy says. Who would argue with that?

7.30 has obtained the latest figures from the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission's (ACCC) Scamwatch, showing it received 1,289 complaints related to bitcoin in 2017, with reported losses totalling $1,218,206.

The corporate regulator, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), has issued a warning to would-be investors.

""These are quite speculative products and they can be quite high-risk,"" ASIC commissioner John Price told 7.30.

""It's been quite well documented that some of these products are scams, so please don't invest unless you're prepared to lose some or all of your money.""

Unregulated exchanges are also a problem.

Investor Akram Bekzada says he was burnt by a bitcoin exchange called Igot.

In 2014 he plunged the equivalent of about $20,000 into bitcoin, using Igot to make his transactions.

When the price dropped and he decided to sell, the transaction didn't go through.

""Nobody wants to get their money stolen, so yeah, it's not a good feeling,"" he said.

Mr Bekzada says he and dozens of others have been chasing their money ever since, with little help from authorities.

""Everyone expected so much more of Australian authorities,"" he said.

""One of the main selling points of Igot was that they're an Australian entity, and this is how they advertised, this is how they got a lot of people's trust.

""Many of the customers are dumbfounded as to why nothing has been done.""

While it appears online that Igot has a new name — Bitlio — a lawyer for Bitlio told 7.30 the companies are not the same.

7.30 was unable to get any comment from Igot.

Bitlio says it offered to transfer cryptocurrencies from Igot to online tokens that are tradeable on the Bitlio exchange, but some Igot customers have failed to convert their holdings.

Bitlio also says 90 per cent of Igot's customers have transferred their holdings to Bitlio, and Bitlio has acted reasonably in its dealings with Igot's customers.

Regulatory crackdown

It is opaque dealings like these that have prompted legislative reform to crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges.

From April, cryptocurrency exchanges will have to register with Australia's financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC, and report on their customers and the transactions they make.

The new federal minister for cyber security, Angus Taylor, has welcomed the move.

""We've had a lot of cooperation from the cryptocurrencies because they know they need to be legitimate, they know they need to be part of our financial system, and they know they don't want to be facilitating illegal and criminal activity,"" he said.

While it's come almost 10 years after the invention of bitcoin, Mr Taylor told 7.30 that Australia was still ahead of the pack.

""We've acted early, we've acted much earlier than many other countries around the world,"" he said.

""Obviously cryptocurrencies are growing, and it's appropriate that the Government establish a regulatory framework with a particular focus on criminal activity.""

AUSTRAC's Brad Brown said there is still a threat of cryptocurrencies being used to finance organised crime and terrorism.

""There is a definite risk of digital currencies being misused for money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crimes within the Australian environment,"" he told 7.30.

The recent volatility on the share market looks like nothing compared to the wild swings on the market for cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin has lost about half of its value over the past month, and while it's still up 878 per cent on last year, there's constant talk of whether the bitcoin bubble is about to burst.

Computer programmer James Cole recently sold his software start-up business, and as his next venture gets off the ground he's been day trading cryptocurrencies.

He started by investing a few thousand dollars in 2013 and watched his portfolio grow to almost $200,000.

But then, in January, the market crashed.

""Probably wiped about $110,000 off my portfolio in the space of 24 hours,"" Mr Cole told 7.30.

""Not a great thing to wake up to in the morning.""

He's still well ahead on his initial investment, and his recent losses are only on paper. But the recent volatility has prompted other bitcoin investors to sell up.

Bitcoin investor Toby Halligan recently sold off most of his coins. ( ABC New: Vince Tucci )

""There have certainly been a couple of moments where I took the wrong punt,"" said radio DJ and comedian Toby Halligan, who bought his first cryptocurrencies in 2013.

""There are moments where I made $1,200 over the course of an hour and was excited, and then I lost $1,500 over the course of half an hour.""

Mr Halligan sold most of his remaining coins just weeks ago.

""I think you remember the losses much more than the gains. You remember your bad decisions much more than your good decisions, and the fluctuations are kind of exhausting,"" he told 7.30.

Still confused about bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the best known cryptocurrency.

When it began trading in 2009 it was worth almost nothing, but at its peak late last year one bitcoin was worth almost US$20,000.

Crytocurrencies like bitcoin exist only online and use digital data known as blockchain to record every transaction and make sure it's secure.

Those transactions are checked by other users, called bitcoin miners.

Importantly, the whole process is decentralised and there are no banks involved.

""The potential for it, I think, is huge,"" Mr Cole said.

""The current coins that exist at the moment may or may not last in the long term, but the really exciting thing for me is [it's] a new way of storing value and ownership.""",2018-02-19,,,

Gun control? Russia? Health care? Members of the US House of Representatives and Senate in both parties tend to differ, and often vehemently. Similar to issues of national security and war, however, it appears cryptocurrency regulation is decidedly less divisive. Both traditionally pro-market Republicans and open-minded Democrats are producing bipartisan rhetoric in support of federal legislation to tame the crypto revolution.

Also read: Switzerland Enacts ICO Guidelines

Crypto Regulation Rhetoric Is Bipartisan

Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat, walked a tight rhetorical line on the burgeoning cryptocurrency phenomenon, saying, “The goal here is to have rules of the road that protect consumers without trying to squash innovation.”

Cynics have long contended both political wings in the United States are part of the same sick bird. They seem to have differences, responding to various constituencies with requisite amounts of intensity, but when it comes to guns and butter, and especially butter, cosmetic differences are set aside and a strange uniformity kicks in.

Republican Senator Mike Rounds told Reuters, “There’s no question about the fact that there is a need for a regulatory framework.” Indeed, at an open hearing under the auspice of Senator Rounds’ committee, both Chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) were decidedly agnostic on extending their own powers, but in agreement future focus would need to be placed upon cryptocurrencies specifically. Whether that came in the form of a dedicated and separate agency or some hybrid within existing institutions is all up for grabs.

Calls for regulation seemed to dry as bitcoin tumbled some 60 percent recently, signaling to those less literate in crypto such markets were ending in a natural death. However, across the board cryptocurrencies are rebounding, showing a resilience troubling to lawmakers. “The SEC is properly the lead on the issue. Six months ago, we didn’t see this explosion. The marketplace has changed,” Republican House member Bill Huizenga noticed. His committee is taking up the issue of crypto regulation next month, and he’s on record as supporting oversight.

Election Season Is On and Cracking

Adding to US regulatory fever is an off-year election this November. The entire 435 lower legislative body, the House of Representatives, is up for reelection, and Republicans hold a slim and narrowing majority. A third of the US Senate’s 100 member chamber is also up, and Republicans hold a slight lead there as well. With a Republican President set for two more years after, both parties see this November as a chance to alter political fortunes. American politicians typically hit on easier targets, and crypto’s considerable bad press, linking it to crime and fraud, might be just a topic to gain the electorate’s attention.

”A lot of people don’t realize there’s nothing backing these virtual currencies,” warned House Democrat Carolyn Maloney. Congresswoman Maloney wishes to expand SEC jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies.

Republican House member Tom MacArthur cautioned, “We have to look carefully at all of the cryptocurrencies and make sure individuals don’t get taken advantage of.”

House Freedom Caucus member Republican Dave Brat gave an equivocation, “I‘m a total free-marketer, so I don’t want to regulate, but if it’s a currency that could destabilize the whole economy, you’re going to have that conversation.”

The White House, for its part, has expressed worry with regard to bitcoin and crime, but it hasn’t put forth any policy proposals as of yet. Asked about the prospects for a federal regulation agenda emanating from the Oval Office, Special Assistant to the President Rob Royce explained, “I think we’re still absolutely studying and understanding what the good ideas and bad ideas in that space are. So I don’t think it’s close.”

 -- One of Silicon Valley’s latest stars isn’t on television or a music mogul. His name is Jeremy Gardner, dubbed a cryptocelebrity.

One source of his riches? Bitcoin.

Gardner, who calls himself a venture capitalist and cryptocurrency evangelist, even lives in a San Francisco house known as the Crypto Castle.

“When my startup first moved to San Francisco, we lived in a dingy two-bedroom apartment with six people and we called it the ‘bitcoin basement,’” Gardner, 26, told ABC News during a tour of the three-bedroom house he now shares with other diehard cryptocurrency believers.

“When we found a new house with spectacular views that really feel castle-like, Crypto Castle made sense. Little did I know it would become such a well-known name,” he added.

Imagine a dorm room combined with a think tank with a revolving door of “cryptonomads.” One notable guest, he says, was Vitalik Buterin, the 24-year-old founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum who’s reportedly worth more than $400 million.

If residents prefer, Gardner will accept rent payment in bitcoin, meaning the $1,600 rent could fluctuate with the volatility of the cryptocurrency.

“I ran out of USD [U.S. dollars] and needed a place to live, so I knew Jeremy would let me pay rent in crypto,” Jinglan Wang, a cryptonomad and executive director of the Blockchain Education Network, said.

What exactly is bitcoin?

The cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to control its creation and secure transactions, independent of a central bank. The encryption techniques make it notably difficult to create any kind of counterfeit.

“Bitcoin is pretty much like cash for the Internet,” according to bitcoin.org.

People can purchase bitcoins or fractions of a bitcoin through online exchanges or from an individual and store them in a virtual wallet.

“If you hold a U.S. dollar, the value really comes from a belief that the Federal Reserve, the central bank, won't print too many other dollars,” finance professor David Yermack of the New York University Stern School of Business said.

“In the case of bitcoin and other digital currencies, you're really relying on the mathematics and probabilities behind them that provide the basis for security that you believe that there won't be too many issued because you can see the equations and the criteria for adding more units of currency,” added Yermack, who also teaches a course on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

There is a finite amount of bitcoin, only 21 million, that can ever be created, which is achieved through a virtual process called “mining.” Mining has been likened to gold mining; the more that is mined, the more difficult it is to find.

Bitcoin mining requires a special computer program that is used to compete with other miners to solve complicated mathematical problems.

Several companies, from Expedia to Overstock.com, have started accepting bitcoin for payment. Every bitcoin transaction is recorded in a secure, public, digital ledger called “the blockchain.”

“The logic of a blockchain is that you have records of data that are stored in blocks, and the blocks are arranged in a sequence such that the prior block is an input to the next block.” Yermack said.

Yermack cited the security of blockchain technology as one of the biggest benefits of bitcoin. The blockchain is “extremely resistant to hacking and sabotage in a way that the current financial system really is no,” he said.

Other benefits, Yermack said, include the speed and low cost of transferring.

“It's much cheaper and quicker than the financial system that we have now,” he said. “Typically, if you pay for something with a Visa card, there's a fee in the background, paid usually by the merchant, but it drives up the cost of the transaction about 3 percent. There's no 3 percent fee like that for bitcoin.”

He added: “It's also quite quick that in terms of transferring money especially across borders sometimes it can take days just to send money from London to New York. But in the case of a bitcoin transaction, it can occur almost instantly, as quickly as the network moves the traffic.”

At its inception in 2009, a bitcoin could be purchased for less than a penny. Since then, the price has grown exponentially, hitting an all-time high of $19,783 in December. The cryptocurrency has experienced extreme volatility recently, leaving skeptics to question its sustainability.

“Bitcoin wasn’t built to handle the volume of transactions that people are trying to do with it,” Grant Sabatier, who runs Millionaire Money, an investment blog, told “Nightline.”

Its volatility makes it difficult to use as currency and is probably better used as a store of value, like gold, he added.

Sabatier, who made more than $1 million in bitcoin, has been advising people against putting their money in the cryptocurrency.

“If you only have $1,500 [to invest], this is not the best place to put your money,” Sabatier said. “This is speculative … it's gambling. You could lose money. You could make money. But, overall, you need to have a more conservative, better investment strategy for the long term.

“Keep it in perspective,” he said. “View it as a speculative investment. Why would you put your entire investment in something that isn’t backed by anything?”

Gardner, the cryptocurrency evangelist, understands such skepticism but said he believes bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

“Look at the U.S. dollar,” he said. “It’s backed by our faith in the government to act in our best interest … and it makes sense if you live in the U.S. or E.U. or China. But if you’re in Venezuela, where the bolivar [currency] is going under extreme hyperinflation and the dollar drops every day, bitcoin makes a lot of sense.”",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-20/venezuela-is-jumping-into-the-crypto-craze,"Why did this happen?

On Tuesday, cybersecurity software firm RedLock reported that hackers had exploited an insecure Kubernetes console, which they used to access and siphon computer processing power from Tesla’s cloud environment in order to mine cryptocurrencies. The team says it discovered and reported the vulnerability to Tesla several months ago.

A Tesla spokesperson told Gizmodo that customer information was not accessed during the incident.

“We maintain a bug bounty program to encourage this type of research, and we addressed this vulnerability within hours of learning about it,” the spokesperson reportedly said, explaining:

“The impact seems to be limited to internally-used engineering test cars only, and our initial investigation found no indication that customer privacy or vehicle safety or security was compromised in any way.”

Unlike previous crypto mining attacks, the hackers that targeted Tesla did not utilize a public mining pool. Instead, they installed mining pool software and obscured it behind CloudFlare, which allowed them to hide the IP address of their mining pool server, making detection of the mining more difficult. To further hide their actions, the hackers ensured that CPU usage remained low during the hack.

RedLock CTO Gaurav Kumar said that public cloud environments are particularly vulnerable to mining hacks, which have been on the rise in tandem with the increase in cryptocurrencies’ value.

“Organizations’ public cloud environments are ideal targets due to the lack of effective cloud threat defense programs,” he explained to Gizmodo. “In the past few months alone, we have uncovered a number of cryptojacking incidents including the one affecting Tesla.”

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch financial services company ING INGA.AS on Tuesday confirmed that Bitfinex, one of the largest exchanges for trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, has a bank account with it in the Netherlands.

Bitfinex’s banking arrangements have been unclear since Wells Fargo severed ties with it last April. In January, Reuters reported that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had sent a subpoena on Dec. 6 to both Bitfinex and sister company Tether for undisclosed reasons.

Bitfinex, whose parent company iFinex is incorporated in the British Virgin Isles and which has offices in Taiwan, could not be reached for comment.

ING spokesman Harold Reusken confirmed in an email that Bitfinex has an account in the Netherlands but would not provide details on the amount held or whether ING also provides banking services for other Bitfinex-related companies.

“With regards to companies that are active in the crypto market, we are very conservative,” Reusken said. He said ING does not itself provide any services to help customers buy or sell cryptocurrencies.

But he said the bank, which is actively experimenting with distributed ledger technology, is willing to serve “companies that are in the value chain of cryptocurrencies.”

SBI Cards Warns Customers of Crypto Risks

SBI Card has issued a warning to customers emphasizing the risks associated with cryptocurrencies. SBI Card also sought to reiterate the position of Reserve Bank of India, stating that government advisories have not given any licensing or authorisation for any entity to operate in any cryptocurrency schemes or virtual currencies.

The announcement comes weeks after Citi India banned the use of its credit and debit cards for the purpose of purchasing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies., at the time issuing a release stating “…Citi India has decided to not permit usage of its credit and debit cards towards purchase or trading of such bitcoins, crypto-currencies, and virtual currencies.”

The notice states “Given concerns, both globally and locally, SBI Card would like to advise you to be mindful of potential economic, financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks associated in dealing with crypto-currencies and virtual currencies.” SBI currently has a customer base of over 5 million, and is the second largest credit card issuer in India behind only HDFC Bank Limited.

Indian Crypto Regulations Expected Soon

Numerous Indian officials have indicated that India’s long-awaited regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrencies are presently being formulated by the relevant institutions, and that the industry can expect said legislation to be implemented soon.

The Chairman of the Department of Economic Affairs, Ajay Tyagi, recently indicated that many aspects of the regulatory apparatus have already been developed, stating “We have actually decided which regulator will do what and the committee should come out with the regulations very quickly.”

The impending regulation has not been welcomed by all members of India’s cryptocurrency authority, with many traders seeking means through which to purchase virtual currencies overseas in an attempt to bypass India’s regulatory jurisdiction.

A proposal was presented at the Russian Expert Council for Non-Bank Credit Organizations to allow rural businesses in the country to receive crypto loans to attract funds from abroad. The chairman of the council, a State Duma member, is asking rural credit cooperatives to study and educate rural residents on cryptocurrency.

Proposal to Allow Crypto-Loans

At the meeting of the Expert Council for Non-Bank Credit Organizations, the chairman of the Council of the National Association of Pawn Shops, Alexei Lazutin, proposed allowing microcredit organizations to issue loans in cryptocurrency.

Citing that “Today there are companies that are starting to issue loans secured by cryptocurrencies,” he was quoted by the Russian Parliamentary newspaper:

If we establish and implement such mechanisms that will allow us to receive crypto-loans from credit institutions, this will help to attract money to the development of the village from abroad, thereby contributing to the development of the Russian economy as a whole.

Rural Credit Coops Asked to Study Crypto

In response to Lazutin’s proposal, the chairman of the aforementioned expert council who is also a member of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, Evgeny Shulepov, said “Rural credit cooperatives need to master blockchain and cryptocurrencies in order to be in the trend,” the Parliamentary newspaper reported.

Rural credit cooperatives in Russia are voluntary, non-profit associations, providing services to preserve the personal savings of members through the issuance of affordable loans. Members are both depositors and creditors. These coops have been successfully established in a number of Russian regions including Volgograd, Rostov, Kaluga, Penza, Leningrad, Perm, Tomsk, Tyumen, Nizhny Novgorod, Yaroslavl regions, and the Republic of Dagestan.

Shulepov was quoted saying, “We will ask the rural credit cooperatives to study what blockchain is and what the general trends in this area are, to think about how to train the villagers in these technologies.” The publication elaborated:

Shulepov suggested that villagers study cryptocurrency.

Currently, Russia has no cryptocurrency regulation. However, the Ministry of Finance has published a draft bill and is working with the central bank and the State Duma on the details of the bill including mining and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

New cryptocurrencies and tokens often rise at a rapid clip, drawing a lot of attention whether they originate in a fork like Litecoin Cash or from an ICO. Yet in many cases, these shiny new coins are no more than a scam: a pump and dump scheme that should be avoided at all cost, as they can cost us the full cost.

Recently we have seen a few cases where suspicions were raised about new cryptocurrencies. They are accused of being coin scams and public arguments have broken out online.

Litecoin Cash and Bitcoin Private controversies

The price of Litecoin Cash (LCC), a hard-form from Litecoin (LTC) has seen its prices jump and has was also grilled by the founder of Litecoin, Charlie Lee. He clarified that any forms may be scams and are not related to Litecoin. He also warned against providing private keys. Is Lee trying to fight back against the competition or are there reasons for concern about LCC?

Bitcoin Private (BTCP), a coin that promotes more private trading, has been accused of being a scam coin by trying to ride on Satoshi's original vision. Is Bitcoin Private just a Bitcoin Scam? BTCP has its proponents that point out to the legitimacy of the coins by noting their wide usage, the people behind them, and more.

There are more cryptocurrencies that are suspected of being crypto-scams. Looking at the broader picture, here are tips that help identify scam coins:

1) Too good to be true

If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. If the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) goes into hyperbole and offers unicorns, it may be the first warning sign. Sure, you can expect a company or a coin to promote itself and focus on its advantages rather than disadvantages. If the promised returns sound outlandish, they probably are. A company making more cautious predictions for the future of its coin and its usage may be more real and down to earth.

Cryptocurrencies do provide opportunities and growth is rapid, but not astronomical. A get rich quick scheme may enrich the sellers, not necessarily the buyers, at least not those at the bottom of the pyramid scheme. You don't want to be the one holding the token when nobody wants to buy it.

Are the innovations and the promises for the commercial use made by Litecoin Cash and Bitcoin Private realistic and down to earth or are they over the top? The answer is in the eye of the beholder as always but the questions should be asked regarding these two coins and any other ones.

2) Is there anybody out there?

It should be easy and intuitive to find who is behind the project. An About page should be easy to find, and a list of founders and team members should appear there, with their pictures. You should easily find the LinkedIn profiles and in case of developers, the GitHub or similar public profiles of the people behind the project.

Is it taking you too much time to find who is behind the project? Are they using only nicknames? Is it hard to find any other information about them? A successful project requires a skilled team that has the necessary expertise and experience. Even if the people behind the project are highly talented but are unwilling to show themselves, this is a warning sign. Successful entrepreneurs and developers take pride in what they do.

The official LCC website includes the photos and the names of most of the development team behind Litecoin Cash, but their public profiles are missing. Is it good enough? Supporters of Bitcoin Private argue that the team offers a high level of transparency. Does it match other projects' level of transparency?

3) No source code

Most serious cryptocurrency projects are open source ones that are made accessible on GitHub. Opening up the source allows transparency and improvement to the code by external contributors, enjoying the collective wisdom. The absence of a link to the source code may indicate that there is something to hide: they do not want others to see what is in the box. Worse off, it may mean there just isn't any source code at all - an even cheaper scam.

The team behind Litecoin Cash promised to publish the source code on Github for all to see.

4) Light or no White Paper

A White Paper is the founding document of a cryptocurrency project and roadmap for the future. A good paper details the internal dynamics and mechanics of a coin. Things may get quite technical in such a paper. If the White Paper is light on technical information, it is already suspicious. If such a document is nowhere to be found, the suspicion grows. It means that the people behind the project did not even make an effort to produce it.

The Bitcoin Private White Paper was easy to look up on Google. Is the document sufficient?

5) Check out the Telegram and Slack channels

Telegram is a popular messaging application that is considered secure and has become popular among the crypto-community. It can be used to communicate around the project and also to sell it to outsiders. You can probe the telegram channel for several things. Are the communications between the people there serious? Are they diving into details? You can get a good impression about the project by examining the flow in the Telegram channel and the Slack channel if it is accessible.

Moreover, Telegram channels are often used to promote the cryptocurrency, promote the ICO or the pre-ICO. As mentioned earlier, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Language full of hyperbole and superlatives, lacking any cautious should raise alerts. A more cautious approach is better.

6) Not listed on many exchanges

The boom in digital coins has led to a boom in crypto exchanges. The coins vary from exchange to exchange and so do the prices. Some digital exchanges have only a very limited set of tradable coins. If the coin you are interested in does not appear on Coinbase, this is not a reason to worry about. Yet if it does not appear anywhere after the ICO has been completed or you see no plans to include it, maybe it is time to worry.

A higher adoption rate by exchanges not only lowers the chances of a scam but also makes liquidity ampler. A crypto project that managed to convince only one exchange to offer it for trading means that buying and selling the coin may be hard.The more exchanges, the better.

Litecoin Cash is currently listed on Yobit, CryptoBridge, TradeSatoshi, MeanXTrade, and MercatoX. How does that compare to the rest? The same check should be done for Bitcoin Private and any new coin you think of getting into.

7) Google the name + the word scam

Searching only for the name of the coin is not enough. Adding the word ""scam"" is already taking one step further. Finding information that includes the name of the currency and the word scam does not immediately mean something is wrong. Perhaps the words appear together as a question in a forum, and the answer may be that it is not a scam. Another false positive may be a competitor trying to bash the coin.

So, do dive into the sites that include these words and check out: are there complaints about the currency there? Are these complaints genuine? Are they common? Do they appear on different sites? If you see too many serious and negative mentions, it may be time to worry. If it is only a random, confused, or angry person, perhaps it si not so bad.

For instance, one of the first results when searching for Bitcoin Private Scam results in a statement that the coin is not a scam after all. Results differ.

8) Use Google Trends for the timespan and related searches

Google Trends is an excellent tool for getting to know what is trending in the world. The service has been upgraded to provide up to date data and also past data and also provides a list of related searches. You can extend the timeframe to the past and see how much time it has been active. A project that is running for a longer period of time means it is more serious, lowering the risk of a ""pump and dump"" scheme. Being new does not mean a project is wrong, but a project with a longer track record is probably less risky.

Another use of Google Trends can be examing the related searches. If these searches are mostly about scams, issues, and suspicions, you are not the only one worrying about the crypto project. You can also use the tool to search for the coin name + scam and see the volume of searches for your preferred cryptocurrency.

A search for Litecoin Cash yields a surge in interest around December but there certainly was some interest in August.

9) Check them out on Google News

The last of the Google-related research tools you can use is Google News. By searching only for news stories about the coin, you will get results from better sources. This is not the full picture you would get in forums, but it is still a more reliable one. Negative mentions by serious outlets may be a warning sign as well.

10) Check the link

If you see promotional material about an ICO that includes a link to participate in that sale, examine the link. It can be done by hovering above the link or right-clicking on the browser and selecting View Source to see how the link is structured.

If the link includes a querystring at the end of it that looks like ""?referrer=123456"" or ""&landing=654321"" this implies that the site promoting the ICO is getting paid for the referral. This is a legitimate practice and does not automatically imply any wrongdoing, but it does mean that you should take the positive language with a grain of salt. It may not be the most objective review and perhaps you would want to examine other opinions.

Conclusion - Research is Essential

With the explosion of cryptocurrencies, there has also been an unwelcome rise in crypto scams or scam coins. An in-depth research is needed to assess new coins, like with any other investment.

In fact, a few schools even accept bitcoin for tuition. King's College in New York became the first U.S. institution to allow bitcoin tuition payments in 2014. Since then, a number of other international schools have followed.

A bitcoin is digital currency exchanged independent of banks or governments; this currency can be converted into cash when deposited into accounts at prices set in online trading. Last December, the value of bitcoin reached nearly $20,000 – that's about $2,000 more than the typical cost of attendance for a full-time student at a community college in 2017-2018.

Although the values of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have plummeted since then, interest in these currencies remains high – especially among college students.

While a direct transaction may help from a tax standpoint, students can use these types of digital currencies to pay for college costs even if their school doesn't accept this type of money for payment.

For instance, you could easily invest in these currencies and cash out when the tuition bill arrives. Schools somewhat expect this by counting most investments in your expected family contribution.

But is this a smart tactic? The Student Loan Ranger can't comment on whether to invest in cryptocurrencies, and we suggest finding online resources to learn more. But here are a few pros and cons for borrowing student loans versus investing and cashing out cryptocurrency. These can apply to most non-college savings investments too.

Return on Investment

Once they have student loans, many borrowers wonder whether to pay down their debt or invest in the future. This is an important balancing act, especially when it comes to saving for retirement.

The key consideration is the return after taxes.

For a student loan with a fixed interest rate, the return is clear; this can be a positive to using loans. For instance, let's say you leave school owing around $37,000 in student loans. At a 6.8 percent fixed interest rate, repaying those loans over five years instead of 10 would drop the total interest you pay from $14,096 to $6,749. Those savings are concrete, and you can calculate them before you borrow anything.

These numbers become murkier for investments, which involve risk. Your investment may gain value, but it's also possible to lose some or all of what you invest, especially with something as volatile as cryptocurrency.

The price of bitcoin, for instance, has fluctuated over the past year. As of this post, the price is significantly less than the high-water mark of nearly $20,000. Bitcoin was as low as $7,362 earlier this month, according to the digital currency exchange Coinbase.

Let's say you diverted money from student loan payments or a traditional college savings account toward bitcoin at the height of its value. Just two months later, you would have lost more than 60 percent of the money – and you would still have student loan or tuition bills to pay.

Selling Low

That kind of loss is scary, but the rapid gains of bitcoin may make the risk worthwhile for some. As debt totals continue to rise annually, anything that helps students mitigate their borrowing is worth investigating.

Learn about using an IRA to pay for college tuition. ]

Consider the low value for bitcoin from earlier in February. Yes, it was down around 60 percent from the all-time high. But it was still seven times more than the bitcoin price in February 2017.

Some experts believe bitcoin's value could reach $60,000 this year. If that happens – and remember it's a big if – reaping those gains would offer students and their families a much better funding option than student loans. Essentially, it would be $50,000 in extra money for college after taxes.

At least one New York University student has already taken advantage of the price spike to cover tuition. On the other hand, this unprecedented volatility means you could cash out too early, such as the person who bought two pizzas in 2010 for 10,000 bitcoins. Today that would be worth more than $100 million.",2018-02-21,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/cryptocurrency-exchanges-look-to-speed-up-bitcoin-transactions.html,"The Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange application seen on the screen of an iPhone.

Two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges are aiming to make bitcoin transactions faster and cheaper with a new software update announced this week.

Both Coinbase and Bitfinex said they are adopting a software called SegWit, which bitcoin bulls and one exchange say should lower fees by as much as 20 percent while speeding up transactions.

""The most noticeable changes in the short term should be more efficiency when transacting,"" said Alex Sunnarborg, founding partner at crypto hedge fund Tetras Capital. ""SegWit adoption is undoubtedly positive for bitcoin as it greatly impacts transaction fees, speed, and future tech possibilities, all areas in which alternative crypto assets like Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum compete with and often criticize bitcoin on.""

Bitcoin enthusiasts have split over the best way to improve the cryptocurrency network's efficiency. An upgrade called SegWit2x was called off in the fall after it lost widespread support.

Meanwhile, bitcoin transaction fees soared well above $20 in the last few months and confirmation times could take longer than a day. Some users were so frustrated with fees, and unable to compromise on blockchain size increases, that they ""forked"" bitcoin, and created bitcoin cash this summer.

The software Segregated Witness, or SegWit, slightly increases the block size. As the number of transactions that fit into each block goes up, transactions get faster. SegWit went live in August as Bitcoin's skyrocketing popularity led to some slowdowns on the network.

Bitfinex, which facilitates about 38 percent of all U.S. dollar-bitcoin trading volume according to CryptoCompare, announced the software roll-out on Tuesday.

""We are delighted that through this implementation we can provide our customers with bitcoin withdrawal fees that are up to 20 percent lower, as well as faster-than-ever transaction speeds,"" Bitfinex Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino said in a statement.

San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase, which does 17 percent of all U.S. dollar bitcoin trading volume according to CryptoCompare, also tweeted the software update this week. The first phase will kick off this week, and should be fully available by the middle of next week, the company tweeted Tuesday.

Bitcoin prices shrugged off the news, and fell 7 percent Wednesday, trading near $10,500. The cryptocurrency is down more than 40 percent year to date. Ethereum dropped more than 4 percent, trading near $832, and is down 37 percent year to date.

The software news could mean more for long-term sentiment than short-term prices, said Brian Kelly, CNBC contributor and CEO of BKCM.

""It's very good for the ecosystem,"" Kelly said. ""We're making progress on the technology front, that takes the criticism that fees are too high out of picture.""

Ethereum bull Benjamin Roberts agreed that the software update is a positive long-term sign for bitcoin, adding that more people may be open to the cryptocurrency if transaction fees fell. But it still remains to be seen if the update alone is ""enough,"" he said.

""It's an incremental improvement,"" said Roberts, founder and CEO of Citizen Hex. ""It's good that different players are adopting the changes but it's a very small step on the way to what needs to be a significant improvement.""",2018-02-21,https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-hit-hackers-used-systems-mine-cryptocurrency/,"Tesla Hit by Hackers Who Used its Systems to Mine Cryptocurrency

Tesla Cloud Mining

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), the electric car manufacturer based in Palo Alto, California, is the latest corporation to fall victim to ‘cryptojacking’, according to newly released research from cyber security firm RedLock.

The researchers’ CSI team found that hackers had infiltrated Tesla’s Kubernetes console (a system for containerized apps that was originally designed by Google) which was not password protected. Within one pod, access credentials were exposed to Tesla’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) environment which contained an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket that had sensitive data such as telemetry. In addition to the data exposure, the hackers were mining for cryptocurrency from within one of Tesla’s Kubernetes pods.

The CSI team noted some sophisticated evasion measures that were employed in this attack. Unlike other crypto mining incidents, the hackers did not use a well known public mining pool in this attack. Instead, they installed mining pool software and configured the malicious script to connect to an unlisted or semi-public endpoint. This makes it difficult for standard IP/domain-based threat intelligence feeds to detect the malicious activity, they explain.

Don’t Panic

According to the research, the Tesla hackers also hid the true IP address of the mining pool server behind Cloudflare, a free content delivery network (CDN) service. The hackers can use a new IP address on-demand by registering for free CDN services. This makes IP address-based detection of crypto mining activity even more challenging.

Moreover, the mining software was configured to listen on a non-standard port which makes it hard to detect the activity based on port traffic. Lastly, the CSI team also observed on Tesla’s Kubernetes dashboard that CPU usage was not very high. The hackers had most likely configured the mining software to keep the usage low to evade detection, they explain.

Fortunately, Musk need not worry about his computing resources being diverted to crypto mining anymore. The RedLock CSI team immediately reported the incident to Tesla and the issue was quickly rectified they say.

The Zaif exchange, operated by Osaka-based Tech Bureau Corp., saw the brief glitch last week which enabled traders to make crypto purchases for free, according to Reuters.

As customers realized the situation, a number attempted to make the most of the 20-minute window for free coins. One, according to the Asahi Shimbun, even placed a order for bitcoin worth 2,200 trillion yen ($20 trillion) at the time; then moving to quickly sell it again.

Tech Bureau Corp. announced yesterday that the incident had occurred on Feb. 16, detailing that seven customers had obtained cryptocurrencies at zero cost.

The firm later cancelled the transactions and corrected the users’ balances, Asahi indicates. However, a Reuters source suggests that the correction is still being negotiated with one of the seven users who attempted to transfer the free bitcoin away from the Zaif platform.

At least one customer attempted to resell their bitcoin, according to Asahi, but the large amount of cryptocurrency offered soon drew attention, even outside the exchange.

A Tech Bureau official reportedly apologized for the glitch and said the company would take measures to prevent such problems from reoccurring.

The news comes when Japan’s exchanges are already under pressure over technical standards after the Coincheck exchange suffered a major hack in January. The country’s finance watchdog, the Financial Services Agency, was asked by the government to make inspections at a number of unlicensed exchanges on Feb. 16 to ensure their levels of security are up to par.

And yesterday, a news report suggested a group of cryptocurrency exchanges is teaming up to form a new self-regulatory body in the wake of the Coincheck breach.

June 22, 2014. Jackson Palmer, a self-identified ""average geek,"" is high in the stands at a Nascar race at Sonoma Raceway, California. He is an Australian man in his 20s. He has zero interest in racing. Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine it would come to this.

He surveys the scene.

Below him: a tremendous crowd. The overwhelming blare of engines. Hurtling round at tremendous speeds: the #98 Moonrocket, a high-performance racing car. No different from the other cars on the track, except for one crucial detail.

On the bonnet of the car: a dog. A Shiba Inu, more commonly known as a ""Shibe,"" the dog made famous in the Doge meme that was popular in 2013.

Emblazoned on top: the word ""DOGECOIN"" in all caps. Below: ""digital currency"".

Palmer describes the situation using words like ""crazy,"" ""surreal"" and ""nuts."" He remembers this moment as a ""reality check."" Dogecoin was a tweet, then it was a cryptocurrency worth money in the real world. Six months later, he watched as a joke that he'd made in passing somehow manifested itself into something tangible. A Dogecar in full flight.

It reminded Palmer how insane the world could be.

This is the story of Dogecoin, the joke that became too real for its own good.

The next big thing

Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin, enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network. One important difference: bitcoin is the original blockchain proof-of-concept. Bitcoin is ground-breaking. Bitcoin is (some believe) world-changing tech with the potential to transform how money works in the 21st century.

Dogecoin is a digital coin with a picture of dog on it.

""It is a puzzle to me why Dogecoin is so highly valued,"" says Adrian Lee, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Technology in Sydney.

At one point Dogecoin was worth $2 billion. It's difficult to make sense of that.

""Dogecoin is an easily replicable coin,"" Lee said. ""I don't know how it distinguishes itself from Bitcoin. I really think it has to do with being established early.



""And also the dog.""

If you've spent any time on the internet during the last decade, you've probably heard of the Doge meme. The iconic Shibe, his inner monologue expressed in comic sans with broken modifiers: ""so scare,"" ""much noble,"" ""wow.""

Now playing: Watch this: Dogecoin explained: The joke cryptocurrency worth serious...

At the peak of the meme's popularity near the tail end of 2013, Palmer, an Australian marketer for one of the world's largest tech companies, made a joke combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. It was a joke taking aim at the bizarre world of crypto and bitcoin's multiple derivatives.

""Investing in Dogecoin,"" Palmer tweeted, ""pretty sure it's the next big thing.""

The tweet got a lot of attention.

For laughs, Palmer decided to keep the joke going. He bought the Dogecoin.com domain and uploaded a photoshopped Shibe on a coin.

He left a note on the site: If you want to make Dogecoin a reality, get in touch.

Nintendo

The bell tolls



On the other side of the world, Billy Markus, a video game-obsessed software engineer at IBM, saw Palmer's note. He'd just finished ""Bells"", a project he was working on in his spare time.

Bells was a cryptocurrency named after money used in the Nintendo game Animal Crossing. It was 2013, the original crypto gold rush. Markus saw that bitcoin's code was open-source. He decided to take a weekend and do something weird. He tried to create his own cryptocurrency for ""sillies,"" as he put it.

Bells was weird as hell. The major difference between Bells and regular cryptocurrencies was the rewards: they were completely random. If you mined bitcoin, using a decently powerful home computer, the rewards were consistent.

If you mined Bells, there was no telling whether the reward would be one Bell or 500 Bells.

And that's because Bells wasn't meant to be serious, it was a digital currency based on a video game about animals who live in a village and go fishing together.

The cryptocurrency community didn't really get the joke.

""People were just trashing it,"" laughs Markus, who quickly discovered there was very little crossover between crypto-obsessives and gamers.

""I was like alright, I retire,"" says Markus. ""I don't need to do this anymore.""

But then Markus read Palmer's message on Dogecoin.com. That was the moment Billy Markus decided to come out of crypto retirement.

Ctrl+F bitcoin



When Palmer didn't immediately respond to Markus' offer to help build Dogecoin, he started working on it anyway.

""Dogecoin,"" says Markus, ""from 'that seems like it's funny' to actually doing it, took about three hours. It's almost trivial to create a new cryptocurrency.""

It was a find-and-replace job.

Ctrl+F 'Bitcoin,' replace with 'Dogecoin.'

Markus freely admits to finding large chunks of bitcoin's source code completely incomprehensible, but knew enough to change a few core elements for Dogecoin. For example, Markus created 100 billion dogecoins (as opposed to bitcoin's 21 million) and made them easier to mine. (Dogecoin is already close to being mined out, while bitcoin's final coin will be mined in 2140.)

He changed the font (to comic sans of course) and changed every mention of the word 'mine' to 'dig' (because dogs don't mine, they dig...).

And then, during his lunch break, Markus set Dogecoin live.

Moving at light speed

Premining: the act of gathering cryptocurrency before launching your coin into the public domain. Almost everyone serious about launching a cryptocurrency does this.

But Markus and Palmer didn't premine any Dogecoin. Because they weren't serious about launching a cryptocurrency.

""We thought it was this big joke that would die off,"" laughs Palmer.

And according to Markus, Palmer wasn't even sure how to mine a cryptocurrency.

Markus had a relatively powerful gaming PC, with two graphics cards, so he was officially the first person to mine Dogecoin. But given the the nature of mining (which gets increasingly difficult as the currency is mined) Billy's computer was no longer powerful enough to mine Dogecoin after about five minutes. Markus split what he'd mined 50-50 with Palmer and that was that. Both got about $5,000 of Dogecoin.

And that's all the Dogecoin either man would ever own.

In online crypto circles, Dogecoin became popular very quickly. Forum threads moved rapidly. The name Dogecoin echoed throughout dark corners of the internet.

But Reddit was almost certainly the main driver in Dogecoin's rapid rise to crypto stardom. The Dogecoin subreddit exploded almost immediately, and with that explosion came the infrastructure any cryptocurrency needs if it is to become successful: mining pools, services.

Now playing: Watch this: What the heck is blockchain?

""It was moving at light speed,"" explains Markus. ""Within minutes we were like, 'Wow, this is way out of our control.""

But it was the Reddit ""tipping bot"" that drove Dogecoin into the stratosphere.

If a user posted something to the effect of, ""hey 'dogebot' tip this person five dogecoin,"" that Reddit user would automatically receive five Dogecoin. People were sending Dogecoin back and forth in a feel-good exercise that cost very little money in real-world terms.

""I liked it,"" says Markus. ""At the time, Dogecoin wasn't worth anything, but getting five Dogecoin felt better than getting two cents.""

Reddit users were sharing Dogecoin back and forth constantly, which expanded the user base of Dogecoin and, as a result, increased its value as a cryptocurrency.

""Pretty much everyone who used Reddit had Dogecoin,"" says Palmer. ""I think that was key to its success.""

A force for good



January 2014. Jackson Palmer is already three drinks deep at a trivia night at his local pub in Sydney. His phone starts buzzing. It doesn't stop buzzing.

Earlier that night, Palmer and the Dogecoin community had brainstormed a ridiculous (but completely brilliant) idea.

For the first time in a decade, Jamaica's bobsled team had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but it didn't have enough money to attend. As huge fans of the comedy ""Cool Runnings,"" Palmer and the Dogecoin crew decided to do something about it.

They chucked up a Dogecoin address onto the subreddit and asked for donations. Hours later they'd raised $25,000.

That's when Palmer's phone started vibrating off the hook.

""I was like, 'Quick we need to get back to our computers,'"" laughs Palmer.

So Palmer and friends stumbled home from the pub, picked up a six-pack of beer for good measure and set about figuring out how to send 26 million Dogecoins to the Jamaican bobsled team.

It was a gesture that symbolized the early spirit of Dogecoin.

In Markus' words, they were allergic to the word ""invest."" Both Palmer and Markus donated all their Dogecoin to these massive charity initiatives. They helped build water wells in Kenya and raised money to help train assistance dogs for autistic children.

""We wanted to create something that was a force for good,"" explains Palmer.

But as the community grew, the initial spirit in which Dogecoin was launched was difficult to preserve. People started to care about the price of Dogecoin. They were literally and figuratively invested in it.

And that terrified Markus.

""I don't mind if someone spends ten bucks and gets some Dogecoin,"" says Markus. ""It's like buying a movie ticket or something, that's fun.



""But when someone puts $20,000 in? That makes me really, really uncomfortable.""

Markus began clashing with members of the community. For him, Dogecoin was still crypto ""for sillies,"" but here it was ballooning into a currency people were trading for real money. In his view Dogecoin was a silly thing that should remain silly. Many in the community disagreed.

Eventually he decided enough was enough.

""I was like, ""Okay, this is dumb. I don't want to be the leader of a cult.""""

Markus decided to bail on Dogecoin.

Moolah

It was Moolah that pushed Dogecoin to the brink.

Palmer describes it as ""PayPal for cryptocurrency."" From the very beginning, Palmer was cynical.

Run by a British man calling himself Alex Green, Moolah was a cryptocurrency exchange designed to help people buy and sell Dogecoin. They infiltrated the Dogecoin community with startling efficiency.

Alex Green began by doling out Dogecoin in exchange for upvotes on the Dogecoin subreddit. He also donated generously to charitable causes the community were involved in, like $2,500 to a cancer charity, or $3,000 to help get the Dogecoin Nascar vehicle on the track.

The community loved it. Soon Moolah began hiring people from the Dogecoin community for key positions in the company.



""Alex Green started building his business on top of Dogecoin,"" says Palmer.

Markus, watching from afar, wasn't a fan.

Now playing: Watch this: Cryptojacking: The hot new hacker trick for easy money

Despite removing himself from the day-to-day workings of Dogecoin, Markus attended a Dogecoin convention, organized in part by Palmer. He wanted to catch up with some of the old gang. By chance, he ran into representatives from Moolah, who were at the bar guzzling Cristal at $200 a bottle. They poured a glass for Markus.

""I was really uncomfortable,"" remembers Markus. ""I said, 'whatever's going on here I just don't want any part of it.'""

""I just passed the glass to someone else.""

Many key figures in the Dogecoin community shared Markus' suspicions, particularly Palmer, who was wary of Moolah from the beginning. But when concerns were raised they were mostly shouted down by a community that enjoyed the free currency being sent their way.

Later Moolah began soliciting the Dogecoin community for investment dollars and plenty donated Dogecoin to the cause. Why not? Moolah had been generous in the past. It made sense to repay the favor.

Moolah received over $300,000 from the Dogecoin community, across three separate rounds of investment.

And then it all came crashing down.

Months later, October 2014, Moolah went completely bankrupt. The Dogecoin community would end up losing every single cent they'd invested.

The situation got worse. An ex-girlfriend of Green got in contact with Palmer and other members of the Dogecoin community. She revealed that Green was actually Ryan Kennedy, who was notorious in the UK anime community for running companies terrifyingly similar to Moolah.

Suddenly the UK police were involved. After a three-year investigation, Kennedy faces multiple charges of fraud and money laundering. At a preliminary hearing in Bristol Crown Court on September 2017 he denied all charges. A request for comment was sent to Kennedy's Defence Lawyer, but we've yet to receive a response.

His trial is scheduled for September 2018.

But Kennedy had to answer to more serious, disturbing crimes. In May 2016, he was tried and convicted on three counts of rape with three separate women. According to press reports he smiled as he was being led from court.

""Ryan Kennedy convinced his victims they had no choice but to do as they were told,"" said senior prosecutor Ben Samples. ""He was emotionally, sexually and physically abusive, putting his needs above all else.""

Ryan Kennedy is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a UK prison.

Remember this moment

In the months after Moolah's bankruptcy, Palmer struggled. He distanced himself from Dogecoin. From the community. From cryptocurrency as a whole.

""The energy I was putting into it wasn't helping me from a mental health perspective,"" he explains.

Dogecoin

Like Markus, Palmer decided to bail on Dogecoin.

Palmer has re-emerged on the cryptocurrency scene. He now runs his own YouTube channel. He has no interest in launching another cryptocurrency and has little to do with Dogecoin. He calls himself a crypto skeptic. ""Cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem,"" he says.

What problem did Dogecoin solve?

""I don't think it solves anything,"" he says. ""If anything, it exists as an educational tool. It's a reminder that we can't take this stuff seriously.

""I hope people see Dogecoin and say, I'm not going to put all my money into this. Because right now there's a dog on a coin and it's worth half a billion dollars.""

Outside of the occasional donation, neither Palmer or Markus owns any significant amount of Dogecoin.

Back in January 2014, Markus posted a message on the Dogecoin subreddit; an ode to the community and what it had achieved. One year later, in the wake of the Moolah disaster, it had been reposted. An attempt to recapture the spirit in which Dogecoin had been founded.

It was a timely reminder of what had been lost.

""I have no way of knowing how transient this all may be,"" Markus wrote of Dogecoin, two months after creating it.

He wrote about how proud he was -- of the community, of the money they'd raised for various good causes. He thanked everyone for the incredible amount of work they'd put in.

""I would like everyone to remember this moment,"" he said. ""My hope is that Dogecoin will always be remembered fondly.""

Rebooting the Reef: CNET dives deep into how tech can help save Australia's Great Barrier Reef.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/how-to-know-whether-you-owe-taxes-on-bitcoin.html,"In 2017, bitcoin went from trading at below $1,000 early in the year to a peak of over $19,000 in December, while other virtual currencies also enjoyed gains. For anyone who ignored the common crypto-slang advice to ""HODL,"" to hold on to your investment for dear life, and decided to cash out, those profits are considered income by the IRS. If you sold crypto-coins or used crypto to buy anything in 2017, you probably owe the IRS taxes, says Ryan Losi, a certified public accountant and the executive vice president of Virginia accounting firm PIASCIK. ""For Americans there is no free lunch,"" Losi says. ""If you're richer tomorrow than you were today, it is likely you have some tax burden associated with that."" And not paying up can have consequences. If the IRS discovers you under-reported your income when you file your taxes in April, ""there is a failure-to-pay penalty of 0.5 percent per month, starting after the month in which it was due,"" Losi explains. ""Then there is a failure-to-pay penalty of 5 percent on top of that."" Then, there's interest. To avoid penalties, here's what you need to know about paying taxes on bitcoin.

1. Crypto is on the IRS's radar

While the number of people who own virtual currencies isn't certain, leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase had an estimated 11.7 million users at the end of October 2017, according to data compiled by Alistair Milne, co-founder and chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund. (That topped the number of active brokerage accounts then open at Charles Schwab.) But unlike with traditional investments, in which case you're likely to be issued a 1099 form (which is also sent to the IRS) to keep track of your holdings and tax obligations, that isn't necessarily the case with virtual currency. Coinbase will provide 1099 forms to ""certain business customers"" and ""customers that have received at least $20,000 cash for sales of virtual currency related to at least 200 transactions in a calendar year,"" according to the company's customer support page. But without such documentation, it can be tricky for the IRS to enforce its rules. ""[For] now it is difficult for the IRS to really find out on an individual basis whether you reported your virtual currency sales or exchanges,"" Losi says. Indeed, it appears barely anyone is paying taxes on their crypto-gains. For example, in 2015, only 802 Coinbase users told the IRS about bitcoin gains, despite the exchange having 2.9 million users in December of that year, according to Milne's data. Recently however, the IRS has taken steps to identify tax-payers who are profiting, but not reporting. In 2016, the IRS summoned records from Coinbase, and a court ruled the company had to disclose information on about 14,000 users who have ""either bought, sold, sent or received at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin in a given year,"" CNBC reports. Even if you aren't a hefty Coinbase user, you're obligated to report, and every U.S. taxpayer can potentially be audited by the IRS. The IRS examined 0.6 percent of the 193 million tax returns filed in fiscal year 2016, or about 1.2 million.

2. You owe taxes if you sold or spent crypto

In 2014, the IRS first issued official guidance on how to treat virtual currencies, which outlined that they are considered property. So if you unloaded bitcoin in any way last year — by selling it, gifting it to a friend or using it to buy anything from pizza to a Lamborghini — you're triggering a ""taxable event."" And you're then responsible for paying taxes on the appreciation of the virtual currency from the price at which you bought it, to the price at which you sold (or spent) it. For example, if you paid for a house using bitcoin, whatever your actual methods, the IRS thinks of it this way: You sold bitcoin for cash and used cash to buy a home. So, you're obligated to pay taxes on how much the bitcoin appreciated from the time you invested up until the time you shelled out for the house. That gain can be taxed at different rates. If you held a virtual currency for over a year before selling or paying for something with it, you pay a capital gains tax, which can range from 0 percent to 20 percent. Use Form 8949 to report it. If you held for less than a year, you pay ordinary income tax.

3. You don't owe taxes if you bought and held

If you just bought and held last year, then you don't owe taxes on the asset's appreciation because there was no ""taxable event."" Like with stocks, bonds or any other investment on which you might pay capital gains, you only have to pay after you sell or exchange virtual currency. If you just bought and held, ""there is no triggering of gain that you would recognize on a 2017 tax return,"" Losi says.

4. It's smart to keep your own records

If you're transacting with crypto-coins frequently, you'll want to keep diligent notes on the prices at which you buy and cash out. ""You really, really need to have documentation down,"" Losi says. ""If you can not prove your [cost] basis,"" he explains, referring to the price at which you purchased, ""guess how much is taxable? Not the gain, the gross proceeds."" Here's an example to demonstrate: If you bought a cryptocurrency at $5 and sold it for $10, you should only be taxed on the gain, the $5 increase. But if you don't have proof that you bought at $5, you're taxed on the amount you sold it for, the $10 total. To keep track of all of your transactions, Tyson Cross, a tax attorney in Reno, Nevada recommends to CNBC that you frequently download reports of your transaction histories from whatever exchanges you use and keep them for your files. Coinbase users can generate a ""Cost Basis for Taxes"" report online.

5. Taking losses",2018-02-20,https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2018/02/21/rich-can-get-richer-off-cryptocurrencies/,"I’m guilty.

I’m guilty for making fun of people betting obscene amounts of money on cryptocurrency because I know I’m safe. I’ve personally only put in money that I can afford to lose. When I see someone put $25,000 on Bitcoin, I laugh, but I also feel bad. When I see a forum of people potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars, I’ve posted it and everyone’s had a good chuckle.

But deep down there’s something really sad, really painful happening. It’s a global phenomena where people are able to (very, very quickly) be part of a financial movement that in the past has rewarded people with triple-digit percent returns, one that doesn’t require you to understand a complex stock market, but simply see that a coin is worth $X and predict — somehow, and it seemed likely at one point it would — become $Y, a higher number.

As I write this, anyone who invested close to Bitcoin’s peak and didn’t sell soon after — fearing that they’d miss out on an almost certain rise to $50,000 a coin — has almost certainly seen his/her investment disappear.

I finally decided to write this piece — after it had languished in drafts for about a month — because of the launch of Litecoin Cash which I brought up in my latest cryptocurrency newsletter.

To quote myself:

If anything cryptocurrency has truly become the libertarian nightmare — you can truly take over a new cryptocurrency if you have expensive mining hardware, or have the funds to buy in early (or, indeed, get free coins from forking).

It’s not even 24 hours into Litecoin Cash mining, and already several huge pools exist to specifically not “allow legacy SHA256 hardware” to mine a brand new currency — they want to conquer it, to mine it.

To quote a few random people in Discord, “the difficulty went from 275263.6924763158 to 891531.7069405196, in 10 minutes, wtf,” and Tanner, one of the core Litecoin Cash founders, said “The hashpower is worryingly concentrated right now.”

Even getting Litecoin Cash from the fork was predominantly rewarding those with deep pockets (i.e. those who could afford a lot of Litecoin could claim 10 Litecoin Cash for every LTC they had) or with mining hardware. Just so we’re clear, a “cheap” SHA256 (used to mine Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) unit is still thousands of dollars and sounds like a miniature jet engine, costs tons of money in power and still costs thousands.

The big lie

People seem to think that cryptocurrency is some sort of equalizer, a massive redistribution of income that is somehow good for the world at large. However, for at least a year, it’s become exactly the opposite — it’s another way for the already-rich to become richer.

The argument against this is that inherently “anyone can get in on any new coin” — that you could theoretically look at GruntCoin and invest $500 in it and it could become a bazillion dollars. Questionably responsible articles like this one from New York Magazine suggest that someone can simply “walk into” this industry and make $80,000 overnight — masking the fact that this person says the following:

Verge [an altcoin] is just 1 of 100 trades I’ve made since opening my day-trading account with three bitcoins…

So even when Bitcoin was at its cheapest in a long time, this guy still had $12,000 to exchange, and all of the faux-anxiety laced in this piece falls flat when you realize that he started with what is an incredible amount for most people. Worse still, he talks about a time that one random coin investment went to $80,000. This is a thing called “luck” not “investment strategy.”

Cryptocurrency is gambling masked as investment for 99 percent of people. The argument for ease of access is the same as a casino, except slightly safer and much slower. Take $100, put it on a number and hope that number hits. Yes, you can pull your funds and there are few 3’s or 7’s that can truly roll to wipe out your investment, but if you bought at the wrong time, guess what? It’s probably destroyed your investment.

If you have the cash, you can theoretically pick up and hold currencies in the hopes they go up, except there’s the important detail that you’re probably not gonna get rich off of it anymore without being rich in the first place. You’re not getting rich off of Ethereum or Bitcoin unless you have the capital to buy an absolute shit-ton, or able to buy enough mining rigs to fight off the increase in difficulty that years of other people mining it has created.

You’re not gonna get rich off an ICO, as they’re becoming increasingly gated and requiring six-figure investments. Public sales of valuable coins barely happen anymore. You can’t read the tea-leaves, you can’t see the future. Though a year ago I suppose you could have made a lot of money, you still needed to put up at least $1000 — which isn’t a reasonable amount for most people. Furthermore, most people would have (fairly) classified it as a stupid investment.

We’ve enjoyed rags to riches stories since the junk bond trading frenzy happened in the ’80s — we love the idea that anyone can walk in and just get that paper. The horrible truth is that while there may be more access to the supply of cryptocurrencies, there most definitely isn’t the income equality that would mean that “anyone” can get rich.

Quite the opposite.

‘Commodities King’ Dennis Gartman has been left with a red face and diminished pension fund after investing in a dubious blockchain company. Shares in Riot Blockchain Inc plunged by 30% following a CNBC investigation, leaving Gartman’s fund in a negative balance for the year to date. The trader has previously described bitcoin as being “nothing more than a scam of the first order.”

Gartman Gets Rekt by the Blockchain Meme

There was more than a touch of schadenfreude in the crypto community when news of Dennis Gartman’s poor investment emerged this week. Every trader is bound to get things wrong on occasions, but in going long on Riot Blockchain Inc, Gartman appears to have gone against his own advice. By his own admission, the author of the eponymous The Gartman Letter doesn’t fully understand bitcoin. His decision to invest heavily in a company purporting to make use of bitcoin’s underlying ledger technology is thus a strange one.

Dennis Gartman has been involved in the markets since the 1970s, and by all accounts has done well for himself. In 1987 he began producing The Gartman Letter, which goes out to leading banks, brokerages, mutual funds, and hedge funds on a full-time basis. On Tuesday he was forced to deliver bad news to the letter’s subscribers:

Friday was one of the worst days we have suffered through in a very long while. We were long of a sizeable position in a blockchain focused company that was the victim of a CNBC expose, which sent the shares down more than 20 percent and which sent us ‘down’ for the year to date, having been up about 6 percent previously.

In October the company, then trading as Bioptix, changed its name to Riot Blockchain. By December 19 its share price had shot up to $38.60 from around $5 in October. It couldn’t sustain that momentum however and has been dropping ever since. A CNBC investigation into the firm last week shaved 33% off its stock in a single day, which is now trading for under $11. The CNBC article quotes SEC chairman Jay Clayton as saying: “Nobody should think it is OK to change your name to something that involves blockchain when you have no real underlying blockchain business plan and try to sell securities based on the hype around blockchain.”

Believe the Blockchain But Don’t Believe the Blockchain Hype

As Bioptix, the company had been known for filing veterinary patents, which makes its reinvention as blockchain innovator all the harder to fathom. One might have suspected an investor of Mr Gartman’s stature to have exercised more caution and diligence. “Lessons have to be learned again and again and again it seems,” finished Gartman glumly, “Or at least we apparently have to learn them over and over and over again.” Two months ago, the same Commodities King was telling CNBC that bitcoin was nonsense. As he is now learning, bitcoin is perfectly sensible. Investing in companies that have requisitioned the blockchain mantle, however, is anything but.

Do you think Mr Gartman will be dissuaded from investing in blockchain companies from now on? Let us know in the comments section below.

Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham published his second “Crypto Quarterly” report this week, and he explained that the question of regulation is one of “when” and not “if.” Still, he remains optimistic about the stance of U.S. regulators when it comes to crypto-assets. Some of the regulatory overhang in the U.S. was removed in December, and he was further encouraged by the commentary offered by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton and CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo earlier this month.

Graham noted that the key regulators said that some cryptocurrencies “do not appear to be securities,” and he felt that their comments seem “foundationally supportive of Reg D / SAFT offerings. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at two key areas of regulation enforcement on crypt-assets.

The first is fraudulent initial coin offerings, which Graham describes as those in which “little or no actual work has been done to fulfill the ‘promise’ of the relevant token network.” He believes that “at least a few hundred” of the roughly 1,500 ICOs could be in that category. He also said that he’s particularly concerned about “non-utility” or “pre-functional” tokens being sold to investors directly and warned that “a significant majority of those sold in ICOs could be in this category.”

After a “long process of disgorgement and penalties,” Graham expects “only a small handful of tokens” to remains as “viable,” yet “very speculative” investments. He expects U.S. regulators to finally crack down on ICOs in the spring or summer and believes that 90% of the tokens with a more-than $100 million market value could disappear or at least see their valuations tumble, bringing the total from about 200 down to about 20. His main concern lies with altcoins and newer cryptocurrencies.

He thinks it is more difficult to predict what might happen to bitcoin, ethereum, other large-cap crypto-assets, and even “some of the legitimate small-cap ones.” He noted that crypto bulls might seek out the remaining tokens, inflating their prices and triggering a massive bull market. However, he thinks it is more likely that investors will be scared away from cryptocurrencies for a time.

For now, he expects the bitcoin price volatility to continue, describing it as similar to flying a plane or parenting, with “hours of boredom punctuated by moments of terror.” He noted that the bitcoin price tends to trade sideways for a while before some major catalyst thrusts it suddenly higher or plunges it much lower.

So what does the bitcoin market need to iron out some of the volatility? Graham suggests there’s just one thing, drawing from commentary from “crypto-finance luminary” Chris Burniske, who feels that every crypto-assets valuation can be described by MV = PQ, or market (“size of the asset base”) times the “velocity of the asset” = price times quantity.

In Graham’s view, the crypto-asset market lacks demand, denoted by “Q” in Burniske’s formula. This is interesting in light of all the attention bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been receiving in the financial press these days. One would think that there’s plenty of demand, at least for bitcoin and the other well-known tokens, based on the price and volatility.

However, Graham explained why he sees a lack of demand: “Within the well-known blockchain networks, very little file storage capacity is being demanded, very little specialized currency is being used for cross-border payments and so on.”

Other than bitcoin, the Canaccord Genuity analyst describes the cryptocurrency market as “the equivalent of hundreds of stocks trading at significant market values without any revenue.” The use of market capitalization to measure the amount of each cryptocurrency in circulation certainly highlights how the financial industry is drawing comparisons between crypto-assets and stocks without making it apparent that this is what’s happening.

Graham warned that this sort of behavior will make it difficult for altcoins to survive as regulators start cracking down.",2018-02-21 18:26:12+00:00

جمهوری اسلامی ایران‎ The Islamic Republic of Iran has apparently changed course on cryptocurrency, or perhaps it has clarified its real position previously mischaracterized by the press. It’s increasingly difficult to get a real handle on the official status of crypto in the Persian homeland.

Iran to Control and Prevent Cryptocurrency

Hamed Jafari reported as soon as two weeks ago, Iran was considering issuing “a local cryptocurrency, a cryptocurrency consortium with specific countries and regulating the already established cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.” Not more than last week, International Business Times insisted “a half dozen contenders” in Iran were vying to bring the country its first set of initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Indeed, Iran under the weight of international sanctions seems to be a perfect breeding ground for cryptocurrency. Paypal, Mastercard, Visa are all forbidden. Its fiat currency continues to fall against the dollar to all-time lows even as its regime struggled recently to reform interest rates and forgive loans. Crypto might be a way around pretty brutal financial conditions. Reports last year seemed to suggest the country was considering as much.

Iran Front Page, however, an independent news aggregation site, is throwing cold water on region some by insisting the Iranian central bank never recognized bitcoin as legal tender. The banker also said it had no intention of “actively facilitating Bitcoin transactions.”

Local Crypto?

Indeed the bank is reported to have explained how “wild fluctuations of the digital currencies along with competitive business activities underway via network marketing and pyramid scheme [tactics] have made the market of these currencies highly unreliable and risky.” Additionally, Iran’s central bank is said to be looking at a way to “control and prevent digital currencies in Iran.”

This doesn’t necessarily mean ICOs can’t take place, and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence Iranians are interested in cryptocurrency even if their government is not. Enthusiasts’ hopes were not entirely dashed as reports also explained the country’s technology minister confirmed rumors about a local cryptocurrency, state backed. After further warning about the “high risks of making investment in” cryptos such as bitcoin, saying Iranians might lose “their financial assets” as a result, “Iran’s [Ministry of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)] Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi also declared on Wednesday that Iran’s Post Bank is working on a locally-developed cryptocurrency, which needs to be tested by the ICT ministry.”

Starting in late 2017 Venezuela’s President Nikolas Maduro began expanding heavily into media space in an attempt to promote a new payment instrument– the government-issued cryptocurrency Petro.

On Feb. 20 the pre-sale of Petro was launched and has already raised $735 mln, according to Maduro’s Twitter. Total amount of PTR issued for sale is 100 mln and is worth $6 bln. The pre-sale will end on March 19.

The following questions are raised by this controversial project: what is Petro in an economic context and what would be its possible real use in the global economy? Is it a cryptocurrency, a stable coin, oil futures, new government debt instrument or something else? What is its possible economic impact? Which legal issues could follow?

Having carefully studied the Petro white paper and other data available, we present below the results of the analysis.

Venezuela now

According to Maduro, Petro being backed by the Venezuelan crude oil is one of the best ways to use new technologies to restore the financial condition of Venezuela. For many years, the country has been suffering from hyperinflation by thousands of percent per year, while US sanctions cut off Venezuela from international capital markets.

A huge deficit of US dollar monetary supply has led to the absence of basic goods and a tenfold price discrepancy between official and black market currency exchanges for the Venezuelan bolivar and US dollar. That said, this financial catastrophe coincides with Venezuela’s status as possessing the largest volume of readily retrievable proved oil reserves as assessed by OPEC, being well ahead of well-known oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and others.

But it seems even more alarming news are boiling up. The US administration was urged to impose a full embargo on Venezuelan oil in the near future. According to export statistics, US is the main market for Venezuelan oil and a primary source of ‘hard currency’- US dollars. The excluding of the market from the oil export structure could lead to an even more dramatic economic situation in the country.

The idea of issuing cryptocurrency by the government has been suggested before (Japan, UAE, Russia, and some others), but has so far fallen short of authorization by top officials and practical implementation.

Petro has received official recognition from the Venezuelan government. President Maduro has signed a white paper clearly specifying the conditions and dates of the tokensale. Its activity is aimed at both internal and external markets and carried out at ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America) and OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) levels as well.

El Petro white paper

The original white paper, published on the official website of Venezuela’s government describes the process of issuing Petro. The initial disbursement will be made on the Ethereum platform as a standard ERC20 token. It also states that the Petro price will be correlated with one barrel of Venezuelan crude oil.

The basic items of Petro are mentioned in the white paper as follows: (all the information in this table is the white paper summary and the details are stated as they are in the original document):

Petro: general information

Petro is not solely a token equal to the raw oil barrel price. They are looking at more broad functioning:

A transitory asset for exchange to goods and services, and also fiat money

A digital platform for emittance and trade of stable crypto assets backed up by raw minerals

A store of savings and an investment tool

Unfortunately, the Whitepaper is drafted in common language without any detail on an assumed technological base to launch a full-stack digital platform. Plans to develop such a platform are also absent.

Petro: initial emission and distribution information

100 mln coins will be emitted at launch. Their initial distribution is planned as follows:

38.4% presale

44% public sale

17.6% will be stored in possession of Venezuela’s Superintendence of Cryptocurrencies and Related Activities (SUPCACVEN)

El Petro’s minimum unit is called the ‘mene’ and equals 10-8 Petro. ‘The total emission of El Petro is to be carried out at the initial coin offering,’ further down in the document we find that ‘an additional emission can be made as per the result of El Petro holders vote: 1 coin equals one vote.’

Petro: economic use cases

The project’s architecture is aimed at El Petro’s maximum involvement into settlements between economic agents. The main use cases are as follows:

As means of payment for Venezuelan oil via direct exchange of cryptocurrency to real oil dispatch

As a legal means of payment on the territory of Venezuela, which allows for tax payments, exactions, duties and official acceptance as the settlement by individuals and businesses. To intensify the use there is a special discount index (Dv)**:

Acceptance price of petro = PriceOil/Bolivar*(1-Dv)

**Dv will be at least 10%

Apparently, this means that paying taxes and any other settlements with state bodies would be at least 10 percent cheaper in El Petro at the current exchange rate than in traditional currency (i.e. in Bolivars).

In the future, the use of Petro is planned to be expanded into other payment markets promoting its use in the world as a stable currency backed up by a real resource.

Petro: legal aspects

As the document states, Petro will fully comply with Venezuela’s legislation. However, the opposition in the National Assembly publicly claimed that issuing Petro was illegal. Some operations with Petro, such as initial sales, subsequent exchange to oil and other assets at ‘authorized exchange sites’ will be carried out in strict compliance with KYC/AML, yet the standards for these are not stated in the document.

Overall the document goes well beyond the scope in which Petro was covered by the media in late December and early January. Earlier it was considered to be simply a cryptocurrency backed up by oil. However, over the course of deeper investigation into the white paper, one could see that it also announces future creation of a platform for e-commodities (digital representation of goods/raw materials), greatly expanding the concept.

At the same time, some parts of the Whitepaper lack fine details, and some statements are not backed by any sufficient explanation. Some items feature information that could seem contradictory. A more thorough white paper with extra technical details would probably spark much more interest and trust in global crypto community.

Economic aspects

Petro could be described as ‘a legal payment instrument’ or ‘a legal tender’ applicable by the government. The concept raises the question of determining the use of a single currency as a legal payment instrument for goods and services to businesses, individuals and the government. This leads to several basic assumptions:

Any individual or business must accept this medium of settlement as payment in a private or public transaction

accept this medium of settlement as payment in a private or public transaction All taxes, levies, duties and excise duties as well as other payments to state bodies can be made solely in this currency (currencies)

In the case of Petro, the government, businesses, and individuals can (but are not obliged) to accept it as the currency for all the payments and levies. Despite the fact that the whitepaper declares the maximum intensification of Petro use – up to the discount index, which actually makes it more beneficial for use on the market compared to the Bolivar – we still cannot confirm that Petro fully corresponds to the concept of a legal means of payment. It is a payment instrument that has the attributes of a legal means of payment but is not necessarily such.

In reality, the value of emitted currency is to be ‘secured’ by the liability of Venezuelan government on providing the goods, i.e. the oil, and by its acceptance as the payment to state bodies. In theory, Petro looks more like the currency of the gold-standard period that is technically implemented by virtue of Blockchain technology.

Petro concept

The concept of Petro seems to be both simple and complicated. Up until now, there has been no precedent of issuing cryptocurrencies with such broad functionality to the mass market by the government. Petro is the ‘intersection’ of several familiar concepts from the world of conventional finance.

In Venezuela, Petro stands close to the concept of a legal settlement medium, and in global trade, it is basically a conditionally-stable crypto asset (oil also has specific volatility) that is in fact an oil future without a specific delivery date. Petro could also be assessed as an instrument for tax and levies payment with discounts in a concrete jurisdiction (in the ICO world: a token discount on the unique goods or service of the project). From the investors perspective, at the time of running the crowd sale, the purchase of future oil delivery (the futures) is made with the nominal discount.

New monetary aggregate

That being said, Petro can be conventionally viewed as a new monetary aggregate in the structure of Venezuelan monetary mass. Unlike the Bolivar, it is expected to be easily converted into the US dollar as well as other currencies, which will help Venezuela in export trade.

Therefore, it all comes down to ‘a special monetary aggregate for international payments’. Since it is planned to issue 100 mln coins with each coin equal to one oil barrel (~$60), its total capitalization will amount to $6 bln.

This cost will be actually created during the initial offering with the Venezuelan government receiving several billion of real US dollars from investors. Taking into account the correlation with the oil price and based on the price range starting from 2008 ($30-$150 BBL), we could claim that this monetary aggregate will amount to somewhere between $3 bln and $15 bln. The white paper doesn’t have any grounding on why this specific amount of coins is issued. However, this amount should probably be calculated according to the country’s demand in US dollars and foreign trade transactions.

Payment in Petro

From now on by order of Nicolás Maduro the oil state corporation PDVSA is obliged to carry out transactions in Petro. Moreover, all public and private services like hotels or services of the Venezuelan consulates can now legally accept Petro as means of payment. At the same time, the circulation of digital currency has not even started yet, but Maduro is already preparing a full-fledged legislative and actual infrastructure for future acceptance of Petro.

Questions arise

Many questions arise upon scrutinizing the project, and finding answers to them might clear up the future of Petro. Here we’d like to list some major concerns:

Is it a currency or an oil future? And to what extent is it legal? Taking into account Venezuela’s condition under economic sanctions, it’s highly unlikely that this monetary tool will be easily accepted by the global community. And if it is not, Petro investors and users could get into trouble with the law in jurisdictions outside Venezuela. Whats are the risks of money laundering through Petro? There’s a clear possibility that it could be purchased with the funds that were received illegally at crypto exchanges or privately, and then exchanged to oil that can be ‘laundered’ and documented to eventually be sold under above-board business practices in various jurisdictions. Taking into consideration the political and economic situation in Venezuela and the level of corruption, it’s very likely that KYC/AML could become a rather byzantine procedure. Another question is whether major crypto exchanges would agree to list a token that is contradictory in terms of legal compliance. The project is initially issued at a digital platform. However, there is zero information on the technical parameters of the future blockchain system. What is the discount index going to be like? The white paper states that ‘no less than 10 percent’ will be available. This could be a point of leverage for Petro’s popularity in the country. It should be noted that introduction of Petro could put Venezuelan national currency Bolivar into even more miserable condition. The issue of additional issuance is not fully transparent. If it is done with consideration to holders’ votes, then apparently the government will profit from accumulating >50 percent of the coins and sooner or later start disseminating whichever amounts it chooses. On the one hand, it is useful for Venezuela’s economy: it could actually put into full swing the printing of ‘hard currency,’ on the other hand, a trust issue could arise.

To be continued...

Petro has set a precedent of bringing a cryptocurrency to the market which was created by and government and secured by a physically tangible resource. This instrument features broad functionality that is close to regular money and conventional financial instruments.

However, at the moment the project raises a lot of concerning questions and provides few answers. It still looks more like a beautifully crafted concept than a real and viable financial instrument which could operate worldwide.

It should be noted that initially, the cryptocurrency world is in the state of postindustrial economy, i.e. an economy of communities which independently emit the values determining cost on their own. Therefore, any attempt to secure the cost by virtue of some kind of liabilities is pretty risky. As history shows, the emitters of money like to renege on financial liabilities. Taken Venezuela’s negative reputation on world financial markets, one might think twice about the promise of Petro.

So the big question is still there: is Petro a stable coin for the world’s crypto economy or merely an illegally emitted oil future? It remains to be seen.",,https://www.thedailybeast.com/tales-from-the-cryptocurrency-the-bitcoin-mystery-death-thats-rocking-south-korea,"TOKYO—Days after South Korea’s chief proponent of regulating cryptocurrency, Jung Ki-joon, was found mysteriously dead in his home, South Korea apparently has decided not to crack down further on trading in bitcoin and other cybercurrencies. On Tuesday, Choe Heung-ski, chief of South Korea’s Finance Supervisory Service, told reporters that the government would support cryptocurrency trading rather than heavily regulating it or banning it completely.

The value of bitcoin nearly doubled from the year’s low in response, rising to around $11,000 for one BTC. The loosening of South Korea’s grip on regulations is good news for those speculating on cryptocurrency, but some are wondering if there could be any causal relationship, even an indirect one, to the death of Jung.

Jung Ki-joon was in charge of economic issues at the Office for Government Policy Coordination and is credited with tightening South Korea’s regulation of cryptocurrency trading. South Korea’s semi-official state news agency, Yonhap News, reported that Jung, 52, was found dead in his home on Sunday this week.

According to local media reports, Jung was working on legislation that would diminish criminal activity connected to cryptocurrency and also dampen widespread speculation. Last month, at a government briefing, Jung insisted that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin were not a form of legal tender. He warned that the government planned to “strongly respond to excessive cryptocurrency speculation and illegal activity.”

Yonhap reported that Jung had been working long hours and was under great pressure. The police are investigating the exact cause of death. Perhaps he was aware that his work was about to be essentially scuttled by the South Korean government, aggravating his stress. For now, no one knows the answer.

South Korea’s Volatile Approach to Cryptocurrency

South Korea, which is the third largest market for cryptocurrency, has been sending mixed signals about how it would handle its booming bitcoin business since last year, shaking up the markets in the process.

In late 2017, it began cracking down on bitcoin traders and it appeared poised to ban all trading. It did block initial coin offerings and stopped allowing anonymous cryptocurrency accounts. Early this year, South Korean officials hinted that a complete ban on cryptocurrency trading was being planned, but met with massive opposition, especially from students.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s approval ratings sank rapidly in mid-January after news reports suggested that cryptocurrency exchanges would be shut down. Many young South Koreans see the trade in bitcoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies as their only real chance at acquiring wealth in a country where the odds are stacked against them. While the anger of citizens rose, bitcoin prices also tumbled.

South Korea’s Financial Services Commission on Jan. 23 put out a press release, entitled “Financial Measures to Curb Speculation in Cryptocurrency Trading,” which gave notice that the commission would only allow trade in cryptocurrencies from established-name bank accounts. The rules were intended to make sure banks identified their customers and complied with anti-money-laundering (AML) obligations.

The release stated, “Under the bank account new rule, users who want to make cryptocurrency transactions must have a bank account under their real name at the same bank with cryptocurrency exchanges. Those who do not have their real-name account at the same bank will only be allowed to withdraw money from their existing bank account. To make new deposits, they are required to open a new bank account under their real name at the same bank with the exchanges.” The regulations also forbade those under the age of 18 and foreigners from opening new bank accounts linked to cryptocurrency exchanges. Even harsher restrictions were being considered.

The reasons for banning foreigners from opening new bank accounts for cryptocurrency trading were not simply xenophobic, although that could be possible. There were economic and national-security concerns also at play.

Korea has become a major hub of crypto-speculation. Because many cryptocurrencies trade higher on South Korea's exchanges than in the rest of the world, trades there are known to have what has been dubbed “ The Kimchi Premium ”—added value—and this has attracted many traders and speculators, some of dubious character.

Korea’s Cold Feet

Korean officials in the country have tended to view cryptocurrency buying and selling as a form of gambling, a means of tax evasion, and a vehicle for money laundering. In addition, Korean government officials have also asserted that North Korea is using cryptocurrency to skirt economic sanctions, make money, and even outright stealing cryptocurrency to finance its military. Early this February, Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers there was a possibility that North Korea was behind the theft of the $530 million worth of the cryptocurrency NEM, which was hacked from Japan’s cryptocurrency exchange, Coincheck. They did not offer any solid evidence to support this claim, however.

The decision not to tighten restrictions further on cryptocurrency may be a boon for the Korean economy, which, like Japan, is trying to become a world center of cryptocurrency trading. Roughly 5 percent of all global transactions last year used the South Korean currency, the won, making it the fourth most used fiat currency in trading. However, with so much money wrapped up in cryptocurrency in South Korea, especially by young investors, a market crash could do extensive damage to the economy, affecting everyone. Ironically, the impetus to tighten restrictions on trading in cryptocurrency and the risks associated with those trades, seems to have died mysteriously with Jung Ki-joon.",2018-02-22 09:51:13+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/investing-app-robinhood-launches-crypto-trading-in-5-us-states,"Mobile app stock trading provider Robinhood has formally launched cryptocurrency trading, rolling the new service out to five U.S. states today.

The company says that residents of California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire can can now buy or sell bitcoin and ether using the new Robinhood Crypto platform. The service will also allow investors to track 14 other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash, litecoin, XRP, ethereum classic, zcash, monero, bitcoin gold and dogecoin.

In first announcing the new offerings last month, Robinhood said the move was part of a push to bring cryptocurrencies to a wider audience of investors, using a platform which “democratizes” trading by expanding the pool of possible investors through its mobile and web-based apps.

According to its website, the company makes both traditional and cryptocurrency trading more accessible by offering “zero commission trading” to its customers.

The announcement provided some metrics as to how the firm is reaching new investors, saying:

“Together, we reached four million users and well over $100 billion in transaction volume on our brokerage platform, leading to over $1 billion in commissions saved in equity trades. With the release of Robinhood Crypto, we’re continuing our mission of making the financial system work for everyone, not just the wealthy.”

In addition to Robinhood Crypto, the company announced the launch of Robinhood Feed, a social media-type platform which will enable investors to discuss different cryptocurrencies, news surrounding the space and the markets in real-time.

The Feed platform is currently only available to a limited number of people, according to the announcement.

Last week, the House Science Committee held a hearing titled “Beyond Bitcoin: Emerging Applications for Blockchain Technology.” The week before, at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on cryptocurrencies, the heads of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, J. Christopher Giancarlo and Jay Clayton, respectively, testified about their regulatory approach in this area. Most of their testimony focused on fraud in the initial coin offering marketplace.

The Senate hearing was not about protecting the public: It was about turf. Both agency heads appeared to be using the attention on ICOs and potential — in some cases, actual — fraud to get additional budget resources they can’t otherwise obtain.

They both missed an opportunity to describe how they would use a new and potentially very effective technology — blockchain — to protect the public. Blockchain, which is used to structure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, is expected to have applicability across a wide number of industries. We recently completed a survey to collect opinions on the most appropriate applications for blockchain technology. It turns out that most blockchain developers and aficionados do not believe cryptocurrency is the “killer app” for blockchain — respondents instead pointed to “establishing and safeguarding digital identity” and “establishing ownership rights” as the two top uses.

Yet these findings most clearly link to the mission of a treasury department, not a securities regulator.

It is important to note that, as of today, the SEC does not have direct authority over cryptocurrencies or ICOs. When blockchain is used for currency — or in the case of other emerging applications for the technology — I would argue that the Department of the Treasury, given its clear and historical role in the area of the U.S. currency, has primary regulatory responsibility over this new marketplace. For a number of reasons, this should remain the operational structure used, with Treasury as the lead regulator.

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are simply too potentially important and impactful for the SEC’s smaller, narrower regulatory footprint. The SEC might be given some limited ability to regulate blockchain applications, such as in the case of ICOs, that pass the so-called Howey Test — a standard created by the Supreme Court to determine which transactions qualify as “investment contracts.” In cases where a transaction is considered a security, the SEC may have a role to play.

If Treasury adopted oversight of cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, it may want to create a new office or division to manage this emerging financial marketplace. In this way, the regulatory structure would not be tied to old institutional frameworks, frameworks that are notoriously inappropriate for innovative technologies.

This division should also be freed from traditional civil servant pay restrictions, allowing Treasury to scour the country in search of talent.

Of course, it is more likely that Congress will give the SEC direct authority to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges. This is the easy thing to do, but it would also be a mistake. With an entirely new, fast moving, impactful market to regulate, the SEC has already shown signs that it will impose a heavy-handed regulatory approach, one that favors large financial institutions and discourages small innovators. This approach is entirely unsuited for the growing cryptocurrency marketplace.

Regulators in other parts of the world are eager to take advantage of our mistakes. As we noted back in 2006: ""Competitive advantage with respect to capital access is available to any country with significant economic potential and a modest communications infrastructure.""

Blockchain technology’s potential is simply too positive and large to risk on a regulatory agency with a spotty track record of protecting the public. We think it better to upgrade our regulatory infrastructure in order to be able to fully capture the large anticipated social benefits from this new, exciting technology.",2018-02-22 17:30:07.016,https://news.bitcoin.com/fbi-arrests-exchange-operator-for-lying-about-6000-bitcoin-hack/,"FBI Arrests Exchange Operator for Lying About 6000 Bitcoin Hack

Jon E. Montroll, a 37 year old from Texas, is now facing up to 30 years in jail for perjury and obstruction of justice. The operator of Weexchange and Bitfunder is accused of repeatedly lying to the SEC under testimony in an effort cover up massive client losses after being hacked.

Bitcoin Exchange Operator Arrested by FBI

The FBI announced on Wednesday that Jon E. Montroll (aka Ukyo) was taken into federal custody for giving false sworn testimony and false documentation to the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). He operated two bitcoin services, Weexchange which functioned as a bitcoin depository and currency exchange service, and Bitfunder which facilitated the purchase and trading of shares of businesses that listed on the platform.

During the summer of 2013, hackers stole approximately 6,000 bitcoins from Weexchange, and, as a result, the two ventures lacked the bitcoin necessary to cover what was owed users. Montroll allegedly lied to both investors and investigators in an effort to hide this.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: “SEC investigations rely on learning the full and accurate facts concerning financial markets and products. As alleged, the defendant repeatedly lied during sworn testimony and misled SEC staff to avoid taking personal responsibility for the loss of thousands of his customers’ bitcoins. These charges signify that we will use the full force of the federal criminal law to protect the integrity of the SEC’s investigative process.”

It’s Not the Crime, It’s the Cover-Up

In a November 2013 testimony to the SEC, Montroll denied that the hack had been successful, testifying that when the hackers went to withdraw, “the system stopped them because the amount was obviously causing issues with the system.” He later added that the issue “was corrected immediately, whenever the system started having the problems, and I caught on to what was happening I’d say within a few hours.”

Montroll also gave the SEC a screenshot supposedly showing the number of bitcoins available to Bitfunder users in the Weexchange Wallet as of October 13, 2013. This balance statement reflected 6,679.78 BTC as of that date. However, the investigators say that the evidence revealed that this was a misleading fabrication.

Three days into the incident, Montroll participated in a chat in which he sought help in tracking down “stolen coins.” When that did not work, he allegedly transferred some of his own bitcoin holdings into Weexchange to conceal the losses. The cyber theft, however, continued, and by the time of the balance statement it actually held thousands of bitcoins less than Montroll had asserted, the investigators found.

When confronted with that evidence, Montroll allegedly lied again. While he admitted that the balance statement was the product of his manual intervention in the Weexchange system, he claimed to have discovered the success of the hack only after the SEC had asked him about it during his first day of testimony, and to have no knowledge of the chat.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. commented: “As alleged, Montroll committed a serious crime when he lied to the SEC during sworn testimony. In an attempt to cover up the results of a hack that exploited weaknesses in the programming code of his company, he allegedly went to great lengths to prove the balance of bitcoins available to Bitfunder users in the Weexchange Wallet was sufficient to cover the money owed to investors. It’s said that honesty is always the best policy – this is yet another case in which this virtue holds true.”

As derivatives cannot be legally advertised electronically, the AMF also states that online advertisements for cryptocurrency derivatives are not permitted.

AMF refers to the new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID 2), whose framework lays out the derivatives that must be regulated, like options, futures, swaps or forwards, as well as a list of corresponding underlying assets.

The AMF began an inquiry into the legal definition of a cryptocurrency as both a derivative and an underlying asset after several online crypto trading platforms began offering binary options, contracts for difference (CFD), and Forex contracts where cryptocurrency was the underlying asset. Investors could bet on the outcome of a cryptocurrency without owning any of cryptocurrency itself.

Although cryptocurrency derivatives are not included in the MiFID 2 regulation list, the AMF statement has concluded that “a cash-settled cryptocurrency contract may qualify as a derivative, irrespective of the legal qualification of a cryptocurrency.”

Online trading platforms offering cryptocurrency derivatives must be regulated under MiFID2 and cleared under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). Cryptocurrency derivatives also fall under the jurisdiction of France’s anti-corruption Sapin 2 law, according to the AMF statement.

Bloomberg writes that companies Plus500 Ltd. and IG Group Holdings Plc. have offered such cryptocurrency derivatives. Kelsey Traynor, a spokesperson for Plus500, told Bloomberg that all of the firm’s CFDs are in accordance with the AMF’s framework.

In December 2017, France allowed fintech companies and banks to trade unlisted securities on Blockchain-based platforms as a way to promote France’s reputation as a fintech hub.

France’s Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire appointed Jean-Pierre Landau, or “Monsieur Bitcoin,” in January of this year to head a cryptocurrency task force aimed at preventing criminal activity with crypto.",,https://theconversation.com/why-energy-sapping-bitcoin-mining-is-here-to-stay-92138,"The enormous use of energy needed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is proving to be very contentious, but alternative methods pose far too much of a security risk.

The recent warning that electricity use at bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland may exceed that consumed annually by the country’s homes, which could in turn lead to a potential energy shortage, was slightly alarmist in tone. But it showcases the huge amount of computational power needed to mine cryptocurrencies.

Is the current cryptocurrency mining process really as wasteful and “useless” as critics say, and is it in need of a more efficient and cleaner system?

The current mining process is indeed resource-intensive and wasteful, but there is no magic fix in sight. Many would argue that it’s precisely the “useless” nature of cryptocurrency mining that keeps the system secure.

Bam! PoW! Zap!

Cryptocurrencies are based on a globally distributed ledger shared among all participants in a decentralised network. This ledger is generally organised in the form of a cumbersome data structure – the blockchain – which consists of blocks of transactions that are cryptographically linked to each other. Most cryptocurrencies use a particular mechanism, dubbed proof-of-work (PoW), to determine which participant gets the right to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain.

To prevent dishonest participants from creating multiple identities to manipulate the public vote, PoW requires participants – called miners – to use special software to solve an extremely difficult cryptographic puzzle. In simple terms, solving the puzzle involves guessing a random number between zero and an infinitely large number.

It demands a lot of computational power because, as more machines are used, a miner can quickly try different combinations and increase the odds of solving the puzzle. But cryptocurrency mining comes at a cost in the form of custom hardware and electricity consumption.

Bitcoin miners alone produce tens of quintillion guesses – known under cryptographic terminology as “hashes” – per second. This gargantuan number has risen in tandem with the amount of energy that has been consumed. The main point of contention is that performing these computations doesn’t serve any useful or productive purpose outside of cryptocurrency mining itself.

But attempts to address the seemingly wasted computing power generated by bitcoin mining have largely fallen flat.

Projects over the past few years include Primecoin, a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 that incentivises miners to find a particular sequence of prime numbers. The same year, Gridcoin was launched to reward people for contributing to scientific research projects by requiring miners to perform scientific computations on BOINC, the Berkeley open infrastructure for network computing.

SolarCoin was established in early 2014 to incentivise the generation of solar electricity, and the following year students created MangoCoinz as part of a computer science project that aims to reward miners for performing actual physical work.

But, after initial excitement, all these projects had limited success and are only marginally used today.

More recently, the concept of “virtual mining” has also emerged to address the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining by removing the need for performing computations altogether. This works by tying a miner’s vote proportionally to their cryptocurrency holdings – an approach that became known as proof-of-stake (PoS).

But it’s unclear, according to previous research, whether pure PoS systems can achieve the same high security standards as PoW and there have been incidents to accentuate such doubts. In 2014, it was reported that stolen cryptocoins could be used to attack PoS-based networks. A hack at an exchange controlling 30% of the monetary supply of the cryptocurrency VeriCoin, prompted the project’s developers to implement an emergency measure – rewriting parts of the transaction history – to prevent the hacker from using the stolen coins to attack the blockchain network.

So – for now – PoW remains the best available mechanism to maintain and secure decentralised cryptocurrency systems. Many believe that mining, while energy-sapping, should remain resource-intensive to make it prohibitively expensive for any single entity to gain sustained control over the decentralised system.

Given how quickly computing technology develops, perhaps an alternative method will be found. Until then, we appear stuck – for better or worse – with a drain on computational systems and energy resources to power bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks securely.",2018-02-22 08:21:14+00:00,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/22/1379913/0/en/U-S-Rare-Earth-Minerals-Inc-Creates-a-New-Crypto-Currency-called-EXCERCOIN.html,"Panaca, Nev., Feb. 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc., (OTC-PINK:USMN) announced today that USMN signed an ICO consulting, creation and awareness agreement with Sanwire Software Inc. for a new cryptocurrency called EXCERCOIN (http://excelercoin.com) on the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) CounterParty (XCP).

However, it appears that the country will now opt to avoid joining the global trend, and will alternatively work to create and launch its own state-run cryptocurrency.

Initial support for Bitcoin in Iran stemmed from the positive benefits that it could create for the country. Authorities viewed its integration into the financial infrastructure of the country as a way to ensure its global reach and overcome potential sanctions.

The concern over sanctions refers to the financial constraints imposed by the U.S. in 2012, which led to global financial transaction communications company SWIFT halting operations with the country. The sanctions were eventually lifted, as a result of the Iranian nuclear deal led by former President Obama.

Nevertheless, government officials have now retracted those beliefs in favor of creating their own cryptocurrency, which they believe could provide the same benefits, without jeopardizing their citizens’ funds through exposure to the high volatility associated with Bitcoin and other mainstream altcoins.

According to the Iran Front Page, an independent news site, the country’s central bank recently said in a statement: “The wild fluctuations of the digital currencies along with competitive business activities underway via network marketing and pyramid scheme [tactics] have made the market of these currencies highly unreliable and risky.”

""At TD, we regularly evaluate our policies and security measures, in order to serve and protect our customers, as well as the bank,"" a TD spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday.

The value of Bitcoin soared last year, trading for more than $20,000 per Bitcoin. Since then, the value of the cryptocurrency has come off its all-time highs and trades for around $13,000, but remains up significantly from where it was a year ago.

The comments were part of an annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about the bank's operations and business risks. The bank said it had no further comment.

Bank of America's filing added that widespread adoption of new technologies in financial services, including cryptocurrencies, ""could require substantial expenditures"" in order to adapt to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.

Popular interest in digital currencies has taken off in the last several months, helping send bitcoin from less than $1,000 at the beginning of 2017 to a high above $19,000 in mid-December. The surge of interest led to the launch of bitcoin futures by CME, the largest futures exchange, and its competitor, Cboe, in December as well. Bitcoin was trading well off its record highs Friday, at around $10,000.

However, Bank of America has not embraced the rise of interest in cryptocurrencies. The firm's Merrill Lynch wealth management arm banned its roughly 17,000 financial advisors from buying bitcoin-related investments for clients.

Next week the ethereum classic (ETC) community is expecting to receive coins from a ‘snapshot’ fork called ‘callisto’ (CLO). The clone will be an exact copy of the ETC chain up until block 5,500,000 and ETC holders will receive a 1:1 ratio of CLO coins.

The First High Profile Hard Fork Is About to Get Forked

The funny thing about ethereum classic is that it was one of the first high profile blockchain splits and ethereum (ETH) holders received a 1:1 ratio of ETC after the hard fork at block 1,920,000. The fork was caused by members of the Ethereum community because they rejected the idea to ‘bail out’ the DAO, an ETH application that lost $150Mn that year. Some individuals firmly believe that ETC is the ‘one true’ Ethereum network. Callisto, however, is not quite like the ETC hard fork as it’s a snapshot much like bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, and the other clones that appeared over the past year.

Callisto Developers Believe CLO Will Have Better Smart Contract Security

Essentially CLO coins will share the same history as the existing ETC chain but from block 5,500,000 and forward the network will be its own. The cloning is expected to happen next week sometime on or after March 2. The reason behind the snapshot is because CLO developers believe there are issues regarding ETC’s smart contract design. According to the CLO white paper ETC is susceptible to smart contract hacks much like the DAO platform. The CLO developers plan to create a “Official Smart-contract Auditing Department of CLO & ETC,” so one could assume the snapshot may be considered an extension of the ETC community.

“The main goal of callisto is to research and develop a reference implementation of self-sustaining, self-governed, self-funded blockchain ecosystem and development environment,” explains the CLO white paper.

Callisto aims to establish a secure and contribution-friendly environment for further protocol development and improvements. It will rely on a built-in system of smart-contracts to achieve this goal.

Cold Staking and a Developer Called Dexaran

There’s little information on the creators of the ETC clone other than the Github page that describes the callisto network project in more detail. The developer working on the project goes by the name Dexaran, and he also has worked on an ICO called ‘DEX.’ Another aspect of the project is the introduction of ‘Cold Staking’ which acts similarly to the Proof of Stake consensus system that rewards currency holders.

“It should be noted that the ETC does not have any incentives for coin holders — The whole emission is completely controlled by miners, and their influence grows with the growth of the network. Callisto introduces a Cold staking protocol that rewards coin holders for being network participants,” explains the callisto team.

Cold staking is a smart-contract based process that allows CLO holders to earn interest in a total CLO emission when they hold CLO coins at their balances for long enough period of staking time (1 month by default). Cold stakers are not required to run a node to participate in cold staking process. Cold stakers are not validating transactions and the whole system can remain fully PoW (Proof of Work) which is important since ETC adheres to POW consensys.

The ETC Snapshot Follows the Recent Birth of the Litecoin Cash Network

The upcoming ethereum classic snapshot has boosted the price of ETC quite a bit, and the currency had reached a high of $45 two days ago. It also follows the recent litecoin (LTC) snapshot called litecoin cash (LCC) which came to life on February 20. Before the LCC fork, the price of LTC spiked considerably as well but has since lost those gains. The clone has minimal infrastructure and is only worth 2 percent of LTC’s price at $4-5 per LCC.

Following is a transcript of the video.

Sara Silverstein: So Overstock.com has been accepting bitcoin for as long as I can remember anyone has.

Patrick Byrne: We were the first. We were the first — there was a — the largest company then accepting bitcoin was an $800,000 a year restaurant diner in western Australia. We stepped up and started taking it — we were $1.4 billion. So we often — I like to think that we saved that community about five years in their adoption cycle.

Silverstein: And how much of bitcoin are you transferring to cash right now?

Byrne: Now we only transfer 50% and the rest we keep in bitcoin. And then periodically, we do — we have cashed in bitcoin and made a few million dollars along the way or five million dollars somewhere like that. But generally, as we go along, we do 50% retain bitcoin 50% USD.

Silverstein: And where do you think the bitcoin price should be?

Byrne: No idea. No idea. Wherever millions of people through their trading say it should be. I can't read their — there's no way anyway —

Silverstein: Yeah, and are you interested in everything cryptocurrency? Or are you really interested in the blockchain? Where do you separate the two?

Byrne: Well I'm not really interested in cryptocurrencies per se. Although in general, I guess there's nothing wrong with me saying there is an open-source project of which I'm really letting something big out of the bag here. I'll tell you. But there's an open-source project called Ravencoin, which Overstock has put millions of dollars into teams. We have people contributing to this open-source project. We think this coin actually has quite a future. It's about — it's bitcoin, but a thousand times more energy efficient. And there's other real interesting virtues to it — so Ravencoin. But other than that, I stay out of the cryptocurrency game. I'm building the — we're focusing on applications of this technology and not just betting on coins themselves.

Silverstein: And is that the primary purpose of Ravencoin is to be a more energy efficient version of some of these other cryptocurrencies?

Byrne: That's — I'd say that's the first feature it brings to the world. What I hear — from the open-source community and on the message boards — I know what they are working on and it seems — it's really quite a — I think it has — it was launched January 3 and it's as this open-source project. And I think it has more — last I heard — the number of miners who are now working on it — or it has spread faster than any number of miners of any coin introduced. It's really quite a phenomenon this Ravencoin. So — and what's nice it's democratized. Yeah, it — what happens is, you know, all these coins like bitcoin and such are built on — there's a processor that's solving mathematical problems. And it's possible to build chips that specialize in just that problem. And so you really can't — with your home computer, you're not going to mine any bitcoin anymore unless you have this dedicated ASIC chip. Well, Ravencoin was designed, so you can't do that — it's ASIC resistant. And that's because the problem that you solve keeps flipping randomly among a bunch of class of problems. Anyway, you can't solve it efficiently with an ASIC’s chip, which means it redemocratizes mining. Anyone can download this software, and you don't have an advantage by having this big mining warehouse in China.

Silverstein: And what's your life philosophy? I know you've ridden your bike across country five times?

Byrne: Four times

Byrne: Don't remind me —

Silverstein: I know, just exaggerating —

Silverstein: And you obviously run your company different than a lot of people run their companies.

Byrne: Is it that obvious?

Silverstein: Yeah, just a little bit. What would you say your philosophy is? What keeps you going? What keeps you creative?

Byrne: Really? No one has ever asked me that question. Truth is it's service. That's what we're all here for — is service. You know, at some point in your life, you realize it's not about me, and it's not about gaining stuff, it's finding ways to serve other people.",2018-02-23,https://bitcoinist.com/turkcoin-turkey-politician-national-bitcoin/,"News Turkcoin? Turkey Politician Advises National Crypto To Profit From Bitcoin

A senior Turkish politician has repeated claims from the country’s deputy prime minister that it will seek to create ‘Turkcoin,’ its own national cryptocurrency.

Opposition Demands Regulation

Several weeks after the ruling Justice and Development Party’s Mehmet Şimşek suggested the idea, Ahmet Kenan Tanrikulu, deputy chair of the opposition Nationalist Movement Party and former Industry Minister, argued a method was needed to “generate revenue” from Bitcoin.

“The introduction of encouraging regulations after assessing all kinds of risks would enable us to generate revenues from the cryptocurrency market, especially from bitcoin,” he wrote in a dedicated report on the topic quoted by various outlets.

“In this context, the country needs a bitcoin bourse and legislation to regulate this realm.”

Also arguing for the creation of a “Blockchain database,” Tanrikulu’s support comes at a time when ruling lawmakers have come out against cryptocurrency propagation.

In November 2017, state agency even directly advised against cryptocurrency ownership as it was “not suitable” for Muslims.

“Buying and selling virtual currencies is not compatible with religion at this time because of the fact that their valuation is open to speculation,” the Directorate of Religious Affairs wrote in response to a consumer inquiry.

Go Crypto ‘Before It’s Too Late’

Floating the concept of directly profiting from cryptocurrency markets would thus constitute a significant moral and legislative U-turn should Tanrikulu make any progress.

Speaking to local news resource Al-Monitor, he argued that it was merely a question of ‘not if, but when’ authorities realize they are too late to leverage the benefits of the emerging financial phenomenon.

“The world is advancing toward a new digital system. Turkey should create its own digital system and currency before it’s too late.”

National cryptocurrencies have hit the headlines again this week as Venezuela launches its oil-pegged Petro token, while closer to Turkey’s borders, Iran announced it would consider a similar concept while its central bank suggested it would look to “control and prevent” cryptocurrency usage.

Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitwise HOLD 10 Index was launched in November 2017 and consists of the world’s top 10 largest cryptoassets. It delivered returns of 45% during the first two full months of its operation versus a 1.7% return for a concentrated investment in bitcoin during the same time period. (See also: Why Buy This Expensive Bitcoin Trust Instead Of Actual Bitcoin?)

The last three months have been an especially volatile period in bitcoin’s price trajectory. In December, the original cryptocurrency rapidly climbed its way to almost $20,000. January brought bad news, however, and its price fell into a funk, dropping by more than 50 percent at one time. As of this writing, a single bitcoin is worth $9,890.

Bitwise Asset Management’s index fund beat bitcoin’s returns during both bull and bear markets. It delivered returns of 78% versus bitcoin’s 39% in December. In January, the fund’s value fell by only 18% versus 27% for bitcoin.

How Did Bitwise Beat Crypto Markets?

To beat cryptocurrency markets, the index exploited the lack of correlations among cryptocurrencies. According to Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise, this ensures that many large cryptoassets don’t move “in the same direction at the same time historically.”

As an example, Horsley says Dash’s price has a 1% correlation with that of bitcoin while NEO and Ethereum have a correlation of 20% and 38%, respectively, in their prices with bitcoin. Bloomberg conducted similar analysis recently and found that cryptocurrency prices had less synchronicity during periods of trader bullishness and moved in tandem during bearish behavior. (See also: Are Bitcoin Price And Equity Markets Correlated?)

“For a diversified portfolio like the Bitwise HOLD 10, this has meant better performance than Bitcoin,” said Horsley. That performance has ensured that the fund’s investors have not run away during a reversal of fortunes in cryptocurrency markets.

Horsley says his investors, who span a broad spectrum from individuals to trusts and billionaires, have not requested redemptions. “In fact, some actually increased their investment during the window and we continued to receive investment from new clients,” he said, adding that there is a “continued shift” in new allocations for cryptocurrencies.

Bitwise may also have new products planned for the future. It made a splash recently after news that ETF industry veteran Matthew Hougan was joining it as vice president of research & development. “It’s (the possibility of an ETF) absolutely of interest,” said Horsley. “An ETF, or other public fund, can provide access through traditional channels to a broader set of constituents and I think it will be a great thing for investors.”

In an interview with Bloomberg, Hougan himself alluded to the possibility of a differently-structured ETF. He said he was working on “defining index methodology for the digital-asset market, saying that criteria such as market capitalization and weightings should be structured differently from traditional asset classes.”

Over 34,000 ethereum smart contracts containing $4.4 million in ETH may be vulnerable to exploitation. That’s the conclusion reached by a quintet of researchers hailing from Singapore and the UK. Their technical report, which is currently undergoing peer review, suggests that millions of dollars in ether may be at risk from poorly coded smart contracts that contain a variety of bugs.

Also read: Bad Code Has Lost $500 Million of Cryptocurrency in Under a Year

Smart Contracts Are Only as Smart as Their Creator

“Finding The Greedy, Prodigal, and Suicidal Contracts at Scale” is the provocative title of a research paper submitted by British and Singaporean students last week. Its authors have dived deep into ethereum smart contracts, “finding contracts that either lock funds indefinitely, leak them carelessly to arbitrary users, or can be killed by anyone”. This latter flaw is precisely what happened to Parity last November.

The dangers of relying on smart contracts that have not been independently audited are well-documented. In the past year, $500 million has been lost due to bad code, and around half of that figure involved ethereum. The most notorious case was the Parity bug which led to $168 million of ether being rendered permanently inaccessible, though there have been plenty of smaller incidents where inexperienced or inattentive developers have been caught out.

A Small Drop in a Big Ocean

The authors of the report claim to have used a tool to analyze almost one million smart contracts, of which 34,200 were found to be vulnerable, with 2,365 of these stemming from distinct projects. That means that around 3.4% of all smart contracts are potentially vulnerable to being hacked, broken, or otherwise exploited. Of the contracts that the research team flagged as being exploitable, “the maximal amount of Ether that could have been withdrawn…is nearly 4,905 Ether” worth $4.4 million.

The report continues: “In addition, 6,239 Ether (7.5 million US dollars) is locked inside posthumous contracts currently on the blockchain, of which 313 Ether (379,940 US dollars) have been sent to dead contracts after they have been killed.” One thing the report deliberately omits is the identity of the smart contracts flagged as being at risk. But with almost 1 in 20 contracts vulnerable, and a jackpot of over $4.5 million in ether up for grabs, determined attackers have every incentive to put this research to the test.

Over the past few years, colleges and universities all over the world have been creating courses revolving around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Now the subject is slowly infecting the halls of high school students who want to learn about these emerging technologies. Because of the increased student interest, this week a Business and Personal Finance teacher from Union Catholic High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey announced plans to add the topic of cryptocurrencies to his course next semester.

Younger Generations Are Becoming Very Interested In Bitcoin

Students all over the world are interested in cryptocurrencies and the subject is being taught throughout many college campuses. However, the trend is starting to find its way into high school classrooms as younger scholars are fascinated by this technology. Just recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on a high school in Brisbane Australia where students had such an interest in bitcoin that it prompted students to create a cryptocurrency information night. This week the students at Union Catholic High School in Scotch Plains, New Jersey are also curious about digital currencies and the school’s Business and Personal Finance class plans to add cryptocurrencies to the course next semester.

If One Student is Talking About it, Many of Them Are

Mr. Tim Breza’s business course is an elective class that teaches subjects like personal finance techniques, entrepreneurship, investments, and more. Mr. Breza’s course designed for juniors and seniors at Union Catholic will soon discuss blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and the history of cryptographic innovation. According to Mr. Breza, a few students began talking about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They asked the teacher his thoughts on the subject and asked if he knew about bitcoin.

“If one student’s talking about it, many of them are talking about it,” Breza said. “So I figured we needed to include it,” explains Mr. Breza.

I am very excited that the students and Union Catholic are being exposed to this… and that the UC administration supported teaching this to our students — Not too many schools are even thinking about teaching about cryptocurrency. We’re not teaching it in the sense that you have to invest in it, we are just giving the facts of it. Blockchain is the key to all of this. That’s the revolutionary piece to it.

The Next Step of Teaching What the Future of Investments Will Be

Scholars at Union Catholic (UC) are taking a liking to the new course idea, and some of them have previously invested in cryptocurrency. Max Berg, a junior from UC purchased BTC last year and cashed out just before it hit $20K.

“UC is always on the edge of new technology with our laptops and other things, so this is just that next step of teaching what the future of investments are going to be,’’ said Berg.

It’s been a hobby of mine for years now, and it’s cool to see how big it has gotten, and that the school is open to teaching about it is great.

Many other students at UC are excited about the cryptocurrency course and believe the school and the 28-year old business teacher are looking toward the future. UC senior Thomas Monahan says, “The teachers and administrators at Union Catholic always find ways to give us an edge and help us learn and make us better than other high schools.’’

“They teach us valuable things about life, things that will help us in the future,” Monahan adds.

Senate Bill 464, introduced by Republican state senators, Joshua McKoon and Michael Williams, proposes that “[t]he commissioner shall accept as valid payment for taxes and license fees any cryptocurrency, including but not limited to Bitcoin, that uses an electronic peer-to-peer system.” The bill stipulates that once payments are received, the commissioner will convert the cryptocurrency to US dollars within a period no longer than 24 hours.

This new legislation comes on the heels of very similar measures undertaken Arizona’s state senate in bill passed earlier this month, allowing that, “[a] taxpayer may pay their income tax liability using a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, or any other cryptocurrency recognized by the department, using electronic peer-to-peer systems.” The Arizona bill also stipulates that crypto will be converted to US dollars within 24 hours.

Having already passed its third reading by a narrow margin, Arizona may be one of the first US states to accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments.

Wyoming also recently introduced legislation that would exempt cryptocurrencies from being taxed as property, which has been crypto’s federal classification since 2014. A group of mostly republicans introduced bill SF0111, which proposes a list of “intangible items”, among which are cryptocurrencies, gold, and cashier’s checks, which would be exempt from property taxes.

While initially the news may seem like a boon for crypto users, tax law expert Robert Wood wrote in an expert take for Cointelegraph that using cryptocurrencies to pay taxes could actually lead to paying more taxes, since gains in cryptocurrencies used for tax payments could themselves be subject to capital gains tax and investment income tax.",,https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/24/why-ethereum-weathered-the-cryptocurrency-downturn-better-than-bitcoin/,"If 2017 was a dream for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, 2018 has been a swift return to reality. The value of Bitcoin, which increased over 1,000 percent last year, has decreased by close to 30 percent so far this year, and many other coins have followed suit. The cryptocurrency market has begun a modest recovery, but investors have nonetheless been given a stark reminder that cryptocurrency’s volatility is a double-edged sword — if you want to try and make it “to the moon,” you’ve got to risk crashing down to earth.

One coin that has stayed relatively stable throughout the recent crash, though, is Ethereum. In fact, the value of 1 ether has actually increased by 4.9 percent since January 1, 2018, and its value relative to Bitcoin has grown by nearly 50 percent. So what is it about Ethereum that has allowed it to weather the storm and come out ahead? The short answer: Ethereum is backed by real utility that many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin included, simply don’t have.

Ethereum cofounder, Vitalik Buterin, realized that blockchain technology was capable of supporting far more than just electronic cash systems. Rather than prescribing a narrow range of functions for which users could use the blockchain, he saw the potential for a blockchain platform on which developers could build any application they like. This would allow software designers to get all the benefits of blockchain technology — decentralization, inalterability, security, etc. — without having to build their own personal blockchains. That’s the vision behind Ethereum, and so far it’s been a tremendous success.

Since its release in 2015, Ethereum’s network has become home to thousands of decentralized applications, or dapps. Many of these dapps are still in the development stage and have yet to go live, but Ethereum has set itself up to be the foundation for a huge software ecosystem. Here are a few dapps already live on the Ethereum platform that should give you an idea of the near-infinite range of possibilities:

EtherDelta — EtherDelta is the biggest of many decentralized exchanges for Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies. Because it is run entirely through smart contracts, EtherDelta is a truly decentralized platform that offers numerous benefits, including increased security and the impossibility of fraud.

Because it is run entirely through smart contracts, EtherDelta is a truly decentralized platform that offers numerous benefits, including increased security and the impossibility of fraud. uPort — uPort is a mobile app and software development platform aimed at providing users with a “self-sovereign” identity. Users can establish their electronic identity and link it to various verified claims like citizenship, visas, and certificates. This ultimately allows users to have a secure identity independent of traditional governmental means.

Users can establish their electronic identity and link it to various verified claims like citizenship, visas, and certificates. This ultimately allows users to have a secure identity independent of traditional governmental means. CryptoKitties — The dapp that took the crypto world by storm, CryptoKitties is an online game that lets you collect and breed digital, cartoon cats. Though the concept is about as lighthearted as it could be, the app’s popularity has led to a serious investment of cash. Users have spent millions of dollars buying these animated felines through the app’s online marketplace. Each cat is unique, and secure ownership is maintained through Ethereum’s blockchain. The app’s popularity has declined since its peak around December of last year, but it serves as one of the best examples of the strange yet valuable ideas Ethereum can help to facilitate.

Ethereum not only provides developers with a blockchain on which to build their applications; it also gives them a convenient way to fund their projects natively on the network in the form of tokens. These tokens, often referred to as ERC-20 tokens — which means they are compatible across the Ethereum platform — function similarly to shares of a company. Users buy tokens to help fund software projects, while also receiving investment incentives like financial rewards or voting rights.

These tokens have become some of the most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world, even before the release of their associated dapp. In fact, 17 of the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market cap, not counting Ethereum itself, are ERC-20 tokens. This means there is a tremendous amount of money invested — directly or indirectly — into the Ethereum platform. Ethereum’s own cryptocurrency, Ether, serves less as an electronic cash system and more as a source of fuel for the Ethereum network. Ownership of Ether is therefore an investment in the Ethereum platform rather than an investment in a pure storage of value.

All of this means Ethereum is more resistant to devaluation than other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is similar to fiat currency in that it has value because people agree it has value. This gives Bitcoin some stability, because everyone who has invested in Bitcoin is also invested in keeping it valuable. But it also makes Bitcoin vulnerable to possible crashes if investors begin to lose faith. If the faith goes away, there’s nothing else keeping it afloat.

Ethereum doesn’t fall prey to these same pitfalls because it is more than a currency; it’s a platform that provides a valuable service. As long as Ethereum continues to see investment from developers who want to build on the network, the value of Ether is supported by meaningful capital. If Bitcoin is like fiat, Ether is like gold; its value is more stable because it’s partially backed up by an intrinsic usefulness that Bitcoin doesn’t have. This is at least part of the reason Ethereum proved more resilient during the recent crash.

All that said, it is important to note that Ethereum is still a very young platform and is a long way away from realizing its full potential. It has only a handful of very popular dapps, and developers are still getting used to programming for the network. Therefore much of Ethereum’s value is still speculative. But its ’s recent stability compared to other coins should inspire confidence in its future. As more and more dapps take advantage of the Ethereum blockchain in new and interesting ways, its value should continue to increase. And assuming it can continue to fend off the dramatic swings that dominate the space, it may be setting itself up to become the industry leader.

The linked data was derived from investigations spurred by the recent transaction reporting statutes licensed exchanges are required to follow.

Japanese Police Are Reviewing 669 Alleged Money Laundering Cases Tied to Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms

This week Japanese police told the press that they are reviewing 669 cases that involve possible money laundering and cryptocurrency exchanges. The cases stem from transactions that took place between April and December of 2017. According to the regional reports, the data came from digital currency exchange ‘transaction reporting,’ a licensed cryptocurrency exchange requirement now tethered to the country’s existing AML/KYC laws.

The National Police Agency did not reveal why exchange operators were triggered to report the latest findings. However, while reporting on the recent investigation, Japan’s Nikkei Asia Review states the outcome was due to:

Questionable transactions repeated frequently in a short span of time.

Police Report That 2017 Had Fewer Cases Than the Year Prior

The news also follows the recent Coincheck hack where 58 billion yen ($540 million) worth of the cryptocurrency NEM was lost due to a hack. Coincheck was not among the 16 licensed exchanges in Japan and was waiting for licensure approval. 32 cryptocurrency exchange operators have been dealing with the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) a government agency involved with regulations and reporting requirements.

The National Police Agency also explained that suspected money-laundering cases involved with digital currencies have dropped compared to AML/KYC matters found in 2016. Last year there were 400,043 AML/KYC investigations and that metric was 1,048 cases less than the year before.

Additionally, Japan’s police agency says that most of the transaction reporting derived from banks and other types of financial companies. The agency reports that these institutions reported a total of 346,595 cases. Credit card companies and local credit unions disclosed 28,707 cases to the police department.

After the newly written U.S. tax laws recently passed, cryptocurrency investors realized the tax-free exemption filing 1031 for IRS reporting is no longer applicable to their digital asset investments. The law also implies that a lot of people will have to pay taxes on every single transaction they processed throughout the past twelve months. However, there is one loophole available to cryptocurrency investors, but it involves gifting the funds to another person or charity.

Gifting Cryptocurrencies: The Only Crypto-Tax Loophole

The U.S. government is concerned about getting its taxes from American citizens who have invested in cryptocurrencies. Last year the IRS started to probe businesses that deal with digital assets like the exchange Coinbase. For the moment the tax agency is looking for individuals and groups who have spent over $20,000 using Coinbase. Following this initial probe, the San Francisco exchange has started to send customers the IRS tax form 1099-K. Additionally, investors have realized that 1031 tax-free exchanges won’t apply to digital currencies, and every transaction is also considered a taxable event.

Although, giving bitcoin as a gift is one way investors can avoid paying taxes on their cryptocurrency gains. Gifting money has to be more aligned with donating the funds as opposed to an employee bonus, and there is a fine line between the two financial events. According to Robert Wood, a tax lawyer based in San Francisco, an individual can gift up to $15,000 without documenting the transaction.

“If you give crypto to a friend or family member — to anyone really — ask how much it is worth. If the gift is worth more than $15,000, it requires you to file a gift tax return,” explains Wood.

For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called “annual exclusion.” You can give gifts up to this amount each year to any number of people with no reporting required.

U.S. Citizens Can Gift $11.2 Million Per Lifetime

Wood details that the gift doesn’t trigger income tax requirements for both the giver and the recipient. If the recipient calculates gains or losses (cashes out) from the gift in the future, then the funds will be taxable based on the value the day the gifting happened. Wood details that documenting the gift is helpful because donating money is often written off improperly. If the donation exceeds $15K, then U.S. residents are required by law to file a ‘gift tax return.’ “For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called ‘annual exclusion,’” Wood details.

Further, Wood explains that in 2018 the amount a person or married couple can give per lifetime has increased quite a bit. According to the tax attorney, a person can gift up to $11.2 million tax-free during their lifetime, and married couples can gift up to $22.4Mn. If the individual gives the money to a recognized 501(c)(3) charity, they can get an income tax deduction for the spot value of the digital asset at the time of filing.

A few years ago Dorian Nakamoto was accused of being the ‘real’ Satoshi Nakamoto, and he received thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin. If Dorian kept track of the cost bases across all the bitcoin donations, he received he may have been able to claim the contributions as tax-free gifts. However, if he treated the gifted funds as ordinary income, his gifts would face significantly higher tax rates for his gains.

A little known cryptocurrency called Cardano — or ADA, as its corresponding coin is called — showed up on crypto-tracking sites with a market cap of about $600 million.

At the time, it was unusual to see a new coin appear out of thin air with such a high market cap. But Cardano is different. It's an incredibly ambitious product with a strong team and tons of buzz. By year's end, the market cap of Cardano was more than $10 billion, despite the fact that the project was in a fairly early stage. In January, it briefly soared to more than $33 billion before receding back to roughly $10 billion as the overall cryptocurrency market shrunk. It is currently the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

So what makes the cryptocurrency scene so bullish about Cardano?

Cardano claims it will solve most of the issues that plague well-established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin isn't flexible enough, and transactions on its network are currently slow and expensive due to protocol limitations and overwhelming demand. Ethereum is far more flexible, but — as prominent Ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir recently put it — it's not safe or scalable yet.

But Cardano, at least so it claims, has very secure code, peer-reviewed by experts and scientists. It claims to be fast and scalable, thanks to its Ouroboros proof-of-stake technology. It's written in Haskell, a programming language that's typically used in critical systems in the banking and defense industries. It provides interoperability between existing cryptocurrencies. And finally, it offers long-term sustainability, by using a sort of cryptocoin treasury that can fund projects long-term.

Cardano has a very strong developer team. Its leader is Charles Hoskinson, who studied Analytic Number Theory at the Metropolitan State University of Denver and University of Colorado at Boulder before dropping out to co-found Ethereum, among other projects. He now travels around the world to speak and educate on crypto and promote Cardano; as he moved between time zones, it took me two weeks to align with him and do a phone interview.

Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK Image: Cardano

""We didn't actually do any marketing,"" Hoskinson says of the cryptocurrency's early days. ""When Cardano started trading on Bittrex, it was the first time the rest of the world has actually seen it; the first time they kinda saw the vision, which was this idea of a third generation cryptocurrency, and all this things that we've set up, the research team that we set up, this enormous team we've put together. They saw the code, they saw all the progress, and they said holy moly, we missed this.""

A cryptocurrency built from scratch

Hoskinson refers to Bitcoin and Ethereum as the first- and second-generation cryptocurrencies. They were the first of their kind, and it was impossible for their development teams to prepare for all potential problems in advance. Cardano has the benefit of knowing their history.

""Every component of our system has been built from scratch,"" Hoskinson says. And since all of it has been peer-reviewed by experts and scientists, he claims, it should be more reliable and secure than the code of most other cryptocurrencies. This is important. Parity, a popular wallet for Ethereum, suffered a hack in which unknown actors made away with $32 million, as well as a bug that froze more than $150 million in digital assets, due to errors in its code.

Hoskinson isn't just making claims out of thin air. Cryptomiso, a site that ranks cryptocurrencies according to Github commits — changes in a project's code — currently ranks Cardano as the second most active project. And this code has seen actual usage: Cardano's Oroborous proof-of-stake algorithm is live, and its Daedalus wallet is live.

""You pay a higher upfront fee to do things properly, once you've done that, what happens is you get acceleration, and you don't have to backtrack, because you've done it right the first time.""

But Cardano consists of two layers: A settlement layer, which is similar to Bitcoin, and essentially only takes care of who has sent how much ADA to whom. The other is the control layer, which is similar to Ethereum and enables applications to run on the platform. That part of the project is still undergoing testing.

While reading up on Cardano, I've kept finding similar conclusions: It's very promising, but it's unclear whether it's moving fast enough, due to all the academic rigor involved in its development.

""We're starting very far behind everybody. (...) A lot of the work that we did in 2016 and all throughout 2017 and we're still doing now is about building up to a point where we catch up completely with all of our competitors,"" Hoskinson says. ""The difference between us and a lot of our competitors, is that every time we get involved in something, we write a paper. And the people reviewing these things are cryptographers, experts from universities such as Cornell.""

Better than Bitcoin, better than Ethereum?

""But the good news is that the way we've chosen to approach this (...) we're moving much faster on all cylinders. For example, Ethereum has been working on Casper, its proof-of-stake algorithm, for about three years, off and on. We've only been working on our PoS algorithm, Oroborous, for a year and a half. And despite the fact that we've followed a far more formal process (...) we've made significantly more progress than Ethereum can, to the extent that we have a network running with proof-of-stake at the moment.""

Hoskinson has a deep history with Ethereum. He's a co-founder and has been the project's CEO from Dec. 2013 to May 2014. IOHK, the engineering company co-founded in 2015 by Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood, is best-known for building the main components of Cardano, but it also worked on Ethereum Classic, a fork of Ethereum.

However, throughout our chat, Hoskinson appears to be agnostic about his competitors. In the end, he claims, Cardano will be better than every other project out there, because it allows for interoperability between different projects.

""If you're a smart contract developer, you could be developing for Ethereum today, and when our layer's ready, you can deploy your Ethereum smart contract on our system, and they're gonna run more securely, they're gonna run faster, and they're gonna run cheaper, than it does on Ethereum.""

Hoskinson says the next version of Ouroborous, Shelley, will be done by Q2 of 2018 and Cardano's smart contract layer should be connected to it roughly in September of 2018. Once that happens, he claims, ""pound for pound, we're better than Bitcoin, we're better than Ethereum.""

Solving the big cryptocurrency problems

These days, two arcane terms dominate the discussion on how cryptocurrencies need to move forward: Proof-of-stake and sharding. These are incredibly hard tech problems that nearly every major cryptocurrency team is working on in some form of another. Proof-of-stake makes the energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining largely obsolete as transactions on the network are validated by owners of the coins — i.e. entities that have a stake in the network. Sharding is a term that comes from database tech; in the context of blockchain technology, it splits the chain into smaller parts (shards) that makes the network faster.

Cardano's team says it has the proof-of-stake part solved, but here's the problem: The debate on which PoS approach is the best isn't quite settled.

In a fascinating Twitter exchange from Aug. 2017, Vlad Zamfir, who's building (alongside Vitalik Buterin) the proof-of-stake protocol for Ethereum, criticizes Cardano's approach in a series of tweets (click on the tweet below to see the entire discussion).

I can tell you everything I don't like about Ouroboros in exchange for the sauce ;) — Vlad Zamfir (@VladZamfir) August 1, 2017

Hoskinson jabs at Zamfir about Ethereum code not being peer reviewed. To this, Zamfir replies that ""it takes longer to come up with significant contributions.""

""You guys had a year on us and we still beat you to publication and implementation,"" Hoskinson retorts. The back and forth continues and phrases like ""semi-synchronous model"" are thrown around. Unless you're an expert in this space, don't bother trying to figure out who won this Twitter fight.

The worth of ADA

This is a common problem when evaluating cryptocurrencies: It's complex stuff, and even if you ask the top experts, you'll likely get a bunch of different answers. Cardano is certainly promising but only time will tell whether it can deliver on its promises. However, what most investors want to know is how to determine a fair price for ADA right now.

Hoskinson doesn't really care much about daily market price fluctuations. In fact, on his Twitter he's very critical of people who seem to only care about ADA's current market price.

If you see me trying to boost the price of Ada, then I've been compromised and sell all your Ada. Cardano will be valuable based upon hard work, real world use and the utility of the platform. I'm not here to make day traders rich. I'm here to change the world — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 1, 2018

I asked him about the benefit of owning ADA tokens now, and he pointed me into the far future in which, he thinks, ADA will be the underlying financial system of the world. ""We have a vision that one day we can build a system that can have 3 billion users.""

In other words, if you truly believe in the project, it doesn't really matter what the price is right now. ""If you believe in our vision, then you know there will be a very strong demand (for ADA). Which, by basic economics, means that ADA ought to appreciate,"" he says.

Who's running things around here?

As tough as it is for a layman to figure out whether Cardano is better than its competitors and how, it's nearly equally as challenging figuring out who's actually running the project. On the official Cardano website, three entities are mentioned: The Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo.

""Bitcoin is anarchy,"" Hoskinson tells me. ""And Ethereum is the ultimate kingdom, with one guy at the top; he gets to decide where Ethereum goes.""

Just like how its underlying technology is split into layers, Cardano has split governance into layers as well. ""What we decided is that we need to federate power, so that not one entity gets to be the king,"" Hoskinson says. ""And you can't have chaos, because nothing would get done.""

""Bitcoin is anarchy, and Ethereum is the ultimate kingdom.""

So the power in the Cardano kingdom was divided thusly: IOHK, which is headed by Hoskinson, takes care of development. The Cardano Foundation promotes the project to the world and acts as a sort of a middleman between the other entities, and Emurgo takes care of the business side of things. Note that Emurgo is based in Japan, which could be very important in the future given Japan's lax attitude towards cryptocurrencies.

This structure ensures that there are no conflicts of interest, Hoskinson claims. He names the DAO hack as the example. In June 2016, hackers exploited a vulnerability in the code of the Ethereum-based decentralized VC fund DAO, stealing roughly 3.6 million ether. To repair the damage, Ethereum's management created a hard fork in the software which undid the theft but also ended up splitting Ethereum into two separate cryptocoins: Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (which Hoskinson was involved in, through IOHK, at one point).

""Vitalik was sitting on the (Ethereum) Foundation board (...) and he's also the curator for the DAO. So when the DAO had a problem, guess what: he has legal risk, regulatory risk. (...) That scenario cannot happen with us,"" he says.

Done it right the first time

On paper, it seems that Cardano has thought everything through. Sometimes, though, you have to jump first and think second, which is what Cardano's competitors have done.

Despite Cardano's potential technical and other advantages over both Bitcoin and Ethereum, the fact remains that Bitcoin is extremely well known outside cryptocurrency circles and has the first-mover advantage, while Ethereum has thousands of decentralized apps already running on it, with dozens of ICOs (initial coin offerings) lined up in the near future. Cardano has yet to build the tools for the developers to build such projects. And recruiting developers to a new platform can be a tough task; just ask Microsoft who'd tried, and failed, to bring developers over from iOS and Android to Windows Phone.

Despite his bold predictions for the future, Hoskinson's well aware that Cardano has a lot of catching up to do. In the end, he says, it shouldn't matter.

""You pay a higher upfront fee to do things properly. Once you've done that, what happens is you get acceleration, and you don't have to backtrack, because you've done it right the first time.""

Musk’s cryptocurrency holdings reveal comes after a number of fake accounts posing to be various well-known figures, including Musk, cropped up on Twitter promising crypto donations to those who send them crypto.

On Feb. 22 a Twitter user concerned about the scam accounts asked Musk in a tweet ""why is all the spam popping up lately?""

Evidently as a way of explaining his surprise at the multiple scams, Musk noted in the same tweet that apart from the 0.25 BTC a friend had given to him “many years ago”, he ""literally own[s] zero cryptocurrency.""

The Bitcoin sum he reports to own is indeed an extremely small fraction of Musk’s total net worth, which stands at $21.4 billion as of Feb. 24.

In November 2017, Musk denied rumors suggested by former SpaceX intern Sahil Gupta that Musk was probably Satoshi Nakamoto, the legendary anonymous creator of Bitcoin.

A representative of TD, the first major Canadian bank to enact such a ban, said that the bank regularly evaluates its policies and security measures “in order to serve and protect our customers, as well as the bank.”

TD’s move is part of a larger global trend of banks banning customers from credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. The wave of bans was initiated by US giants J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup on Feb. 3, and followed by the largest bank in the UK, Lloyds Banking Group, Feb. 5, and Virgin Money in Australia, South Africa, and the UK on Feb. 6. Last week, Citibank India went ahead with banning both credit and debit cards for crypto purchases.

According to The Globe and Mail on Feb. 23, the Royal Bank of Canada made of point of stating that it does allow both debit and credit card purchases of cryptocurrency, but it warns its customers about high volatility risks which ""could expose them to substantially higher debt levels than they are able to repay.”

There was a lot of dancing.

Not your nerdy friend’s crypto

Over the course of 2017, cryptocurrency experienced an unprecedented explosion.

After years of quietly languishing below $1,000, the price of a bitcoin began to increase rapidly and public attention along with it. But it wasn’t alone. At the same time, bitcoin’s so-called dominance index, the size of the bitcoin market cap relative to all other cryptocurrencies, shrunk.

The cause? Other established cryptocurrencies like ethereum and litecoin were making their own explosive gains, while scores of entirely new and tokens were created out of thin air en masse with shocking overnight valuations.

An influx of new investors wanted in on this digital gold rush, buying into these new initial coin offerings or “ICOs” as fast as they could be created. Suddenly, everyone was making it big. Self-professed expert blockchain investors and traders were springing up everywhere overnight.

Cryptocurrency was no longer the domain of just cypherpunks, anarchists and radical libertarians. In fact those early groups all but quickly disappeared from the public spotlight in favor of this newer, shinier, get-rich-quick crypto culture.

Fortunes were being made after all, and tales of overnight success are much better media stories than the ongoing and abstruse technical debates about the real use cases, limitations and challenges facing blockchain technology.

Delicately balancing network throughput and decentralization? That’s boring. Making outrageous money fast, and showing it off with Lamborghinis (“Lambos” for short) and extravagant strip club parties? Now that’s exciting.

As the spotlight grew so did the influx of buyers, creating a self reinforcing cycle of irrational exuberance and the ultimate bull run. The problem? No one had any actual idea what exactly it was that they were buying.

Blockchain was simply the newest and coolest buzzword. The biggest takeaway seemed to be that anything it was attached to could make you rich, even if that thing was iced tea.

F.O.M.O.

But there was one problematic fact: In cryptocurrency you are far more likely to buy into an effective scam than “the next bitcoin.”

Anyone can create and market a generic blockchain-based token with little or no added unique functionality. The barrier to entry for creating a new coin is nearly non-existent, and new investors suffering from FOMO (fear of missing out) don’t have the expertise to vet them.

By leveraging pseudo-scientific buzzwords and exploiting these new low-information investors, projects with unsound fundamentals and total scams alike can quickly reach dizzying heights.

A notable example is tron, which at its peak sported a valuation higher than that of Twitter, placing it within the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. What is tron? A standard ethereum-powered token with no special functionality, and a white paper with more questions than answers. Not only is there zero deployed infrastructure or uniquely developed technology behind tron, but the white paper as it turns out was largely unoriginal at best, or totally plagiarized at worst.

Even more alarming than a simple lack of education or due diligence, however, is the fact that perhaps many new cryptocurrency investors don’t actually care.

Take Ponzicoin, the self-proclaimed scam jokingly launched as an outright ponzi-scheme. It raised over $25,000 on the ethereum platform in eight hours before its developer pulled the plug as best he could given the irreversible nature of blockchain smart contracts. Similar openly advertised Ponzi scheme PoWH coin sold $1 million-worth of coins in three days before later being hacked, perfectly encapsulating everything sour about ethereum smart contracts.

These events shows us many new crypto investors seem to be perfectly happy to invest in outright fraud and vapor, so long as they think they believe they won’t be the ones left holding the bag.

Because in the end, who cares? Fortunes were being made, which was in turn attracting even greater amounts of new money to keep the party going. It’s no surprise then that the North American Bitcoin Conference featured so many ICOs and new coins that it could easily be considered a “bitcoin conference” for marketing purposes only.

As it turns out Miami was the perfect outlet for the this newer, flashier and carefree type of crypto.

The signal in the noise

While the cypherpunk and hacker ethos of bitcoin and cryptocurrency have received palpably less attention during the late last year, it’s hardly because it has disappeared.

It’s actually this group that has proven to be the most consistent aspect of the cryptocurrency communities in general and bitcoin’s in particular. Regardless of media attention or short-term market performance their mantra remains the same: cypherpunks write code.

Douglas Oscar and Drew Carey are the founders of Bitstop, a Bitcoin ATM provider based in South Florida. The same week as the North American Bitcoin Conference they hosted their annual Miami Bitcoin Hackathon.

Their motivation?

“All the change and progress is going to come from the developers, not the Lambos and marketing fluff. … All of that stuff that happens at the conference is only possible because of the kind of work people do here,” said Douglas.

You’re unlikely to find a “Lambo” at the hackathon, and for the Douglas that’s a good thing.

But beyond the presence of Lambos, there were other differences noted by attendees of both events.

Software developer and co-founder of development shop Bushido Labs Sam Abassi remarked on his impression of the various ICOs and projects on display at The North American Bitcoin Conference:

“There’s a lot of nonsense, too much hype and no one is deliberating whether or not what they’re doing makes a lot of sense. In the next six months, many of these companies are going to fail when they figure out they can’t deliver. … I felt like the smartest person at the conference. Here I was the dumbest.”

The shared disdain of attendees for the wild speculation in the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem was clearly reflected in the second place winner of the Hackathon: an app called Pump and Dump.

By using the Binance API, Pump and Dump allows you to choose whether to diversify into a large basket of alternative cryptocurrencies, or reconsolidate it back into bitcoin with a simple interface that cuts through all the rhetoric.

Team member Nathan Milian explained it simply: “You press one button ‘Pump’ if you want to just buy a bunch of shitcoins, and ‘Dump’ to sell it all back for bitcoin.”

Drilling down

So, if attendees were in agreement regarding the pervasive nature of distractions in the space, were they in agreement on where research and development efforts were best focused? Not quite.

For their part Abassi and Bushido Labs are dipping their toe into cryptocurrency development for the first time with Kim-Jung Coin, an ethereum-based token in the vein of the popular game CryptoKitties.

“Bitcoin is the OG, but ethereum is just very developer friendly. We just jumped right in and started looking at these other contracts out there and were able to start writing our own,” he said.

Unlike The North American Bitcoin Conference however, the rules of the Bitcoin Hackathon itself strictly limits participation to bitcoin-related projects. “Anything you can do on ethereum you can do with bitcoin,” explained Bitstop co-founder Drew Carey.

Indeed, several developers took this literally, with multiple teams experimenting with the ethereum virtual machine, the component that compiles smart contracts, on top of bitcoin using the the Rootstock and Counterparty platforms. These technologies allow developers to write smart contract functionality using Solidity, while leveraging the network and enhanced security of bitcoin.

Others like SetOcean developer Bernie Garcia decided to take the plunge into the still-nascent layer two technology, the Lightning Network.

“I wasn’t able to get very far since I had problems with setup. … I had issues with the package documentation but the LND (Lightning Network Daemon) documentation itself is really good,” he explained.

“It’s obviously still very early, there’s still a lot of setup you need to do manually. But it’s looking good and I’m excited to get deeper into it. Next step will be just getting more familiar with the software on testnet, and creating a small network of payment channels with coworkers and family,” he said.

A general consensus

If there was one thing Hackathon participants agreed on besides their ire for the speculative frenzy represented by the nearby conference, it’s the need for sound education to counter it.

“Speculation is killing education,” vented Jesus Najera of SetOcean, a sentiment echoed by Bushido’s Abassi. “Were hitting a bottleneck, there’s all this interest but just not enough people doing actual development,” he explained. “Education is key.”

It’s little surprise then that the first place prize for the Hackathon went to Evan Martinez and his online learning portal, Bitcoin Institute of Technology.

Created from scratch, the homepage promotes learning courses for everyday use, finance and development categories. Due to the Hackathon’s limited time, Martinez chose to focus on the development category, an area of exploding demand in the space. It featured a code editor in the browser where students could write code to pass tests that are integral to learning about how blockchain functions on the software level.

Giving his thoughts on the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem and why he chooses to focus his efforts on bitcoin, Evan explained:

“Bitcoin I think is the purest coin in terms of technology. It aligns the best with my ideals as an open source programmer. It’s simple, and decentralized. It does one thing and it does one thing really well. … I want to help people learn about and understand that.”

While the opinions of developers in the space differ as to how the future may look, there is consensus on one thing. Ignore prices, and don’t succumb to the fear of missing out.

“It’s still incredibly early,” says Douglas. “People just need to take the time to stop and actually learn.”

The Venezuelan government has opened a school in the capital city to teach its citizens how to buy, sell, and mine cryptocurrencies, including courses on the nation’s oil-backed currency, the petro. Meanwhile, President Nicolas Maduro has approved resources for universities across the country to establish mining farms.

Crypto School in Caracas

The Venezuelan government has opened “a training centre to teach its citizens about cryptocurrencies” in its capital city, Caracas, Telesur TV reported on Saturday.

This announcement came shortly after the government announced the launch of its oil-backed currency, the petro. “The cryptocurrency training school offers courses on the petro to Venezuelans for free,” the news outlet added, noting:

At the Granja Laboratorio Petro School in Caracas, Venezuelans can learn how to buy, sell and mine cryptocurrencies and how the cryptoeconomy works.

Carmen Salvador, a Venezuelan teacher of cryptocurrency trading, told Reuters in a video interview Friday that “what we hope to do with this, primarily, is to make knowledge accessible like any new methodology or technology.” The teacher explained that the government is guaranteeing free access for all to participate, noting that these courses often cost most than $500-800 internationally. “Many of our young people here find it impossible to have this amount of resources,” Salvador detailed, emphasizing that “we’ve designed this plan with a completely free training.”

The Minister of Youth and Sports, Pedro Infante, said on the national radio and television network that the mining farm at the school is “made up of several areas such as the Mining Laboratory, where all the necessary equipment is found to mine any type of cryptocurrency on the planet.”

There is a room “created for the study of the trading of cryptocurrencies,” where students will learn about buying, selling, and trading them, as well as how to “diversify the investments that are generated,” he elaborated, emphasizing:

All our technological and computer youth can start a process of training in everything that has to do with the cryptoeconomy, specifically with the petro, the Venezuelan cryptocurrency.

Maduro claimed on Thursday that “his government has raised US$1 billion in the first two days of the petro sale, while its website received almost one million visitors over the same period,” according to Telesur TV. He has also announced the launch of another cryptocurrency backed by gold, called the petro gold. However, some people doubt that Venezuela has raised any money at all from the pre-sale of the petro.

Mining Farms in Universities

Prior to the announcement of the school, Maduro has repeatedly said that he wanted universities across Venezuela to set up mining farms.

The head of state has recently approved resources “for the installation of student mining farms in the country’s universities,” according to the Minister for University Education, Science and Technology, Hugbel Roa. He was quoted saying:

We call on all those technological entrepreneurs that, with the petro, we will finance all these operations in order to grab the necessary technologies and take them to each university and to each school to use mining as a source to break with this rentier model and strengthen the Venezuelan economy.

When a virtual currency company called DateCoin recently tried to entice investors for its initial coin offering, it posted a Facebook ad that featured a reclining woman in a swimsuit with text over her body that read, “Touch my I.C.O.”

And after the North American Bitcoin Conference in January, which highlighted 84 male speakers and three women, the official conference party was held at a Miami strip club.

Virtual currencies and blockchain, the digital ledger that forms the basis of the cryptocurrencies, were intended to be democratizing and equalizing forces, buoyed by a utopian exuberance. But women who have been trying to participate in the gold rush are finding a lopsided gender divide. And some say the culture is getting worse, with the male-dominated culture buoyed by a new fleet of wealthy crypto speculators known as “blockchain bros.”",2018-02-25,https://www.investopedia.com/news/litecoin-cash-forks-investors-look-elsewhere/,"It has been just a few days since the litecoin blockchain was forked, and so far, litecoin cash (LCC) has failed to draw in a following.

After a small spike in price late in the week, at which point litecoin cash climbed above $7 per token, the new cryptocurrency fell to around $3 over the weekend. This means that litecoin cash is just a tiny percentage of the value of the official litecoin project.

A report by Coindesk explores the early days of the new cryptocurrency and attempts to explain why investors have yet to take particular interest in LCC.

Notable Start, Followed By Lackluster Prices

Litecoin cash was initially valued at close to $1.40 and surged nearly six-fold to a high of $9.25 on Feb. 20, shortly after it launched. Even by the extreme volatility that is a hallmark of the cryptocurrency space, it was an impressive start for the new token.

Litecoin itself also benefited from the fork and the quick gains for LCC, as litecoin's value climbed while investors secured their holdings on the fifth-most valuable digital currency in the world in an effort to secure more litecoin cash at the time of the fork.

Following this impressive beginning, though, LCC has sputtered. Perhaps one reason is the seamless forking experience. In other high-profile forks, such as those for bitcoin, there has been dramatic and prolonged discussion among different factions in the debate. This has served, among other things, to publicize the proceedings and make the crypto investment community aware of the fork itself.

Litecoin's fork went very smoothly in comparison, with relatively little discussion. As a result, it's possible that many investors were simply unaware of the fork and the generation of litecoin cash in the first place.

Exchanges Sluggish to Adopt

Another possible reason why litecoin cash has been slow to catch on is that no major exchange has yet announced its support for the new token. Early on, LCC was listed only on YoBit. The litecoin cash website indicated the availability of LCC on exchanges like Trade Satoshi and Mercatox before either of those exchanges actually offered the new token. (See also: What Is Litecoin And How Does It Work?)

Finally, the name of the project may also be a drawback. Litecoin's creator, Charlie Lee, even spoke out about the decision to call the token ""litecoin cash,"" saying that it was reminiscent of the polarizing bitcoin cash fork.

Like most sixth graders, Andrew Courey is usually playing sports and toying with his iPhone when he's not in school. But unlike most other 11-year olds, he's also an expert on bitcoin. Courey is the author of ""Early Bird Gets The Bitcoin: The Ultimate Guide To Everything About Bitcoin,"" which he self-published for the Amazon Kindle in January. The e-book sells for $2.99, and the paper copy, just released, costs $9.99. The son of a tech investor, Courey loves math, enjoys tinkering with mobile apps and frequently comes up with business ideas. At one of his recent basketball games, upset with a foul call, he walked over to his dad on the sidelines and suggested creating the ""Glassdoor for referees"" — a website for grading officials. Last year, he was looking for investment opportunities as part of an ambitious plan to earn $20 million by the age of 14, which would enable him to drop out of school, according to an agreement with his parents. Courey came across bitcoin and began reading stories and watching YouTube videos about miners and early investors who had made a lot of money from the digital currency.

Given the run-up in prices last year, when bitcoin surged almost 17-fold, Courey wasn't sold on the currency as an investment. But knowing that his son was looking for sources of ""passive income,"" Jeff Courey, Andrew's dad, convinced him to write and sell a book that could put all his research to good use and simplify the many complex ideas around bitcoin and blockchain. ""Anyone can learn about cryptocurrencies if they're willing to spend 70 to 80 hours researching every source until they find a couple sources that make sense,"" said Andrew, who lives with his parents and younger sister in Wellesley, Massachusetts.

The title has two meanings, with early bird serving as a reference both to kids, for whom the book is written, and the idea that the people who got into bitcoin early made fortunes.

A wallet is like a mailbox

One of Courey's main objectives with the book was to find real-world analogies to bitcoin and blockchain so that complete novices (kids) can grasp these foreign and very complicated concepts. For example, he compares the distributed ledger technology blockchain to a Google Docs file ""shared with everyone that can only be edited by buying or selling bitcoin."" In describing a bitcoin wallet, where currency is stored, Courey writes that there's a public key that's available to anyone and a private key that only the owner can access. Here's the analogy: ""Imagine there is a mailbox — the mailman can drive the mail to any mailbox, but only the person with the key can access the mail."" Courey concludes each chapter with a ""fun fact"" related to the topic. At the end of the chapter on bitcoin mining, he writes that the current power consumption required for mining ""is estimated to be more than that of 159 countries.""",2018-02-25,https://news.bitcoin.com/canadian-banks-allow-cryptocurrency-credit-card-transactions/,"Some Major Canadian Banks Still Allow Cryptocurrency Credit Card Transactions

While TD Bank has revised its policies and stopped allowing customers to purchase cryptocurrencies using its credit cards, some major banks in Canada still allow crypto credit card transactions, the banks reportedly confirmed on Friday.

Also read: Indians Look to Buy Bitcoin Overseas as Regulations Tighten

TD Bank Halts Crypto Credit Card Purchases

Canada’s largest bank by assets as of April of last year, Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank), said on Friday that it is “halting the use of its credit cards to buy cryptocurrency as it conducts a review of the ‘evolving market’,” Financial Post reported. The bank explained in an emailed statement:

At TD, we regularly evaluate our policies and security measures, in order to serve and protect our customers, as well as the bank.

TD Bank’s Friday announcement reverses its stance earlier this month when the bank said it permitted cryptocurrency purchases using credit and debit cards “as long as the merchant is authorized to accept Visa, Mastercard, Interac or Visa debit and the transaction isn’t determined to be fraudulent,” according to the bank’s spokeswoman Julie Bellissimo.

Some Banks Still Allow Crypto Credit Card Purchases

Some banks in Canada, however, still allow their customers to buy cryptocurrencies using their credit cards currently.

Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the country’s second-largest bank by assets, said on Friday that “it does allow its credit and debit cards to be used for transactions involving cryptocurrency in limited circumstances,” Financial Post noted. Nonetheless, the bank cautioned clients about the volatility of cryptocurrencies which “could expose them to substantially higher debt levels than they are able to repay.” An RBC spokesperson said in an emailed statement:

We do recognize that regulatory, risk and other external environmental factors relating to cryptocurrency continues to evolve…As such, we continue to review our policies to consider how we can best support clients.

The Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), the third largest bank in Canada by asset, is also looking closely at its cryptocurrency transaction policy, the news outlet added. The bank’s spokesperson said in an emailed statement, “We understand that regulatory and risk factors related to cryptocurrency continue to evolve and as a result, we are closely reviewing our policies with respect to cryptocurrency transactions.” At the time of this writing, the bank has not announced any changes in its policies.

Additionally, the National Bank of Canada, the country’s sixth-largest lender, said earlier this month that it allows crypto transactions, the publication further noted.

A Global Trend

Globally, an increasing number of banks are halting the use of their credit cards for cryptocurrency transactions. In the US, JP Morgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup have stopped allowing customers to use their credit cards to purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

In the UK, Britain’s largest banking group, Lloyds Banking Group, has banned its customers from using credit cards from any of its subsidiaries to buy cryptocurrencies including Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax, and MBNA.

In Australia, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) announced last week that it would no longer allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies with credit cards. “We have made this decision because we believe virtual currencies do not meet a minimum standard of regulation, reliability, and reputation when compared to currencies that we offer to our customers,” the bank explained.

In Asia, Thailand has asked all commercial banks in the country to disallow cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards. In India, while SBI is allowing the use of its credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies for the time being, Citibank has banned the use of its debit and credit cards for crypto purchases.

A single asset class gained more than 3,300% in market cap (almost $600 billion) over a span of just 12 months. It's essentially a lifetime's worth of gains for some investors that were crammed into only one year.

Of course, 2018 hasn't had nearly the same flair as 2017. After beginning January on a high note, cryptocurrencies fell off a cliff, losing 67% of their market cap, from peak to trough, between Jan. 7 and Feb. 6. Everything from the prospect of increased regulations in South Korea to Facebook banning cryptocurrency advertisements hit the market hard.

Then again, some aggressive investors saw the drop as a buying opportunity. In the two weeks following Feb. 6, digital currency valuations again doubled. This whipsaw action has become commonplace for a market that's predominantly driven by emotionally charged retail investors.

Take note: These virtual currencies could still double

Yet even with a plethora of risks and the volatility, a handful of virtual currencies continue to stand out thanks to their proprietary blockchain technology -- the digital, distributed, and decentralized ledger that's responsible for logging all transactions. While guessing the next move in virtual currencies has proved to be more of a crapshoot than Wall Street typically prefers, the following three cryptocurrencies may have a genuine shot at doubling from their current market caps.

1. Ethereum

Feel free to call me nuts, but I believe the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has the potential to double and/or surpass bitcoin in total value. In fact, I've been of the opinion for quite some time that Ethereum deserves to be the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world, by market cap.

Ethereum's selling points are its blockchain and enterprise clients. Its blockchain has three very distinct differences from bitcoin that should allow it to close the market-cap gap with the world's largest cryptocurrency. First, Ethereum can process almost three times as many transactions per second as bitcoin can. Not only are these transactions processed more quickly, but they're considerably cheaper, with the average transaction on the Ethereum network costing less than $1, and the average bitcoin transaction cost pushing north of $28.

Secondly, Ethereum's blockchain transcends currency-only applications. It not only has the potential to transform how financial institutions transmit money, but it can be pivotal in helping monitor supply chains, creating digital identifications, and logging medical records, to name a few ideas. Not surprisingly, 200 organizations from around the globe are currently testing a version of Ethereum's blockchain, via the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, from a multitude of different sectors.

Third, Ethereum's smart contract protocols are a game changer. Smart contracts aid in the verification, facilitation, and enforcement of a contract. In other words, they're the rules that make digital contracts binding, at least relative to murkier paper contracts. Smart contracts can be also be molded to fit the needs of a business, making them perfect for a host of industries and sectors.

While bitcoin struggles with slow processing times, high transaction fees, and is stuck with currency-only applications, Ethereum's network is scratching the tip of the iceberg.

2. Nano

If you want a true cryptocurrency wildcard, it would be Nano (formerly known as RaiBlocks). Nano brings an extremely unique blockchain design into the mix, as well as some groundbreaking processing speeds that could turn heads.

Rather than relying on a single central blockchain, which with an open-source network often means needing to reach a massive amount of people to achieve consensus anytime something big is about to happen with the network (e.g., a software or hardware upgrade), Nano sports a block-lattice blockchain. In other words, each user has their very own blockchain that they can control, meaning there's no large consensus that needs to be reached... ever. Because each account has its own blockchain, the network should, in theory, be rapidly scalable without impacting performance.

How fast is the Nano network, you ask? According to the horse's mouth, Nano is capable of processing an incredible 7,000 transactions per second, albeit hardware upgrades in the near to intermediate future are expected to push this figure even higher. Relatively speaking, Visa can process in the neighborhood of 24,000 transactions per second, meaning Nano is closer than any other cryptocurrency at present to the payment processing kingpin. By comparison, bitcoin maxes out at a mere seven transactions per second.

It is worth pointing out that because of the setup of Nano's blockchain, it requires a peer-to-peer payment to be broken down into two separate transactions: one where the sender removes money from their account, and another where the receiver adds the funds to his or her account. It may sound cumbersome, but it's lightning-fast and, perhaps best of all, free.

The downside? Nano doesn't have any major partners as of yet. However, with these processing speeds, it's just a matter of time.

3. Qtum

A final virtual currency with the potential to double in value from its current levels is Qtum. Qtum's blockchain was developed with the idea of taking the best aspects of bitcoin's infrastructure and Ethereum's Virtual Machine, then tweaking it with proprietary additions. This created a blockchain that incorporates smart contract protocols and, despite future updates, will remain compatible with bitcoin gateways and existing Ethereum smart contracts.

In January, the Qtum Foundation noted that it would be announcing five major partnerships in 2018. Two of those partnerships were announced in January, just a day apart. The first involved 360 Finance, a subsidiary of Qihoo 360, a Chinese cybersecurity company that was taken private in 2016. Qihoo 360 is also the parent behind 360 Browser and the 360 Search engine in China, which currently ranks third in search market share. This partnership with 360 Finance creates a blockchain laboratory where, along with BTN Foundation, all three will put their heads together to develop cutting-edge blockchain solutions.

The very next day, Qtum announced that it was partnering with Baofeng Bokocloud to achieve the world's first blockchain consensus network service. Baofeng's media player is a video and streaming service in China with more than 200 million users, and it's believed the company will use Qtum's blockchain for payments made to the company, as well as copyright protections.

What's far more exciting is what Baofeng is doing for Qtum's blockchain. Utilizing its Bokocloud service, Baofeng plans to increase Qtum's network to over 50,000 full nodes, pushing it well beyond the scalable potential of bitcoin, and even Ethereum. Under the right conditions, Qtum could flourish.",2018-02-25,https://qz.com/1214423/revolut-breaks-even-after-partnering-with-bitstamp-for-crypto-trading/,"Revolut, a financial technology firm based in London, broke even in December for the first time after it launched a service for converting and holding cryptocurrencies. The company says it added 500,000 customers in the past two months, bringing the total to 1.5 million.

The nearly three-year-old firm began offering bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin in early December, partnering with crypto exchange Bitstamp for the service. Revolut said it’s also growing because of new products like geolocation travel insurance and because it now has teams on the ground in France, Germany, Spain, and Scandinavia. It has 350,000 daily active users and more than 800,000 monthly active users. (Six months ago, those figures were 100,000 and 600,000, respectively.)

Revolut CEO Nikolay Storonsky said in a statement that expansion, rather than profitability, is the goal right now. And while the company says the uptick in business wasn’t solely related to its new crypto offering, recent trends suggest that adding bitcoin to the mix can win over a bunch of new customers. Robinhood’s user base jumped to 4 million this month, up 1 million since November, after the brokerage app rolled out trading for digital assets.

There are risks. As Revolut’s disclosures point out, crypto is prone to wild price swings, and “exchanges are probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles.” Merrill Lynch barred its customers, and the financial advisers who make transactions for them, from buying bitcoin.

Keeping digital assets like bitcoin safe from hackers has also proven a challenge. Bitstamp, which has offices in London, Luxembourg, and New York, is one of the largest exchanges for digital assets, and its pricing data is used in the bitcoin index run by CME Group, a global derivatives exchange. Even so, Bitstamp was hacked in 2015 and $5 million worth of bitcoins were stolen.

Revolut says its customers’ cryptocurrency is held offline, known as cold storage, to keep hackers from breaking in. The company declined to disclose more information about its storage system, citing security reasons.

Europe has a number of upstarts that offer digital-only financial services. Others include Starling and Monzo, both of which have headquarters in London, and Berlin-based N26. As of January, Monzo said 500,000 people are using its app-only service, and 400,000 are now using its checking account.

It’s still early days for these fast-growing firms. For context, Royal Bank of Scotland has more than 18 million customers around the world. For its part, Revolut says it’s signing up as many as 8,000 new customers each day and is preparing to expand in the US, Australia, and Singapore, with talks underway from India to South Africa. The coming months will offer clues to whether these challengers with whizzy apps, bargains on foreign-exchange, and crypto trading services can become serious competitors for the big, established players.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-cryptocurrency-debit-card-harnesses-ai-to-give-customers-the-best-deal,"The increasing ability to pay for products and services using cryptocurrency debit cards is a physical representation of the rise in crypto popularity. However, they are still relatively rare and at times complex; with so many cryptocurrencies available in conjunction with market volatility, it can be difficult for traders to know how best to utilize the contents of their cryptowallets when making purchases.

Amon is a financial cryptocurrency platform that looks to solve this issue using their unique payment card which utilises artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure that users get the best value from their cryptowallets with every purchase. Their whitepaper claims that they are the only platform which enables users to use their most valuable cryptocurrencies for purchases in real time. Amon also offers their own unique Amon tokens (AMN).

Three purchase methods

Amon card holders will have three purchase methods to choose from. The simplest is to instruct the wallet to allows pay with a single currency (for example, someone who is only interested in Bitcoin). The second is to personally select which of your currencies to use after swiping the Amon card. The third brings into play the unique Amon Artificial Intelligence Aystem (AAIS) which will select the best currency to use in real-time on a per transaction basis.

Amon’s whitepaper uses the scenario of buying a coffee using the Amon card as an example. The AAIS algorithm will analyze the user’s cryptowallet and decide the current best performing cryptocurrency, taking into account factors such as historical data and user risk profile. The algorithm displays to the user the crypto with the highest value to them at that point. The user can then decide to accept the suggestion or pick another currency to purchase the coffee with.

Partnership and tokens sale

When it comes to security, traders can be assured by Amon’s partnership with established cloud platforming company Ixonn and audits by Econocom Group. Amon has also partnered with Daneel, which runs webcrawls to assist traders in investment decision, and CognitionBox, a trading algorithm company helping to develop AAIS.

Amon also claims that they are set apart from the competition by their 24/7 ‘premium’ customer service; something that they claim is sadly lacking in the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.

The Amon private ICO will begin on March 1 2018 for 24 hours (1 AMN = $0.05), but in order for traders to take part they must subscribe to the whitelist by Feb. 28. Joining the whitelist will also give traders a 25 percent AMN token bonus, and a free Amon Gold Card . The first public ICO will follow on March 4, where the token bonus will be reduced to 15 percent.

Looking further ahead, Amon are looking to release the Amon wallet to the public in Q2 2018, followed by obtaining an e-money license and wallet decentralisation in Q3. Their aims for market share are to have 3 percent, 5 percent or 7 percent (negative, realistic or positive estimates respectively) control during the first year.

The team behind Amon are diverse in background and experience. Amon’s four co-founders are from Italy and Australia, and also have team members from France, Spain, Ukraine, and the US. CEO Daniele Izzo previously co-founded another platform for the legal marketplace, AvvocatoFlash, with two of Amon’s other Italian founders, Valerio Sudrio (CMO) and Cristian Izzo (CTO). AvvocatoFlash has thrived in the Italian marketplace, with over 5000 lawyers involved and more than 20,000 legal cases dealt with per year.

Payment company Circle has announced that it has purchased Poloniex cryptocurrency exchange. Rumors of the acquisition had been circulating for weeks, and were finally confirmed today in press releases issued by both parties. Poloniex is one of the most well established cryptocurrency exchanges, but has been stagnating. It is hoped that the partnership will revitalize its fortunes while bolstering Circle’s presence in the crypto market.

Poloniex Goes Full Circle

When the story of Circle purchasing Poloniex surfaced on an obscure site called Modern Consensus, it was shot down as fake news. It turns out, the story was accurate and the news was very real. “Circle and Poloniex Accelerate the Emerging Token Economy” reads the headline of the press release Circle issued on February 26 at 8am NYT. Circle is already invested in crypto via its Circle Trade app, but Poloniex connects it to a main artery at the heart of the crypto ecosystem.

There’s a lot of talk of tokens in Circle’s press release, including the phrase “an open global token marketplace”. It’s evident that Circle has big plans for Poloniex and will be taking a hand-on approach as it seeks to enact its vision for the soon-to-be-revitalized exchange. These plans clearly extend beyond disabling the trollbox that was one of Poloniex’s defining features. Circle talks of improving “customer experience” – something Polo is notoriously bad for – as well as “risk, compliance, and technical operations”.

Old Exchange Meets New Money

In crypto terms, Poloniex is an OG, having been around since 2014. It’s managed to avoid succumbing to any major hacks in that time, which is an achievement in its own right. “Any updates we make in the course of this transition will be behind-the-scenes and focused on strengthening user experience, platform performance, and security,” explains Poloniex. “Your funds will remain safe and access to account functionality uninterrupted throughout.” The press release finishes by speaking of exploring “options for fiat connectivity across major world currencies, and…access to innovative token projects that extend cryptocurrency protocols to new use cases.”

In the last year or so, exchanges such as Bittrex and Poloniex have largely been eclipsed by newer entrants such as Binance and Kucoin. The former pair have failed to innovate, and traders have been forced to take their business to exchanges willing to list the latest tokens and cryptocurrencies. Poloniex still carries great weight however, and is the 14th largest cryptocurrency exchange based on trading volume. In the last 24 hours, $139 million was traded on the U.S. exchange, with bitcoin and litecoin accounting for 37% of the volume. With Circle now pulling the strings, there is every likelihood of Poloniex re-establishing itself as dominant global exchange.

Neither of the Boston-based companies disclosed the value of the deal that gives Circle control of a marketplace it said sometimes has daily volumes of more than $2 billion, with around 70 different digital currencies and tokens traded.

Fortune magazine said the deal was worth $400 million, citing a person familiar with the matter.

“We’ve been really impressed with what they have been able to pull off,” Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said.

“They defined what originally people thought of as ‘altcoin’ exchanges,” he told Reuters. The term altcoin describes newer cryptocurrencies than the more established bitcoin and ether.

Circle operates an app-based peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin. It is also one of the leading players in the over-the-counter market for bitcoin trading, and is soon launching a retail-focused app for buying cryptocurrencies, Circle Invest.

One of the best-funded blockchain startups, its investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Baidu Inc.

Circle’s founders said they had discussed the acquisition with all of their investors, as well as with regulators, and that the deal was closed on Friday.

The value of cryptocurrencies - as well as the number - has ballooned since the start of 2017, when they were worth around $17 billion, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, with their total value topping $800 billion in January before slipping to around $450 billion now.

There are now more than 1,500 digital currencies and tokens, Coinmarketcap said.

REGULATORY SCRUTINY

Poloniex is well-known among cryptocurrency investors because it offers trading on a wide range of digital coins, several of which have been issued through online fundraisers known as “initial coin offerings” (ICOs).

Regulators across the world have been intensifying their scrutiny of ICOs and cryptocurrency exchanges.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July warned that some of the coins issued in ICOs could be considered securities, meaning trading them would have to comply with federal securities laws.

“We intend to continue playing a leadership role when it comes to national and global regulatory frameworks for this space,” Circle co-founder Sean Neville told Reuters.

“That includes meeting with the SEC as well as obtaining all relevant licensing required for us to support our customers.”

Regulators are also keeping an eye on the anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) practices of cryptocurrency exchanges.

A Reuters investigation published in September showed that Poloniex had allowed some customers to trade cryptocurrencies and withdraw up to $2,000 worth of digital coins a day by providing only a name, an email address and a country.

Allaire said Poloniex had instituted full KYC checks for new customers, but he could not confirm the exchange had the identities of all existing clients.

“I’m not sure that 100 percent of prior clients have gone through all their identity verification requests. I know they have a huge backlog of clients in their KYC queues,” he said.

“But obviously now that we operate the company we’re going to ensure that the business is compliant in every way it needs to be.”

The exchange is not allowed to accept New York residents because it lacks a state license to operate a cryptocurrency exchange, but the Reuters investigation found two New York residents who had claimed that they lived elsewhere and were able to trade on Poloniex.

“Clearly, people can get around things like IP (internet protocol) restrictions, and other restrictions, and people do it all the time. People evade geo-blocking mechanisms, and it’s difficult to fully police. So it’s possible that some people have snuck through that, and that’s obviously something we take very seriously,” Allaire said.

Circle said that in the coming years, it expected to grow the Poloniex exchange out to include other non-crypto assets, such as physical goods and financial products such as derivatives.

“We look forward to bringing Circle’s experience to increase the scalability and reliability of our platform and operations,” Poloniex said in a statement on its website.",2018-02-26 13:39:31+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/circle-acquires-poloniex,"Circle announced Monday that it has acquired the U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, confirming recent rumours about the deal.

In a statement, Poloniex said that its team would be bolstered by the operational and customer support resources from Circle “so that we can continue to scale effectively going forward.”

“We recognize that our extraordinary growth these past few years has not come without some growing pains for our users. We look forward to bringing Circle’s experience to increase the scalability and reliability of our platform and operations.”

Rumors about the acquisition had been in the air for weeks prior to Monday’s announcement. On Feb. 2, a report on the Modern Consensus said that Circle “is deep in discussions to acquire Poloniex.” Fortune’s Robert Hackett reported today that, according to a source with knowledge of the deal, Circle paid roughly $400 million to buy out Poloniex, which launched in 2014.

Commenting on the deal, Circle said that it plans to build on the work done previously by the Poloniex team, setting the goal of pushing it past being “an exchange for only crypto assets.”

“We envision a robust multi-sided distributed marketplace that can host tokens which represent everything of value: physical goods, fundraising and equity, real estate, creative productions such as works of art, music and literature, service leases and time-based rentals, credit, futures, and more,” co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote.

In its own statements, Poloniex stressed that its users would see no disruption of services during the transition, writing that “any updates we make in the course of this transition will be behind-the-scenes and focused on strengthening user experience, platform performance, and security.

“Your funds will remain safe and access to account functionality uninterrupted throughout,” the exchange added.

In a Friday court document obtained by The Blast, the rapper admits that he has never owned bitcoin, and only went along with the initial report from TMZ because “so long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand, I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting.”

He added, “This is particularly true when I feel the press report in question is favorable to my image or brand.” It did make 50 Cent initially look like a baller when, at the height of bitcoin’s value, he appeared to be $8 million deep in cryptocurrency. But, to prove that he is bankrupt, he ultimately had to reveal that he does not own any bitcoin. It’s unclear whether 50 Cent is lying to bankruptcy court or earlier on social media. His reps did not immediately respond to comment.

50 Cent admitted in the bankruptcy documents that recent media reports have “falsely stated” that he made $8 million in bitcoin (none of which he had disclosed to the bankruptcy court). In reality, he says, he has never owned any bitcoin “from 2014 to the present.” The 700 bitcoins he reportedly earned from album sales were converted to US dollars by a third party before 50 Cent or his affiliated companies could receive it.

Previously, 50 Cent bragged about his sudden bitcoin “wealth” on Instagram and Twitter posts, posting “Not bad for a kid from South Side, I’m so proud of me” and “A little bitcoin anyone? LOL. l know l make you sick but excuse me...I’m getting to the bag.” Perhaps his Instagram reply to his fans was a little more honest, or at least hinting at the truth: “Ima keep it real, I forgot I did that shit lol.”",2018-02-26,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/02/26/bitcoin-move-over-theres-a-new-cryptocurrency-in-town-the-petro/,"The currency is one of many sold as tokens on the New Economy Movement platform, a technology that supports cryptocurrencies. The New Economy Movement blockchain confirmed on its Twitter account that it was the platform that the Venezuelan government had selected for the petro, while also adding that it does not make political endorsements.

AD

Unlike Venezuela’s official currency, the bolivar, the petro exists online only and is not regulated by the central bank. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, the petro is controlled by a government, although it is not clear which specific government entity is responsible for issuing the currency. The minister of science, technology and university education was by Maduro’s side at the launch, suggesting that the petro might fall under his jurisdiction.

The United States prohibits Americans from buying and selling petros, arguing that Venezuela is using them to skirt tough sanctions. That’s probably true. Here is what you need to know about this cryptocurrency.

1. Venezuela is sort of rich

AD

Venezuela’s riches have always been underground. The country sits atop the world’s largest proved oil reserves, estimated at 300 billion barrels of crude. Since the oil was discovered in 1914, the country has sought ways to translate “rich in oil” into just plain rich. Beginning in the mid-1970s, a series of Venezuelan governments approached this in more or less the same way: have a state-owned oil company extract the oil and sell it abroad, distribute some of the money to citizens and keep the rest. However, Maduro has mismanaged the national oil company, and world oil prices have plummeted — leading Venezuela into its current crisis.

AD

2. But it’s not very rich right now

Venezuela is deeply in the red. In all, the country owes foreign creditors about $60 billion. The country has just under $10 billion in foreign reserves, the lowest level the country has seen in at least two decades. Maduro surprised analysts by making a few debt payments last year, though Venezuela eventually defaulted in November. Venezuela’s next debt payment of $753 million is due in August. The majority of Venezuelan citizens go to bed hungry; many are starving and living without necessary medicine and health care, leading to riots and mass emigration.

3. The petro is not a new bitcoin but a new way to get money from oil

AD

The petro is officially the first cryptocurrency backed by a country. Until now, one of the things that made cryptocurrencies distinct from regular currencies was that none have been the official currency of any country, backed by any one economy or controlled by a central bank.

AD

The petro is almost all of the above. So why invent a new national currency? Under Maduro, oil production in Venezuela has fallen to just around 2 million barrels per day and is unlikely to recover soon. The government has tried — and failed at — other strategies to raise revenue, such as selling oil assets to Russia. As Maduro has consolidated power in autocratic ways, including stripping the National Assembly of its powers, the United States cut off Maduro’s access to credit markets last August. That made it even more difficult for the government to bring in the cash it desperately needs to stay in power.

Selling petro tokens that are backed by the crude is a way to get money from oil without having to put in the effort to extract it. The oil fields that are being flaunted as backing the petro have a recovery rate of only about 6 to 8 percent — meaning that existing technology only allows for the extraction of a small portion of the underground reserves — and would be expensive to develop. Selling cryptocurrency that is supposedly backed by these resources is a quick way to convert this into much needed foreign exchange.

AD

While Maduro claims that these tokens are backed by oil reserves, Venezuela’s constitution says that oil belongs to the public domain. As an “inalienable and imprescriptible” resource, it cannot be used as collateral.

4. Earnings from the petro won’t do most Venezuelans any good

AD

Everyone in Venezuela needs foreign exchange. The regime needs it to stay in power and Venezuelans need it to buy food and medicine, which can no longer be purchased with the nearly worthless bolivar. The country is facing a dramatic food and medicine shortage. Many countries, including the United States, have offered to send emergency humanitarian aid, including food and medicine. But the Venezuelan government insists that there is no emergency, and has refused to allow humanitarian aid to enter the country. Given this refusal to acknowledge the very real crisis, the government is unlikely to use petro revenue to help citizens in a meaningful way.

AD

The petro tokens can be purchased only with U.S. dollars. Venezuela’s exchange rate controls severely limit the amount of foreign currency that Venezuelans can buy. Tellingly, a commenter on the cryptocurrency’s website wrote in Spanish, “How can I buy the tokens with bolivares [the official Venezuelan currency] since us Venezuelans don’t have access to dollars?”

On its first day of trading the petro raised $375 million. At $60 a token, that means that in one day Venezuela sold the virtual equivalent of 6.25 million barrels of oil, double what the country was producing at its peak in the late 1990s. There is still plenty of uncertainty about the petro, including what “backed by oil reserves” would mean in practice.

But here’s what’s clear: Maduro might be the first autocrat to receive rents from oil without actually having to produce any of it.",2018-02-26,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/26/steve-wozniak-says-someone-stole-seven-bitcoins-from-him.html,"Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak had some bitcoins stolen from him, The Economic Times in India reported Monday.

""I had seven bitcoins stolen from me through fraud,"" Wozniak said at the Times' Global Business Summit. ""Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card and they cancelled the credit card payment. It was that easy. And it was from a stolen credit card number so you can never get it back.""

At today's price of around $10,200 a bitcoin, Wozniak's stolen cryptocurrency are worth roughly $71,400.

Bitcoin is up several hundred percent from less than $1,000 early last year. It is the first application of blockchain technology, which eliminates the need for a third party such as a bank by creating a near-instant, permanent and secure record of transactions.

The American inventor remains a supporter of the cryptocurrency, which he initially bought at $700 each as an experiment, according to The Times.",2018-02-26,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-latest-cryptocurrency-investors-noobs-litecoin-rollercoaster-ride-volatile-price-a8228811.html,"After researching digital currencies for work last year, personal finance writer J.R. Duren hopped on his own crypto-rollercoaster.

Duren bought $5 worth of litecoin in November, and eventually purchased $400 more, mostly with his credit card. In just a few months, he experienced a rally, a crash and a recovery, with the adrenaline highs and lows that come along.

“At first, I was freaking out,” Duren said about watching his portfolio plunge 40 per cent at one point. “The precipitous drop came as a shock.”

The 39-year-old Floridian is part of the new class of crypto-investors who do not necessarily think bitcoin will replace the US dollar, or that blockchain will revolutionise modern finance or that dentists should have their own currency.

Dubbed by longtime crypto-investors as ""the noobs"" online lingo for ""newbies"" they are ordinary investors hopping onto the latest trend, often with little understanding of how cryptocurrencies work or why they exist.

“There has been a big shift in the type of investors we have seen in crypto over the past year,” said Angela Walch, a fellow at the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies. “It's shifted from a small group of techies to average Joes. I overhear conversations about cryptocurrencies everywhere, in coffee shops and airports.”

Walch and other experts cited parallels to the late-1990s, when retail investors jumped into stocks like Pets.com, a short-lived online seller of pet supplies, only to watch their wealth evaporate when the dot-com bubble burst.

Bitcoin is the best-known virtual currency but there are now more than 1,500 to choose from, according to market data website CoinMarketCap, ranging from popular coins like ether and ripple to obscure coins like dentacoin, the one intended for dentists.

Exactly how many “noobs” bought into the craze last year is unclear because each transaction is pseudonymous, meaning it is linked to a unique digital address, and few exchanges collect or share detailed information about their users.

A variety of consumer-friendly websites have made investing much easier, and online forums are now filled with posts from ordinary retail investors who were rarely spotted on the cryptocurrency pages of social news hub Reddit before.

Reuters interviewed eight people who recently made their first foray into digital currency investing. Many were motivated by a fear of missing out on profits during what seemed like a never-ending rally last year.

One bitcoin was worth almost $20,000 in December, up around 1,900 percent from the start of 2017. As of Friday afternoon it was worth about $10,000 after having fallen as much as 70 per cent from its peak. Other coins made even bigger gains and experienced equally dizzying drops over that time frame.

“There was that two-month period last year where all the virtual currencies kept going and up and I had a couple of friends that had invested and they had made five-figure returns,” said Michael Brown, a research analyst in New Jersey, who said he bought around $1,000 worth of ether in December.

“I got swept by the media frenzy,” he said. “You never hear stories of people losing money.”

In the weeks after Brown invested, his holdings soared as much as 75 per cent and tumbled as much as 59 per cent.

Investors who got into bitcoin before its 2013 crash like to refer to themselves as “OGs,” short for “original gangsters.” They tend to shrug off the recent downturn, arguing that cryptocurrencies will be worth much more in the future.

“As crashes go, this is one of the biggest,” said Xavier Levenfiche, who first invested in cryptocurrencies in 2011. “But, in the grand scheme of things, it's a hiccup on the road to greatness.”

Spooked by the sudden fall but not willing to book a loss, many investors are embracing a mantra known as “HODL.” The term stems from a misspelled post on an online forum during the cryptocurrency crash in 2013, when a user wrote he was “hodling” his bitcoin, instead of “holding.”

Mike Gnitecki, for instance, bought one bitcoin at around $18,000 in December and was sitting on a 43 per cent decline as of Friday, waiting for a recovery.

“I view it as having been a fun side investment similar to a gamble,” said Gnitecki, a paramedic from Texas. “Clearly I lost some money on this particular gamble.”

Duren, the personal finance writer, is also holding onto his litecoin for now, though he regrets having spent $33 on credit card and exchange fees for a $405 investment.

Some retail investors who went big into cryptocurrencies for the first time during the rally last year remain positive.

Didi Taihuttu announced in October that he and his family had sold everything they owned - including their business, home, cars and toys - to move to a “digital nomad” camp in Thailand.

In an interview, Taihuttu said he has no regrets. The crypto-day-trader's portfolio is in the black, and he predicts one bitcoin will be worth between $30,000 and $50,000 by year-end.

""We see cryptocurrencies potentially becoming more widely used in the future as the markets mature. Yet for now we believe they should only be considered by those who can stomach potentially complete losses,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, said in the note.

Turnill noted cryptocurrencies' high volatility, fragmented markets and lack of regulation. ""We don't see them becoming part of mainstream investment portfolios soon,"" he said, adding that their volatility makes U.S. stock market turbulence during the financial crisis ""almost look placid.""

Cryptocurrencies also haven't been able to protect investors from sharp drops in stocks. That's despite arguments for investing in the digital assets given their low correlations to traditional assets.

The digital currencies had ""no ability to mitigate portfolio drawdown during periods of acute market stress like equity flash crashes of August 2015 and February 2018,"" J.P. Morgan Securities' John Normand said in a Feb. 9 report.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, leaped 2,000 percent to above $19,000 in the 12 months through mid-December. The surge of interest spurred the world's largest futures exchange, CME, and its competitor, Cboe, to launch bitcoin futures in December as well.

Enthusiasts expected the derivatives products would pave the way for more institutional investor participation and even the launch of bitcoin exchange-traded funds later this year.

However, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has asked companies to withdraw their applications for bitcoin ETFs. Trading volume in the CME and Cboe bitcoin futures also remains relatively low compared with other, more widely traded products.

Bitcoin has lost about half its value in just about two months and was trading near $10,000 Monday.

BlackRock's Turnill expects cryptocurrencies will need to overcome significant challenges in order to gain wider appeal.

He noted the blockchain technology underlying cryptocurrencies would require a ""massive shift"" in software development for broad adoption. Regulators would likely need to play a major role in such a shift, Turnill said. He does expect a global regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies to emerge, potentially from a G-20 meeting set for March.

First, he forgot about owning millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin. Then he bragged about it. Now, 50 Cent, who is filing for bankruptcy, says he never owned any of the digital currency after all.

As NPR's Bill Chappell reported last month, the rapper, whose given name is Curtis Jackson, acknowledged in a 2014 Reddit discussion that he had accepted bitcoin in partial payment for his Animal Ambition album. A TMZ report subsequently reported an estimate of the amount he received was about 700 bitcoins.

At the time, individual units of the volatile cryptocurrency would have been worth a few hundred dollars each, but today, bitcoin is valued at around $10,000.

In a (since deleted) Instagram post in January, the rapper bragged about his discovered windfall, saying he ""forgot"" that he had owned it.

However, in a bankruptcy filing late last week, lawyers for the artist told the court that the recent media reports ""falsely stated"" that he owned any bitcoin at all.

""[The] Debtor has never owned, and does not now own, a bitcoin account or any bitcoins, and to the best of his knowledge, none of his companies had a bitcoin account from 2014 to present,"" the court papers said.

The documents state that he did receive some of the currency, but that a third party company handled the transaction and that it was converted immediately into U.S. dollars.

As Coindesk reports, the filing suggests that the number of bitcoin received for the album was far fewer than the 700 reported by TMZ. Based on printouts included in the court papers, TechCrunch estimates that 50 Cent may have received only about six or seven bitcoins in 2014.

As part of the filing, the artist himself claimed that he did not dispute the TMZ report because, ""As a general matter, so long as a press story is not irreparably damaging to my image or brand, I usually do not feel the need to publicly deny the reporting.""

""This is particularly true when I feel the press report in question is favorable to my image or brand, even if that report is based on a misunderstanding of the facts or contains outright falsehoods,"" he said.

It has even led to the development of malware designed to hijack computer processing power for mining. But how does Bitcoin mining work?

Editor's Pick What is cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency has been a hot topic of debate among businesses, government, and the general public for a while now. It’s similar to currencies like dollars and euros in that it holds value and allows you …

Bitcoin miners are rewarded for processing transactions and updating the blockchain

The mighty blockchain

Much like the gold rush, mining represents the opportunity for participants to be rewarded with a shiny new commodity. It’s not free, in the sense that you’ll need some powerful hardware and a way to pay the hefty electricity bills, but bitcoin mining is a way to obtain some cryptocurrency without having to buy it on the market. Miners don’t really do any digging for bitcoin, but instead are rewarded with new coins for participating in processing transactions and updating the “blockchain” using their computer.

The key to all of this is understanding what a blockchain is and the purpose it serves in currencies like bitcoin. You can read about this in much more detail at the link, but we’ll cover the basics here.

In a nutshell, think of a blockchain as a public ledger or record that contains all of the information you want to store. For cryptocurrencies, this contains all of the transaction data ever executed in the currency. Each “block” contains data about where coins were sent and who owns them, and with Bitcoin at least, a new block is created every 10 minutes.

Every block also contains a summary of the previous block, which is created using a hash algorithm. A hash is, essentially, a way of encoding data of any amount of data into a fixed length, to act as verification. It’s a very handy way of encapsulating datasets that might grow or change over time, such as a blockchain, but it’s not the same as encrypting data. Importantly, even small changes in the data can create big changes in the hash, so it’s a good way of ensuring consistency over long periods of time.

Read More What is a blockchain? – Gary Explains If you have heard of Bitcoin or any of the other cryptocurrencies, then you have probably heard the word blockchain or the term ""blockchain technology"". But what is a blockchain? How does it apply to …

For example, using the CRC32 hash algorithm, the world “hello” is transformed into 3610a686. So if I send you both the message and the hash, and you use the same algorithm on the message, you can check the hash and know that the message hasn’t been tampered with along the way. But if you received the word “hel1o”, the hash would be 3905859f, so you’d easily spot even a subtle change to the message just by comparing the hash.

So a series of blocks forms the “blockchain” and the important component that links them all together is the hash data of the previous block – makes sense? The hash here is very important because it allows the currency to check that a newly created block, or updated transaction record, is consistent with all the existing blocks, and that someone hasn’t attempted to retroactively change information. The most obvious example of such a sly change would be attempting to say that a wallet contains more bitcoins that it should.

bitcoin

Creating a basic hash isn’t too difficult, but cryptocurrencies specifically implement difficult computing requirements (starting a hash with a number of zeros) in order to prevent manipulation and to act as a “proof of work” that ensures integrity, kind of like long division in school. A difficult hash that requires a lot of computational effort to solve is more trustworthy than a simple problem that requires very little work. This is because guessing a lot of incorrect hashes gives you a lot of examples of results you know are wrong.

It takes a long time to calculate all the possible input values that would produce a hash with the desired characteristics, which is where powerful processing hardware comes into the picture.

To sum up, the hash is used to secure a chain of blocks intrinsically linked to one another (a blockchain), as previous block hash data is used to create the new block. It would therefore be very difficult to create a fraudulent block of chains inconsistent with the publicly distributed data.

Mining digital currency

Now that we understand the basics of how blocks and hashes work together to form a blockchain, we can take a look at the concept of bitcoin mining. At this stage it’s also important to remember that cryptocurrency data isn’t stored in one central place, it’s spread around numerous public nodes which communicate with one another over the internet. As a simple explanation, bitcoin mining is essentially receiving payment for processing transactions, but let’s dive a little deeper.

Bitcoin mining can be split into a selection of parts. The first is compiling a list of all the new transactions since the last block was created, creating a new, updated one which includes recent trades of Bitcoin on an exchange or in payments between Bitcoin wallets. Mining then takes the header of the previous block and combines this into a hash. Finally, all of this is put together into a completed block, which is sent out to the network and accepted as part of the chain.

Computers crunch through this hashing algorithm in a race to be the first to find a solution below the target number. This is purely an effort in trial and error, although the approximate computing time required to solve the puzzle is known. The bitcoin network is designed to create a new block roughly every 10 minutes, regardless of the number of users in the network. As popularity surges the difficulty and individual calculation time for the hash increases, but it could also fall in the future.

Mining doesn't itself create new coins, instead these are given as rewards for calculating new blocks in the chain

Once the new block has been successfully calculated, it is announced to the network and the solver is awarded a new amount of the currency as a reward. Pooled mining networks will split this reward among its contributors, making it possible to earn fractions of currencies for participating in block creation. The new block can be easily checked to be consistent by other nodes in the network, and work then begins on figuring out the next block.

Given the distributed nature of cryptocurrency data and the fact that users are working in parallel to solve hash problems, it’s possible that two or more users may solve a block at any one time. In this case, the one with the largest total proof of work is accepted by the network. Again, this is because the more complex the computational work to achieve it, the more reliable the hash.

How cryptocurrency is mined

Given that calculating a hash is just a mathematical algorithm, they can be solved on common processing hardware, such as the CPU inside your computer or even your smartphone. However, as you’d want to do lots of mathematical calculations as quickly as possible to win the reward and without consuming too much power (cost), graphics processing units tend to be faster. While fast multi-core CPUs may be capable of handling tens of math instructions at once, GPUs can handle thousands.

Each cryptocurrency uses slightly different algorithms, some of which are designed specifically to run better on certain type of hardware, but the vast majority of these calculations are performed most efficiently on highly parallel processing units like GPUs. Better yet, custom FGPA and ASIC hardware designed specifically for mining algorithms can handle even more mathematical operations at a time to speed up the process.

Bitcoin mining algorithms run efficiently on highly parallel processors, such as graphics cards.

In addition, each currency also has its own selection of networking and mining software which enables mining on specific pieces of hardware, such as those listed above. They’re also essential for connecting to the wider currency network in order to grab transaction data and push completed hashes to the system. Most of these enable solo-mining but it’s more common for individuals to join mining pools, which will split the proceeds of block generation to its members, based on the processing work they contributed.

Originally, miners were cryptography enthusiasts, but now everyone from casual observers looking to spare a few GPU cycles right on through to industrial scale operations take part. The power needs of commercial Bitcoin mining operations in Iceland are ready to overtake its residential energy consumption this year, due in no small part to the country’s cost effective hydropower. Overall, bitcoin mining and the greater network is estimated to consume as much power as Denmark!

Wrap up

Cryptocurrency mining is almost as large a phenomenon as the digital currencies it generates. It has spawned a wave of interest in cryptography and blockchain, and drawn the interest of huge commercial operations looking to cash in on the cryptocurrency craze.

There are a lot of variables outside the scope of this article that weigh heavily on whether it’s worth becoming involved in bitcoin mining or other currencies. These can range from regional prices of electricity and graphics cards, to the current hash times and difficulties involved. Hopefully this serves as a springboard for your own research. Either way, as long as cryptocurrencies remain a hot commodity, there are bound to be people and companies looking to do the work of finding their own little nugget.

The Supreme Court of Israel issued a temporary injunction order on Monday forbidding Bank Leumi from sweepingly halting the account activity of the Bits of Gold bitcoin exchange. This is seen as a major victory in the Israeli cryptocurrency industry that will set a precedent for other bitcoin businesses struggling to get banking services.

Bits of Gold vs. Leumi

Since its inception in 2014, Bits of Gold has, which is licensed as a currency changer business, always held an account with Bank Leumi – one of the top two biggest banks in the country. In 2015, the bank decided to close its account despite the company’s meticulous conduct – only because the company deals in bitcoin, and then Bits of Gold decided to apply to the court for permission to continue using the account.

For several years Bits of Gold worked with an injunction that allowed it to act until a final verdict. A few months ago, the District Court authorized the bank not to allow Bits of Gold to trade in bitcoin, even though it praised its activities.

The company appealed this decision to the Israeli Supreme Court, which immediately issued a temporary injunction, and on Monday passed a temporary order according to which the company can trade digital coins in its account until a ruling is issued on the entire appeal.

The Supreme Court wrote: “It appears that the damages that the bank might incur are mere speculations for now. The decision of the bank is based on the assumption that the company’s activity indeed carries risks that arise in violation of the provisions of the law, and therefore the bank is liable to pay a price for the materialization of those risks. However until now, for more than five years in which the account has been operating, these fears have not materialized – as the District Court has determined that the company acted transparently and did not violate any statutory provision.”

Bank Leumi Not Giving In

“This is a precedent-setting decision whose importance can not be overemphasized in relation to the trading of digital currencies,” said lawyer Shaul Zioni of the legal firm who represented the company. “The court says banks actually can not ban the company’s activities sweepingly and that they should manage their risk.”

Yuval Roash, CEO of Bits of Gold said, “The court’s decision enables us to focus on continuing to establish the crypto community in Israel, and we will continue to lead the field in order to give digital coins the place which they deserve in the Israeli economy – as a tremendous growth engine for hi-tech and the financial industry. ”

Bank Leumi responded: “The bank respects the decion of the court. However, as long as the matter is not regulated by orderly regulatory directives, the bank’s exposure to the client’s activity in bitcoin will be valid – and not only towards the regulators in Israel who are obligated to respect the decisions of the Supreme Court, but also towards foreign regulators who do not consider themselves bound by the decisions of Israeli law. Therefore, as long as no binding legal provisions are determined by the regulator and the relevant parties, the bank will continue to manage the case until the temporary injunction is removed. ”

Second Bank Closes Account of Crypto Exchange

A major Thai financial institution, the state-owned Krungthai Bank, has “shut down crypto trade accounts,” the Bangkok Post reported on Monday. The bank has become the second in Thailand “to terminate transactions involving cryptocurrencies trading with Thai Digital Asset Exchange (TDAX),” a local cryptocurrency exchange.

The first bank was Bangkok Bank, which decided to terminate TDAX’s accounts with the bank last week. Earlier this month, Thailand’s central bank issued a circular, asking financial institutions to refrain from getting involved in five cryptocurrency activities.

Mr. Somchai Sujjapongse, the permanent secretary of the Finance Ministry and chairman of Krungthai Bank, ordered his bank on Monday “to halt any transactions related to cryptocurrencies with TDAX through the bank’s accounts,” the news outlet elaborated, adding that:

The move followed a Bank of Thailand request that financial institutions cooperate by refraining from making or being involved in cryptocurrency transactions, as the regulatory framework supervising digital currencies remains unclear.

Another Crypto Exchange Affected

TDAX is a privately-owned Thai cryptocurrency exchange. According to the publication, the exchange still has bank accounts with two other financial institutions: Kasikornbank (Kbank) and Siam Commercial Bank (SCB). Last week, Kbank confirmed that it was still providing service to TDAX.

According to the Bangkok Post, a source from another major domestic cryptocurrency exchange, Bx.in.th (BX), revealed that “Bangkok Bank has already terminated the exchange’s account, but did not reveal whether the termination occurred on the same day as TDAX’s termination.” Yuthavithi Rootwararit, founder and CEO of Crypto Trading Co Ltd, said, “BX’s trading volume and value are more than ten times larger than those of TDAX.”

ICOs Postponed

TDAX is also preparing to launch some initial coin offerings (ICOs). However, the regulatory uncertainty has prompted the exchange to announce that its ICO plans are now postponed.

The exchange recently completed an ICO for Jfin coin by J Ventures, a subsidiary of Jay Mart Plc which is listed on the Thai stock exchange. 100 million tokens were sold at the price of 6.60 baht per token. “Jfin coin will not be affected [by TDAX’s ICO decision], as this ICO was fully subscribed to on Feb 16, while the first trading day will be held on April 2,” Mr. Poramin Insom, TDAX’s CEO and founder, was quoted by the news outlet. He added:

Although there are five or six ICOs in the pipeline, the exchange has decided to impose a two-week postponement because market participants expect the SEC to unveil its ICO regulatory framework soon…We are waiting for the ICO regulations from the [Thai] SEC.

The Thai government is in the process of establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, which is expected “on March 8, followed by a fintech bill,” the Bangkok Post wrote. A source told the news outlet that the “ICO regulations are focused on supervising online exchanges, which will have to register themselves with the SEC.”

Bitcoin Dancers

A Las Vegas news show has featured a segment on an adult entertainment venue in the city which enables its dancers to get payments from clients directly via bitcoin transfers. The use of the cryptocurrency was primarily showcased as a privacy enhancing measure (preventing your wife from seeing the payments on the credit card bills) as well as an attraction for affluent bitcoin investors.

The Las Vegas strip club is called the Legends Room and we reported about its opening back in May 2017. The local news team interviewed the founder, Nick Blomgren, as well as a number of the adult dancers at the place. They even explained how visitors can use the in-house bitcoin ATM to buy cryptocurrency at the club. Furthermore, the dancers can choose to wear temporary QR tattoos as wallet addresses that can be scanned on a smartphone.

The Future of Adult Entertainment

Besides the privacy concerns of the patrons, the use of cryptocurrency allows the dancers to avoid explaining to banks where they get large amounts of cash. “I’m not going to name names, but there are certain banks that… will shut down your account and actually deny you from having an account because we work in the adult entertainment industry”, said Summer Chase.

Asked how often customers want to pay with bitcoin, Brenna Sparks answered: “Oh, quite often. Like the people that come here, they are like really into crypto. I feel like it’s very smart. They are really into that.” She says she likes checking her balance a lot, “It’s fun though. Once you invest, it becomes an everyday thing.” The 26 years old dancer became interested in cryptocurrency when she was just 19. Now she and her friends think cryptocurrency may be the future for adult entertainment workers. “It’s peer to peer. It’s anonymous, and it’s instant,” Sparks said.

“When I first heard about the concept, I thought wow this is really something different, you know,” said DJ Saint Clare who gets part of her salary in cryptocurrency.

Speaking during a Reddit AMA, Gates argued that “the government’s ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.

“Right now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way.” In contrast to cash, which is also untraceable, cryptocurrencies can be used remotely, which removes another avenue of control, he added.

Gates also suggested that investing in the sector is a bad idea: “I think the speculative wave around ICOs and cryptocurrencies is super risky”.

In the group interview, Gates had harsh words for some other speculative technologies. Elon Musk’s Hyperloop concept, for instance, which involves using a railgun to fire a passenger compartment down a low-pressure tube at speeds of several hundred miles per hour, was dismissed: “I am not sure the Hyperloop concept makes sense,” he said. “Making it safe is hard.”

But Gates was positive about the overall direction of technology, dismissing concerns that rising automation could have negative consequences for the wider economy, and citing natural language understanding as the technology he’s most looking forward to over the next decade.

“Automation has been driving productivity ever since the industrial revolution including things like tractors and garment making,” Gates said. “With software this will continue to accelerate so we need to think about how we educate people for the new jobs that will emerge.

“Overall automation is a great thing – eventually we won’t have to work as much but we are still at least a generation away from a big change there.”

Gates is not the only former tech executive to have a negative view of cryptocurrencies. Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, revealed on Tuesday that he had lost seven bitcoins to a scammer.

“Somebody bought them from me online through a credit card, and they cancelled the credit card payment,” he told a conference in India. “It was that easy. And it was from a stolen credit card number, so you can never get it back.” At the time the scam was carried out, the bitcoins were worth just under $5,000; now, their value tops $70,000.

Gates had one final word of warning for readers of his interview. Asked by one user: “Is it true that if I forward the email in my inbox to 100 people you will give me money?”, he replied, simply: “No.”",2018-02-28,https://gizmodo.com/bill-gates-thinks-cryptocurrency-is-killing-people-in-a-1823381081,"Photo : AP

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose recent takes have included that Apple should just build a backdoor into the iPhone because the government might demand it anyway, is now warning that cryptocurrency is killing people.

As noted by CNBC, during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session on Tuesday, Gates explained that he thinks cryptocurrency is really bad because it aids and abets people who want to keep their financial transactions hidden from the government. He seemed particularly concerned with whether the blockchain revolution is mostly revolutionizing financial crime, terrorism, and drug dealing, thus killing people “in a fairly direct way”:

The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don’t think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.

Gates is far from objectively wrong here—the crypto space is chock full of outright thieving and pump-and-dump schemes, while authorities claim criminals the world over hide billions in profits in various coins. Hard cash is technically vaguely anonymous in the sense that it circulates freely without being tracked all the time, but it’s a lot harder to transfer secretly than crypto. (You have to carry cash, which is probably hard on the glutes, or route it through state-monitored financial institutions.) New varieties of token that are taking off in the wake of Bitcoin also seem to have conveniently crime-friendly features (hmm) like even greater anonymity and hidden transaction histories.

Yet that transition has been driven in part because Bitcoin is too hot for criminals, and also in part because authorities are starting to get a lot better at tracking down and busting criminals who try to anonymize themselves with crypto.

There’s the fact that some of the crimes to which Gates alluded, like drug dealing and terrorism, have an irreplaceable physical element. If you’re a drug dealer or a terrorist, at some point you’re going to have to lug actual drugs or guns or bombs around, and payment or funding is only one part of the equation as to how the police can track you down. Authorities can also suppress illicit crypto activity by going after the hard points where the blockchain by necessity meets IRL, like exchanges where tokens can turn into cash, and appear to already be doing so.

In most rich countries, crime is falling dramatically, perhaps in part because the authorities are better capable of using technology to fight crime than criminals are to increase it. Problems like the opioid crisis also are much more deeply rooted than whatever payment mechanism is used, you know?

So, again, Gates isn’t wrong, but in lieu of the collapse of organized government and a descent into a dystopian cyberpunk universe, it’s pretty hard to determine what impact crypto is actually having on the public’s safety. For what it’s worth, there are plenty of reasons to be somewhat skeptical about cryptocurrency that have nothing to do with money laundering or terrorism, like its Tulip mania-esque boom and bust cycle that increasingly hints at destabilizing the real economy, or how a non-negligible portion of the market is built on people legally exploiting dopes who think they can ride price surges to easy riches.

[CNBC/Reddit]",,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/new-sovereign-cryptocurrency-will-be-legal-tender-marshall-islands,"The Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), an island country located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean with a population of about 50,000, is poised to become the first sovereign nation to issue a cryptocurrency that will be legal tender.

The new currency is called “Sovereign” with the symbol “SOV.” The SOV, which will be distributed to the public via an Initial Currency Offering (ICO), will circulate as legal tender in the country, alongside its current local currency, the U.S. dollar.

Y-combinator Israeli fintech startup Neema is partnering with RMI to issue the SOV, starting with a presale that will be followed by an ICO later this year.

“SOV is a big deal because, until now, all cryptos were in regulatory limbo,” Barak Ben-Ezer, co-founder of Neema, told Bitcoin Magazine. “None of them was considered ‘real’ money by the IRS, SEC, etc. Accordingly, the IRS taxed them with capital gain tax, and the SEC wants to regulate all ICOs as issuance of securities. The IRS explained in 2014 why it’s not considered real money: because it’s not the legal tender of a sovereign nation.”

The solution for Neema was to find a country to partner with to create a cryptocurrency which would become the legal tender of a sovereign nation. “So SOV has the benefits of cryptocurrency and the legal and regulatory framework that covers sovereign currencies. You can use it without worrying about capital gains and even the ICO may be like selling any currency — Euro, Yen, etc.,” said Ben-Ezer.

SOV is based on a permissioned protocol, dubbed “‘Yokwe” (meaning “hello” in the local language), which requires blockchain users to authenticate. According to the SOV promoters, this “solves the anonymity problem that plagued bitcoin and precluded its mainstream adoption.”

The official statement notes that there’s a huge market need for a non-anonymous blockchain system that can operate within a regulated environment. The SOV wants to be part of a broader E-conomy vision to create a society that uses blockchain technology intensively, with a cryptocurrency and biometric IDs securely recorded on the blockchain.

“SOV is the promising starting point for the adoption of cryptocurrencies by sovereign nations,” said Peter Dittus, former secretary general of the Bank of International Settlements and Neema’s senior economic advisor. “The Yokwe protocol provides a promising balance between transparency and privacy and we’re excited to develop it further. It’s state of the art technology, put to good use, with the right values in mind and a clear purpose.”

“This is a historic moment for our people, finally issuing and using our own currency, alongside the USD,” said RMI President Hilda C. Heine. “It is another step of manifesting our national liberty. Allocating SOV units directly to the citizens will circulate the currency and distribute wealth efficiently to our people. In addition, The RMI will invest the revenues to support its climate change efforts, green energy, healthcare for those still affected by the U.S. nuclear tests and education.”

“The Marshall Islands is the first nation to adopt a transparent crypto monetary system, and we are proud of it,” added David Paul, Minister-in-Assistance to the President and Environment Minister of the RMI. “We are excited to be the world’s first nation to leapfrog into the era of digital currencies. 10 percent of our proceeds from the ICO will be directed toward a Green Climate Fund.” Paul added that he is especially proud of SOV since it is based on the Yokwe blockchain framework that has all the benefits of Bitcoin minus the anonymity.

Earlier in 2018, the Maduro government in Venezuela launched a cryptocurrency dubbed Petro, claiming that it was the world’s first sovereign cryptocurrency. The SOV statement notes that, contrary to the Petro, the SOV will be legal tender of the country, as defined in a bill passed by the parliament. Furthermore, the RMI is a close ally of the U.S., whereas Venezuela is under embargo. SOV will be a decentralized cryptocurrency with a price that is uniquely determined by the market, whereas the Petro, initially pegged to the price of oil, can be manipulated at will by the Venezuelan government.

The RMI is a tiny island nation, but it is a sovereign nation and a member of the UN. Therefore, if the RMI will eventually deploy a cryptocurrency that is also legal tender, the impact could be huge.",2018-02-28 17:14:04+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/germany-considers-crypto-legal-equivalent-to-fiat-for-tax-purposes,"Germany won’t tax bitcoin users for using the cryptocurrency as a means of payment, the Ministry of Finance has said.

The guidance, published Tuesday, sets Germany apart from the U.S., where the Internal Revenue Service treats bitcoin as property for tax purposes – which means that if an American buys a cup of coffee with bitcoin, it’s technically considered a sale of property and potentially subject to capital gains tax.

Instead, Germany will regard bitcoin as the equivalent to legal tender for tax purposes when used as a means of payment, according to a new document.

The Bundesministerium der Finanzen based its guidance on a 2015 European Union Court of Justice ruling on value added taxes (VAT).

The court ruling creates a precedent for European Union nations to tax bitcoin while providing exemptions for certain types of transactions.

Notably, the new German document justified its tax decisions by regarding cryptocurrencies a legal method for payment, stating:

“Virtual currencies (cryptocurrencies, e.g., Bitcoin) become the equivalent to legal means of payment, insofar as these so-called virtual currencies of those involved in the transaction as an alternative contractual and immediate means of payment have been accepted.”

For tax purposes, this means that converting bitcoin into a fiat currency or vice versa is “a taxable miscellaneous benefit.” When a buyer of goods pays with bitcoin, an article of the EU’s VAT Directive will be applied to the price of bitcoin at the time of the transaction, as documented by the seller, according to the document.

However, as per the EU ruling, the actual act of converting a cryptocurrency to fiat or vice versa is classified as a “supply of services,” and therefore a party acting as an intermediary for the exchange will not be taxed.

Payment fees sent to digital wallet providers or other services can likewise also be taxed, according to the document.

Other aspects of the cryptocurrency ecosystem will not be taxed. Miners who receive block rewards will not be taxed, as their services are considered to be voluntary, according to the document.

Similarly, exchange operators that buy or sell bitcoin in their own name as an intermediary will receive a tax exemption, though an exchange operating as a technical marketplace will not receive any such exemption.

Dorsey, who is also the CEO of Twitter, specifically discussed the company’s Cash App, which now allows all users to buy and sell Bitcoin, telling Market Watch:

“Bitcoin, for us, is not stopping at buying and selling. We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry, and we want to learn as quickly as possible.”

According to Square’s 2017 Q4 report, also published Feb. 27, the company’s total net revenue and adjusted revenue have significantly increased compared to Q3 of 2017. Specifically regarding Bitcoin use in Square’s Cash App, the report stated positively:

“Additionally, customers can now buy and sell Bitcoin in Cash App. We observed that this was a feature our customers wanted, and we support Bitcoin because we see it as a step in the long-term path toward greater financial access for all.”

Currently available in 50 US states, Cash App allows its users to carry out instant fiat transactions, free cash-outs, and instant Bitcoin buy/sell option, which was first launched for a limited part of users in November, 2017. On Jan. 31, Square released the Bitcoin buy/sell option to almost all users.

It’s one of the most exciting commodities to invest with its high volatile nature belonging to one of the most developing software .i.e. Blockchain.

Over the past 6-8 months, we have seen cryptocurrencies reach to the best of their prices and to the least of their prices as well.

Bitcoin touched $19,000 mark in December 2017, Ripple touched $3.84 mark in January 2018 when Japanese government put their stamp of trust over it.

Other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum experienced the same heights in 2017.

But after these skyrocketing numbers, cryptocurrency market had a quick fall.

They maintained their momentum at the beginning of 2018 but their prices fell fast and hard after that.

Bitcoin leapt from whopping $19,000 to $7000 and Ripple leapt from $3.84 to $0.76.

In brief, they have had their share of ups and downs in 2017 but what holds in the market for cryptocurrencies in 2018?

Will they soar to their old as well as new heights? Or Will they come crashing down harder and faster this time?

I am sure you have had the same question in the past or whenever you hear Bitcoin, Ripple or Cryptocurrency word in the news it makes you question their existence and their future as well.

We study the cryptocurrency market and here’s our prediction for cryptocurrencies in 2018.

Present Momentum of Cryptocurrencies:

Before we go and discuss what’s in the future of for cryptocurrency, let’s take a look at what’s happening these days in the cryptocurrency market.

After hitting the lowest point of $7,000 over January, Bitcoin is back on a good pace with the current price of $10,209.

On 19th Feb, Bitcoin almost soared to $11,000 when the investors started putting their money and faith back in Bitcoin after the correction of a small technical error.

At this moment, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is fluctuating between $160 Billion to $170 Billion.

Whereas Bitcoin is catching up on its pace, Ripple is a bit behind currently valued at $0.96/ Per XRP.

Other Present Day Prices of Cryptocurrencies:

Currencies Highest Fell to (Lowest) Present Day Ethereum $1,396 $697 $844 Litecoin $366 $143 $221 Bitcoin Cash $3,831 $784 $1,248

Cryptocurrencies went on to become one of the most expensive commodities of recent times before falling back to normalcy.

But the story doesn’t end here.

They are back on track to become the most expensive trading commodity there is!

And future predictions may have some concerns that you won’t like but the future for Cryptocurrencies seem to be brighter than ever.

Let’s discuss the future and the factors that will affect this new road for Cryptocurrencies.

Future Predictions and Affecting Factors:

Presently, the cryptocurrencies are not at their best or worst.

They are just picking up the momentum but the major hurdle they are facing is the government.

The governments aren’t legalizing the buying and selling of cryptocurrency and they are avoiding these volatile currencies at any cost. They are not ready to accept this unauthorized money exchange where they don’t have any idea about the transactions taking place.

Traditionally all the money you have is either in the bank or invested somewhere and banks are involved in these transactions where they can monitor your movements and your liquidity. They have all the information of one’s fortune.

This is known as the centralized system. Governed by a central authority.

Whereas Cryptocurrencies are decentralized currencies without any entity to govern the transactions. But that doesn’t make it unsafe for investing. A person has to complete a proper verification carried out by the network and are charged with standard transaction fees as well.

Limitations of Cryptocurrencies:

Cryptocurrencies being decentralized currencies where there is no government to manipulate and interfere with your monetary decisions and transactions are prone to many uncertainties as well.

Other limitations that cryptocurrencies presently face – such as the fact that one’s digital fortune can be erased by a computer crash, or that a virtual vault may be ransacked by a hacker.

Even though there are risks in buying cryptocurrencies as of now but in the future, they might not be so volatile.

All the above-mentioned limitations can be overcome in time through technological advances.

The irony of the cryptocurrency market is that they want to keep it decentralized but with the increasing traction worldwide it is possible that they will attract more regulation and government speculation.

Besides this, the merchants accepting cryptocurrencies as a payment option have increased but they are still in the minority part.

For cryptocurrencies to become globally accepted, they have to first gain universal faith and acceptance among consumers. However, their relative complex structure compared to regular currencies can become the reason for its unacceptance.

For cryptocurrencies to be a part of mainstream financial system, they have a long road ahead for them with such different criteria to satisfy.

First of all, It would be a huge challenge mathematically to elude the chances of hacking attacks and fraud and at the same time making it easier to understand and use for consumers.

Other issues they might face are: maintaining decentralized feature but at the same time having proper consumer safeguards and protection. Protecting consumers identification and providing total anonymity can encourage illegal activities like tax evasion, money laundering and steering clear from these can be the biggest challenge.

In regards to the future of Cryptocurrencies, Thomas Glucksmann of GateCoin told CNBC: “Increasing regulatory recognition of cryptocurrency exchanges, the entrance of institutional capital and major technology developments will contribute to the market’s rebound and push cryptocurrency prices to all new highs this year.”

He also added Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, could be “pushing $50,000 by December 2018.“

Conclusion

While the possibility of Cryptocurrencies skyrocketing again seems higher, there are slight chances that the decentralization feature of cryptocurrencies could cause trouble to the cryptocurrency market in 2018.

But despite these shortcomings, cryptocurrencies have taken the world by storm after 2013 and they have progressed a lot since its conception in 2009.

Recently, BlackRock, an investment giant, mentioned Bitcoin and its chance of being more acceptable globally in their weekly report.

They said, “Our bottom line: We see cryptocurrencies potentially becoming more widely used in the future as the markets mature.”

But at the same time advised keeping away from them if you can stomach complete losses.

These were our predictions for cryptocurrency market in 2018.

Comment below and let us know what you think about the future of cryptocurrencies.",2018-03-07 20:48:20+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/circle-x-crypto-exchange-will-coinbase-challenger,"In the not-so-distant future, VC-backed startup Circle has plans to create a type of crypto cantina.

The news comes following Circle’s buyout of cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex, announced Feb. 26. Notably, the acquisition is one of, if not the largest, acquisitions in the industry to date.

Circle president Sean Neville told CoinDesk:

“Rather than seeing a single Star Wars-type token that is good for everything across the galaxy, we’ll see a proliferation of tokens that have different functions.”

To that end, Neville believes the new service, formally called Circle Poloniex for now, will offer an entirely new kind of exchange, one that gives users access to a whole host of cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens.

According to Circle executives, the acquisition is a win-win for both companies.

Circle customers will once again have the ability to buy and sell bitcoin (a service the company shut down in December 2016) and many other cryptocurrencies. And Poloniex’s customers will get access to Circle’s well-oiled and licensed business machinery, which has been developed over the past five years with $140 million in venture capital.

The benefits for Poloniex will likely be huge since the exchange’s fast-paced business has slowed somewhat in the past several months in the face of an onslaught of complaints about its service.

While some reports put the acquisition price tag at $400 million, Circle execs did not confirm that number to CoinDesk, explaining that the deal started last spring.

According to Circle founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire, the startup now employs more than 200 people and expects to hire 100 more to fulfill its vision of monetary pluralism.

Allaire said:

“It’s a turning point in that we’re really right on the cusp of major consumer products being able to be built on top of these markets and this infrastructure.”

What is Circle X?

At the core of this transformation is what Circle refers to as “Circle X” – the concept that, in the future, exchanges will not be broken down into types at all.

Instead, Neville anticipates, exchanges will be less specialized than they are today and will host a vast array of tokens that represent everything from traditional equities to new assets (as cryptocurrencies already do today).

“We see the future of Poloniex as a full marketplace where tokens can represent all kinds of assets and all kinds of contractual agreements,” Neville said. “We’ll see things that are really meant for settlement or for utility value that may be somewhat less volatile from a markets perspective. And we’ll see some tokens that really are equities, and that is okay.”

Instead of cryptocurrency exchanges being different than stock exchanges being different than cash markets, Circle believes all that trading will happen in one place – in a seamless backend that connects the digital world to the real world.

Allaire told CoinDesk:

“From our perspective, pulling this all together, pulling this under one roof, allows us to realize those broader ideas for consumer products.”

As such, this new type of exchange could not only give traditional cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase a run for their money, but could also compete with alternative trading systems (ATS) like tZero and Templum, which focus on listing crypto tokens that are regulated as securities.

As part of this “evolution,” as Neville calls it, he envisions integrating fiat currencies into Poloniex’s current product.

While Poloniex allows trades of roughly 100 different cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens, exchange users have had to move those funds to platforms like Circle’s to convert into fiat. But Circle will be able to leverage its existing regulatory compliance work to accelerate the addition of a number of fiat currencies into the exchange service.

“We have the licenses and the relationships in order to make that happen across U.S. dollars, but also euros and [British] pounds,” he said.

While there are currently no plans to de-list any of Poloniex’s existing tokens, Neville said Circle is are currently building a “legal framework” that will accelerate the rate at which desirable tokens could be added to that platform.

Solving problems

And not only is Circle looking to add to Poloniex’s service, it also wants to take care of some of the issues the exchange was facing as well.

Complaints have been coming in about delayed transactions and ignored requests on public channels for some time. In an effort to confront the problems head-on, Neville said Circle will make available several of its custom tools.

For instance, an internally developed tool dubbed “Diameter” was highlighted as a means to solve Poloniex’s issues handling the amount of customer service requests it receives.

Diameter connects directly to the backend processes of a platform and acts as a filter before human customer service agents get involved. By automatically surfacing solutions based on specific problems, the human teams are able to deal with more traffic through the use of the tool.

Currently, Diameter is used by Circle’s global support team in Europe and the U.S.

“It’s a natural match for what Poloniex needs, particularly in the short-term,” said Neville.

In the long-term, however, perhaps a more crucial benefit of the acquisition relates to dealing with financial regulations. In the press release announcing the acquisition, Circle specifically named compliance as one of the key areas it could help Poloniex.

In interview, though, Neville downplayed the issue a bit, saying that Poloniex has “done a good job adhering to the laws they need to adhere to in order to support their customers.”

Yet, New York Times reporter Nathaniel Popper tweeted a link to an image that appears to indicate that the SEC agreed to stand down in pursuing enforcement actions against Poloniex if Circle registered the exchange as an alternative trading system.

While Allaire did not confirm whether the information was accurate, to questions about the tweet, he said:

“We believe the technology developed by firms like Circle is complementary to this mission, and look forward to working closely with all our regulatory stakeholders, both domestic and abroad.”

Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Circle and Coinbase.

50 Cent may not be a Bitcoin millionaire after all, but Ermias Asghedom — better known by his rap moniker Nipsey Hussle — certainly knows what’s good with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The rapper from Los Angeles invested in Bitcoin back in 2013 and owns an ownership stake in Amsterdam-based crypto company Follow Coin. Last month, Asghedom shared his wisdom with XXL. Here’s what you need to know.

Mainstream Adoption Is on the Way

If you think cryptocurrencies are valuable now — with Bitcoin currently pushing $10K at press time — just wait until digital currencies receive mainstream adoption. According to Nipsey Hussle, that’s when things will really take off. He told XXL:

But imagine when you can pay for Starbucks with cryptocurrency, when you could checkout on Amazon with your cryptocurrency. What will that do to the value and the confidence of people investing? That’s the opportunity. When retail accepts it as a form of payment, you gonna see the real boom. For these coins to be where they’re at, it lets you know how high the ceiling is.

The FUD Is All Political

Anytime the FUD is coming in thick and hot, you can bet that’s all courtesy of the powers that be. As noted by Asghedom, financial institutions and governments are threatened by decentralized currencies and blockchain technology — so you shouldn’t buy into their rhetoric. He told XXL:

Right, and just for the record, the resistance is purely political. I don’t think that the resistance is organic. Because this currency is not linked to central banks. It’s unregulated. That means a lot for the power structure that exists now. People that’s in power—the central banks, these fiat currencies that are traded globally—they got influence over the messaging and the narrative in the media. When you see people on Fox and traditional investors saying, ‘Don’t invest. Don’t put your money in these coins,’ that’s not actual financial advice. That’s political rhetoric.

The Utility Is Obvious

Though Nipsey Hussle urges caution when investing in cryptocurrencies, he certainly doesn’t lack confidence in the technology’s promise. For him, Bitcoin’s utility is as plain as day. He says:

Bitcoin is still really new. I do agree with the critics saying be careful. And don’t think that you found a get-rich-quick scheme. I don’t think that’s what this is. Look at the reality of what’s going on—it makes perfect sense for there to be an unregulated peer-to-peer currency that people can exchange goods and services via, without it being linked to a central bank. And it’s no ulterior motive. It’s honest, between the two parties. And the transaction is transparent. So, where is the flaw in that?

The Best Is yet to Come

From Nipsey Hussle’s perspective, we haven’t even scratched the surface of the blockchain’s potential. The rapper, like many others, sees the blockchain as the next technological revolution akin to the internet. He explained to XXL:

[Chris Lloyd] told me, ‘Nip, this how you gotta look at the blockchain. The blockchain is like the internet in 1994. Fast-forward the internet to 2018, we got Facebook, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Amazon. All multi-billion dollar industries that was built off of this technological innovation called the internet.’ There’s all these entrepreneurs that are gonna use the opportunity that the blockchain creates to build the next Google. They’re in their lab building right now. And over the next five, 10 years, we’re gonna see these things pop up.

Do Your Own Research

Finally, Nipsey Hussle’s got one more extremely important piece of advice, which every single investor would be wise to follow — DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! As for why, he states:

Just educate yourself. Do your research, your due diligence. It’ll take a week and you’ll be able to absorb the majority of the important information. It’s not a hard concept to understand. If you can understand supply and demand […] you can understand cryptocurrency.

Speaking at the Economic Times of India's Global Business Summit on Saturday, Steve Wozniak told attendees how he was scammed out of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin. According to Wozniak, the perpetrator agreed to purchase seven bitcoins via credit card, then cancelled the payment after the transaction went through.

The credit card itself was apparently stolen, so there was no legal recourse available, according to the Economic Times.

Wozniak bought the bitcoin several years ago when it was worth around $700 per coin. The amount he was conned out of has a value of $74,800 at recent market value.

Speaking to the audience, Wozniak noted that he was never interested in the cryptocurrency for its potential to appreciate in value. He just wanted to travel without carrying credit cards or cash, having researched which hotels and other destinations would accept bitcoin beforehand.

Wozniak hasn't let the experience sour him on bitcoin, having originally being drawn to the fact that the cryptocurrency can't be manipulated by any government.

""Bitcoins to me was a currency that was not manipulated by the governments,"" Wozniak said. ""It is mathematical, it is pure, it can't be altered.""

There is no intermediary bank in crypto-transactions. Transactions that involve buying or selling crypto in exchange for another currency or for goods and services occur directly between users and are recorded in a ""blockchain,"" a public ledger that exists as a distributed database.

Essentially, a fraction of a coin is sent to the anonymous address of a user. Transactions are effectively an encrypted message that delivers the identifying number of the coin encrypted using the public key of the buyer and a secret random private key of the transaction. This transaction is recorded in the blockchain, allowing the buyer to later sell their received crypto by using the correct private key and using it to transfer the crypto to a new buyer using that buyer's public key.",
