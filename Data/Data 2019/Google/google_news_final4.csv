A new study found that the cryptocurrency Bitcoin requires a lot of electricity, leaving a significant carbon footprint -- one that rivals the environmental impact of Las Vegas or a small country like Sri Lanka.

Each year, Bitcoin generates about 22 megatons in CO2 emissions, the researchers estimate.

Cyptocurrencies such as Bitcoin depend on blockchain technology to confirm transactions like transferring funds.

However, this validation process uses ""vast amounts of electricity,"" which causes some serious carbon emissions, according to the study from researchers at the Technical University of Munich and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The researchers looked at effects of Bitcoin mining, which allows people to painstakingly earn cryptocurrency without spending any money.

To estimate the electricity consumption, the study authors used IP addresses and hardware data from recent IPO filings.

The authors wrote that their study points to potential drawbacks of blockchain technology that should be considered by policymakers.

""Naturally there are bigger factors contributing to climate change. However, the carbon footprint is big enough to make it worth discussing the possibility of regulating cryptocurrency mining in regions where power generation is especially carbon-intensive,"" one of the authors, Christian Stoll, said in a statement

""To improve the ecological balance, one possibility might be to link more mining farms to additional renewable generating capacity.""",2019-06-14,https://qz.com/1642172/jack-dorsey-on-bitcoin-facebooks-crypto-and-the-end-of-cash/,"Jack Dorsey is best known for co-founding Twitter, the micro-posting website that now has around 330 million users around the world. In 2009, the computer programmer also co-founded Square, which was originally designed to help small businesses accept credit cards.

Dorsey’s other San Francisco-based startup, known for its plastic card-reader dongle, has widened its footprint over the years. More than 15 million people use Square’s Cash App for peer-to-peer payments, and its lending business made more than $500 million in loans in the first three months of 2019. The company launched in the UK two years ago and has offered bitcoin trading since January 2018.

Square has had great timing: investors have been eagerly buying payment company stocks, encouraged by the mega-shift toward online commerce and electronic transactions. Square has also had missteps: the Wall Street Journal reported this month that the company inadvertently sent some users’ email receipts to the wrong people.

Quartz spoke with Dorsey at Square’s offices in London about his vision for the future of finance, bitcoin, the end of cash, and how to handle receipt mixups. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Quartz: Do you have a prediction for the future of finance?

Dorsey: I don’t think there’s any one person who understands the financial system. All we can do is just look at the secular trends of what might impact it, and there are two big secular trends. A lot of our decisions are going to be more and more shifted to algorithms. And those algorithms also need to be able to explain why they made the decision they made, and what criteria they’re using.

As we think about finance and loans and mortgages and whatnot, suddenly what was a human decision, which may have had some subjectivity in it, becomes an algorithm, which might be more objective as long as we’re training these algorithms without bias, and on very clean datasets that are looking at a much broader audience and community.

They are black boxes. Right now they’re not being written in such a way that they can explain the criteria being used, or how they actually made the decision. I imagine that’s going to be a lot of the work is ensuring that algorithms can explain themselves, but also that they’re doing so without bias, which is a threat. That will have a significant impact, and if we fix those problems then I imagine that we will be able to increase the access because it will increase the velocity and therefore the scale.

What is the second trend?

The second secular trend is blockchain and cryptocurrency. And I guess the way I think about this is we have all these currencies for every nation state, but if you consider the internet to be the equivalent to a nation state, it will have a currency native to itself, and there is not going to be any one party or institution that makes this happen, and there’s not going to be any one party or institution that can stop it from happening. And having a global currency that is native to the internet will allow companies like ours to move much faster and reach a lot more people.

This is our one opportunity to align every community, and every country, around the world, which I think provides a lot of clarity, enables a lot more innovation, and most importantly creates a probability of much greater access for more people. As we bring more people online, we can also imagine a trend in parallel where they all have access to the same currency, and there are still conversions to a local currency like the pound, but being able to have one currency really takes away some of the barriers of the past and how we think about global markets.

There have been reports about a Facebook coin. Do you think that it could be the global internet currency?

“I would hope that all private companies can see the value of having a stateless currency that all people can access.”

All of them have been rumors, so I don’t know what they’re building and I don’t know the details. I’d have to see that to have an informed decision. But I would go back to, we need a currency for the internet. And the internet being an entity that isn’t controlled by any company or any one government, that is for the world and for the people of the world.

That is what I would want to help make happen. I would hope that all private companies can see the value of having a stateless currency that all people can access, and is not bounded or constrained by any one corporate entity.

Do you think bitcoin could be the internet’s currency?

I haven’t seen any other currency that would challenge it across the dimensions that I think are really important. First, I think it has an amazing brand. The other thing that I think makes it probably the strongest candidate is that the principles behind it are very pure. The creation of it was very pure, and focused on a public good, rather than any other particular agenda. The fact that it’s meant to be deflationary, meant to incentivize savings instead of spending, I think is a net positive for the world and how we think about consuming. Because it is a scarce resource, it has a probability of always increasing in value, which makes you consider a lot more how you spend it. Because you know that spending it today—it might go up in a week. And purchasing coffee, or a new sofa, with that really puts everything in perspective. Do I really need this? So from a psychological perspective, I think that’s interesting.

And finally, I think it’s been resilient. It’s 10 years old now, so it’s been tested over those 10 years, across every dimension from security threats, to governments, to forks, to agendas from miners, to nefarious nation states, and it’s been resilient to all those threats and challenges. And resilience is very valuable. There could be an upstart cryptocurrency that could challenge it, but it doesn’t have those tests and that memory of those challenges built into it.

The community around it is very passionate, and it’s been a dream for cryptographers for 30 or 40 years. So to realize something that is now usable, there’s just so many people who want to make it happen and want to make it better. And I think they do so with the right principles, I think they do so with the internet principles of having a connected world where anyone can participate and everyone has equal access. I think it’s quite powerful.

Last week there was a Wall Street Journal report about some Square electronic receipts getting sent to the wrong people. How widespread was that, and is it something you anticipate will happen in the future?

First and foremost, this is a rather new thing. Digital receipts is something we’ve believed in as a convenience. It’s something we want to make sure that people have a lot of simple control over and we need to constantly evolve this. We need to make sure we are providing the right controls, that people are getting the receipts in a place that they receive and intend to receive them. After we get more and more fine-grained identities that becomes even easier. In some cases people share cards, and there’s one identity per card. These are all things we can fix.

But these are new experiences. So we’re going to run into things like this, and our job is to make sure we adapt to them very quickly.

Do you personally carry cash?

Only in markets where it’s still dominant. I mean, Japan is still cash driven. That’s changing very quickly…

The government wants it to.

“In the US I don’t carry cash at all.”

The government is incentivizing both sellers and consumers to move in this direction through direct subsidies and whatnot. And then you have the 2020 Olympics coming up where you have this global audience coming in, and intending and expecting to pay in a way that they pay every day at home. So that’s changing quite quickly.

But generally, no. In the US I don’t carry cash at all, and I don’t really require it here at all, and everywhere but Japan I haven’t really needed it. Do you?

Not really. It’s nice to have as a back up. Last night, I was at a corner shop and their payment machine was down and there was an ATM around the corner.

It’s inconvenient. It took us a long time to convince folks in the United States, especially small businesses, of the inconvenience of it. And it’s actually more costly than accepting credit cards and digital payments because of theft and having to go to the bank and storing it and all these other dynamics that people don’t necessarily think of.

And the most important cost to it is missing sales. If you can’t accept a credit card, you have a high probability of not doing what you did: not going to an ATM but just leaving and going to another place.

And that seems like it’s changing globally. You see fewer and fewer ATMs because there’s less need for cash because so many stores have been digitized.

It makes sense for governments to preserve cash, even at a loss, for a long time to make sure that it’s there for the redundancy, and to make sure it’s there for people who are left behind.

“The whole financial system works because there’s a graceful degradation.”

I don’t think any of this stuff goes away, ever. Because I think the whole financial system works because there’s a graceful degradation. Even credit cards, when they were first introduced, you know, you have a magnetic strip on the back, and you have the chip, and you typically have raised numbers.

So if the magnetic strip wore off, you could still do an imprint of the number, and if that wore down then you can still read the number. So the whole system is designed to gracefully degrade to the lowest common denominator. And that’s probably how we’ll see cash. It’ll be the lowest common denominator, and a back up, but the predominant usage will be digital, and probably not even the plastic cards that we’re using.",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-14/bitcoin-turns-haven-with-biggest-exchange-to-restrict-u-s-users,"Why did this happen?

In a press release published Friday, crypto payments firm CLIC Technology said it is collaborating with blockchain infrastructure provider and B2B platform Opporty to develop an app-like browser extension allowing Amazon customers to pay for items in the ether (ETH) token, even though Amazon itself does not accept cryptocurrencies.

The effort will be based on Plasma Cash, a technology outlined last March by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Opporty’s implementation of the concept – a payments scaling solution similar to bitcoin’s lightning network – “will bring a modern day cryptocurrency economy one step closer to becoming a reality,” trumpets CLIC in the release.

The Plasma Cash implementation would “dramatically accelerate” transaction speeds when compared with those on the ethereum blockchain, the firm added.

“Bringing cryptocurrency to the e-commerce marketplace is the merging of two next-generation industries,” said Roman Bond, CEO at CLIC Technology. “We’re excited to be working on this project with Opporty, and to move forward on a number of other ambitious projects with them as well.”

Going forward, the two companies plan to build similar payment products for other cryptocurrencies too, listing ERC-20, ERC-721 and other ethereum standards as options currently being considered.

CLIC Technology is developing a crypto-payment platform called CLICPay, which is now in the pilot phase, according to the release.

Amazon app image via Shutterstock",2019-06-14 10:20:18+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/binance-exchange-to-block-crypto-trading-for-u-s-customers,"Binance.com, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is revamping its internal policies and cracking down on wayward users.

The Malta-based exchange announced Friday morning that it was reviewing user accounts to ensure they follow Binance’s terms of use and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and will remove deposit and trading permissions for anyone in violation of its policies.

In an updated terms of use agreement revised on June 14, the exchange’s general site notably stated that “Binance is unable to provide services to any U.S. person.”

The news comes less than a day after Binance announced it was formally expanding to the U.S. via a dedicated platform. The exchange also previously said it would strengthen its compliance and security practices through a number of partnerships, most notably with software provider Chainalysis and KYC/AML tool provider IdentityMind.

“Binance constantly reviews user accounts to improve our platform security and to comply with global compliance requirements,” the company said, adding:

“Accordingly, some users may be required to furnish evidence showing that their account registrations are consistent with Binance’s Terms of Use. Binance regrettably cannot continue to serve users who are found to have violated the Terms of Use and are unable to demonstrate otherwise.”

The exchange further stated that effective on Sept. 12, 2019, “users who are not in accordance with Binance’s Terms of Use will continue to have access to their wallets and funds, but will no longer be able to trade or deposit on Binance.com.”

Previously, Binance listed 15 countries and six U.S. states (including New York) on a “restricted countries list” page.

Per the report, Facebook hired the senior bank lobbyist in anticipation of the greater regulatory scrutiny in Europe over its plans to launch its own crypto asset and other financial services to its 2.4 billion users. Bowles will join the company in September, and will reportedly be its London-based director of public policy.

Earlier today, news broke that Facebook has allegedly sealed backing from over a dozen firms that include Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber for the aforementioned cryptocurrency project, dubbed “Libra.”

A European Facebook executive recently also reportedly confirmed that a white paper outlining the cryptocurrency’s essentials is set to be published on June 18.

As a Cointelegraph analysis notes, both Facebook and Telegram are examples of major social platforms that have been quietly working on their own native cryptocurrency tokens.

Encrypted instant messaging service Telegram had officially released a test client for its Telegram Open Network (TON) at the end of May. Apart from the TON Lite Client itself, users can now also install a configuration file for smart contract development, which connects the Lite Client to a test server.",,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3402338/apple-may-be-prepping-to-turn-your-iphone-into-a-crypto-wallet.html,"Apple is likely preparing to let iPhone owners turn their devices into hardware wallets that allow them to store and use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for mobile purchases of everything from a cup of coffee to clothing and groceries.

Unlike other announcements at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week, Apple's new CryptoKit for iOS 13, got little attention. But it will allow developers to easily create hashes for digital signatures and public and private keys that can be stored and managed by Apple's Secure Enclave. Those keys, which can represent cryptocurrencies, can then be exchanged by iPhone owners as a form of payment through an app.

Apple did not return a request for comment on CryptoKit and whether it is indeed part of a plan to introduce a cryptocurrency wallet.

If Apple is going down the cryptocurrency path, it would be following HTC and Samsung, who've announced their intention to create native cold storage wallets on their smartphones. HTC last year announced that its Exodus 1 smartphone would be able to natively store bitcoin or Ether cryptocurrencies and Samsung is making a big push for the same feature on its flagship Galaxy 10 phone, expected to arrive in February.

A new study from Juniper Research found that the number of people using digital wallets for all types of currencies is expected to increase from 2.3 billion this year to nearly 4 billion, or 50% of the world’s population, by 2024. This, in turn, will push wallet transaction values up by more than 80% to more than $9 trillion a year. The study argued that increases would be driven by a greater volume of transactions conducted via stored credentials.

The report highlighted the challenge posed to NFC-based contactless wallets, such as Apple Pay and Samsung Pay, by the emergence of wallets based on QR codes. QR codes are already being used by merchants to access cryptocurrency wallets for payment.

At this point, Apple's CryptoKit doesn't include all of the cryptography algorithms, such as the secp256k1 signature algorithm, needed to complete Bitcoin transactions, according to David Huseby, a Security Maven at Hyperledger, the open-source blockchain project under the The Linux Foundation.

""However, the abstracted interface they created makes it easy to add other algorithms in the future,"" Huseby said via email. ""It's the same strategy that Hyperledger Ursa has taken for making cryptographic algorithms 'pluggable.'""

Hyperledger Ursa is a cryptographic library, a repository developers can draw on to easily create a layer of encryption – private and public keys – to increase security for apps.

In the same way, according to Apple, CryptoKit will give iOS app developers a new framework for creating secure hashes for operations like message authentication and secure cryptographic keys.

Viktor Radchenko, founder of Trust Wallet, a cryptocurrency wallet that supports the storage of Ethereum-based tokens, tweeted that CryptoKit means users are just a few steps away from turning their iPhones into a hardware wallet.

Kyle Ellicott, chief labs officer for research firm ReadWrite Lab, agreed with Radchenko: CryptoKit means Apple's giving developers the ability to build blockchain or crypto-based apps – and it puts Apple in a unique position when it comes to hardware.

""They'll be able to provide a cold storage, or a more secure crypto wallet than anything else out there right now from a mobile phone standpoint,"" Ellicott said, referring to the existing biometrics capabilities on iPhones and iPads. ""Look what else they talked about at WWDC. They announced the Goldman Sachs payments card and announced huge upgrades to Apple Wallet.""

Apple business partners, including Starbucks and Whole Foods Market and other other retailers, have all announced programs to accept bitcoin other cryptocurrency for payments. A customer merely waves a QR code on their smartphone in front of a register scanner and payment is transferred to the retailer. The QR code, enabled by an app, represents digital currency in a customer's cryptocurrency wallet.

""People need to store [cryptocurrency] and they need to feel a level of comfort with that. Now with the Apple Wallet improving, and these partners using the technology..., the next step is to integrate the two,"" Ellicott said. ""As consumers, we know how to use the wallet; we feel safe because the partners are using as well.""

Apple's CryptoKit and Hyperledger Ursa both seek to improve software that uses cryptography by ensuring app developers don't have to understand the subtle details of using a particular cryptographic implementation. Ursa, however, includes advanced cryptography features such as zero-knowledge proofs for more privacy-oriented applications; Apple's CryptoKit does not, Huseby said.

Because CryptoKit enables a second layer of security through encryption for iOS applications with private and public keys, it can address other issues related to hardware hacking, such as SIM jacking – a malicious attack often used to assume control of a person's digital and financial lives.

""It's another layer of authentication and protection,"" Ellicott said. ""That's why it's a bigger deal than Apple let onto. I don't think they wanted to make too big of a splash because a lot of it came down to them not wanting to seem like they were creating potentially their own cryptocurrency like Facebook. We don't know if they'll have an Apple Coin. It would make sense based on their other strategies.

""And, they don't want to be the ones creating the next Coinbase,"" Ellicott continued. ""They want to empower Coinbase to leverage their technology to further integrate in the Apple ecosystem. That's my interpretation of what I saw.""

Apple is a notoriously quiet company when it comes to talking about future products and services, but it has filed patents related to blockchain; to date, most of those that have been made public relate to ethical sourcing of materials for building devices, such as the iPhone, according to Ellicott.

For example, in February, Apple announced it was helping draft blockchain rules for the Responsible Business Alliance's Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). First reported by VentureBeat, Apple chaired the Alliance and served on the RMI steering committee during 2018.

Ellicott speculated that Cryptokit may be hiding other Apple blockchain patents that, as it's rolled out, will come to light.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bull-trap-bitcoins-price-rise-to-8300-isnt-backed-by-high-volumes,"View

Bitcoin has rallied more than 9 percent in the last nine days, but on low volumes – a sign of low investor confidence. As a result, the gains could be short lived.

The bearish volume divergence indicates BTC could dive out of a “rising wedge” bearish reversal pattern seen on the 4-hour chart.

A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could see a return to $8,000 or lower.

If trading volumes pick up in the next 24 hours, prices may rise above $8,500 over the weekend, validating a bearish channel breakout witnessed earlier this week.

A clear divergence between prices and trading volumes on the charts suggests bitcoin’s (BTC) recent $800 rally could be short-lived.

Prices are currently up more than 9 percent from recent lows near $7,500 on June 6. Notably, BTC revived the short-term bullish outlook with a move above $8,100 on Wednesday. The follow-through has been positive, as well.

Yes, as trading volumes haven’t picked along with the price rise, the breakout lacks substance.

For instance, bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume across all cryptocurrency exchanges currently stands at $19 billion – down 42 percent from the high of $33 billion seen on May 16, according to CoinMarketCap.

More importantly, daily trading volume has averaged roughly $18 billion throughout the recent recovery from $7,500 to $8,300, which is significantly lower than the sell volume of $24 billion and $29 billion seen on May 30 and June 4.

While the wider market is reported to be rife with inflated volumes, the numbers from major exchanges included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real” bitcoin trading volume also show the recent price rise is not backed by big volumes.

The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $8,270 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $8,335 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday.

Daily chart (CoinMarketCap)

Bitcoin’s daily trading volume consistently printed above its 50-day moving average throughout the price rise from $4,000 to $9,000.

However, volume has been sitting below the 50-day average since June 6, putting a question mark on the sustainability of the rally from $7,500 to $8,300.

Daily chart (major exchanges)

As can be seen above left, bitcoin trading volumes on Bitstamp have tapered off significantly over the last 10 days, with volume bars consistently printing lower highs.

Volumes continue to remain low despite the bearish channel breakout witnessed earlier this week – a sign of low investor confidence in the price rise. Further, volume numbers on Coinbase and Bitfinex (above right) paint a similar picture.

That bearish divergence of trading volumes indicates the cryptocurrency may dive out of the rising wedge pattern (above left), confirming an end of the bounce from lows near $7,500.

A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to $8,000. Acceptance below that psychological support would expose recent lows near $7,500.

If trading volumes improve in the next 24 hours, bitcoin will likely rise well above $8,500, validating Wednesday’s falling channel breakout.

Wright, lead brain behind alternative cryptocurrency Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, caused controversy earlier this year after suing community members who refused to acknowledge that he created Bitcoin under the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym.

An eagle-eyed Twitter user shared a clip from Wright’s presentation, in which Wright (hilariously) says the following as part of a “bit.”

… there’s this whole section, I remember some white paper, um, back in 2008, had this section on how identity worked in Bitcoin. I remember reading it… probably when I wrote it... and there was this different way of doing things …

In April, Wright commenced legal action against those who had repeatedly called him a fraud on social media. Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack and Twitter-based cartoon space-cat “Hodlonaut” were the first targets.

Lawyers representing Wright later sent legal notices to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Blocksteam CEO Adam Back, as well as two independent cryptocurrency news outlets.

The letters demanded recipients retract any statements that claim Wright is a fraud, and even appear in court to declare they were wrong to do so all along.

Wright’s ordered to appear in court himself next week over a separate lawsuit lodged by the estate of Dave Kleiman, a computer security expert who (some believe) played a key role in Bitcoin‘s creation.

It’s alleged Wright stole 1.1 million BTC ($9.2 billion) from Kleiman’s estate after he passed away, and must now produce evidence of all the Bitcoin he’s ever mined — which would include at least some of that supposedly stolen cryptocurrency.

In November 2008, someone named Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper. They maintained an online presence until December 2010, when they disappeared from the internet altogether. Bitcoin’s development continues without their input.

Finally, industry players have shared their knowledge with the cryptoverse, and we’ve learned that Coinmine plans to update its crypto-mining device, improving its efficiency and bringing new features, but we’ve also read that digital currencies may greatly benefit from Facebook’s move into the blockchain ‘n’ crypto sphere. Kenetic’s Jehan Chu agrees that semi-centralization is vital, and adds that the company will launch a new, pure equity, venture capital fund, and that Asia is the blockchain generation’s home.

Craig Wright, the notorious Satoshi Nakamoto claimant, must appear in court on Monday or be held in contempt. The Florida court granted a motion to compel on June 14, mandating Wright to provide a list of all the bitcoin addresses he’s owned prior to December 2013.

Craig Wright Must Appear in Florida Court on Monday

A Southern District Court of Florida judge has ordered Craig Wright to appear in Florida on Monday, June 17 or be held in contempt of court. Three days ago, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the barrage of developments in the Kleiman vs. Wright lawsuit. Wright had described a very complex method of splitting keys using a form of Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) algorithm into a blind trust.

The lawsuit started last year in February as the representatives of the now deceased Dave Kleiman believe his inheritance was misappropriated by Wright. Last month Wright was ordered to produce a list of all the bitcoin addresses he owned as of December 2013. However, Wright hasn’t been so forthright with providing these addresses and has explained to the court that methods used in the so-called blind trust make it complicated for him to obtain.

“Dr. Wright does not know the public addresses of the bitcoin held by the trusts (i.e., the bitcoin mined by Dr. Wright in 2009 after block 70, through 2010),” Wright’s attorneys detailed last week.

Then on June 14, the court handed down a motion to compel, which means the plaintiffs found Wright’s prior discovery responses insufficient. The motion to compel tries to force him to answer by using the court as leverage so he will produce his bitcoin address documentation. Stephen Palley, a lawyer who comments frequently on cryptocurrency cases, explained on Twitter that he believes sanctions are coming if Wright doesn’t comply. “Listen, I have no idea who Satoshi is — I can tell you that the court isn’t buying what this guy is selling though and is creating a strong incentive to settle,” Palley added.

Deciding Whether Sanctions Are Warranted

The latest motion gives Wright much less wiggle room as far as being non-compliant is concerned. Being held in contempt could be a punishable offense or make matters worse for his defense. Furthermore, Wright has also been ordered for both a show and cause hearing and a second deposition on June 28. The order on the plaintiff’s motion to compel uses some strong arguments against Wright’s recent blind trust description involving complex encryption and the SSS algorithm. For instance, the order opens with an in-depth description of encryption and notes that the technique has been used since the time of Julius Caesar. Moreover, it highlights that Wright swore that the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and private keys to the bitcoin he mined requires a combination of himself and the blind agreement’s trustees in order to open the SSS algorithm.

The Kleiman estate wants to compel Wright to comply or they will “seek sanctions for his failure to do so.” The plaintiffs then describe how the SSS algorithm works and how Wright conceded to participate voluntarily in this system, which means he should have some basic understanding of the keys he possesses and the members of the blind trust in order to obtain the funds. The motion to compel order states:

[Wright] has not explained why he cannot obtain and has not obtained, the necessary keys from these third parties. At this point, the record before the Court fails to demonstrate that Dr. Wright cannot through reasonable diligence comply with the Court’s March 14th Order. The Court will allow the parties to develop a full evidentiary record before it decides whether sanctions are warranted.

The discussion about Wright’s case has been making the rounds on crypto Twitter and many are curious to see if the case will open up more of this mysterious story. A few digital currency enthusiasts think, however, that Wright’s disciples will believe he is Satoshi no matter how the case turns out.

BSV Cult: ""If Craig wins the Kleiman case, that proves he is Satoshi!"" ""If Craig loses the Kleiman case, that proves he is Satoshi!"" If Craig settles the Kleiman case, that proves he is Satoshi!"" Cult confirmation bias in its fullest form. — Ⓥin Ⓐrmani (@vinarmani) June 14, 2019

Those who don’t trust Wright’s story and think he’s a charlatan are inclined to presume the case may expose him. According to the latest motion to compel, Wright must be physically present in Florida by Monday and explain why he cannot provide a list of addresses. Failure to comply with any of the aforementioned court requests will have consequences either way.

Fintech has become a buzzword for local banks trying to keep up with the change of the times.

The banks, however, are not looking into an important part of blockchain, which is digital assets, says one influential Korean advocate of alternative currency. In order to assess the Korean blockchain space, it is important to understand how the trend affects existing players and the cryptocurrency market.

Blockchain as a ledger

Shinhan Bank, the first bank to be established on the peninsula, incorporated blockchain into its lending services on May 27.

The bank’s “Blockchain Verification System” allows users to receive evidential documents on private enterprises. Through this system, it has shortened the process from two to three days to almost instant verification.

KB Kookmin Bank, one of the largest banks in the country, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with blockchain firm Atomrigs Lab, as Cointelegraph reported June 11. The partnership is designed to explore digital asset management and protection solutions.

What differentiates Atomrigs Labs from other blockchain developers is that it specializes in the financial sector and is known to have the technology to retrieve private keys in case of loss.

The latest move is part of KB Kookmin’s strategic blueprint to make the promotion of digital transformation a priority. Last year, the bank announced it will focus on technological improvements using the acronym “ABCDE” — standing for artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud, data and ecosystem.

KB Kookmin has also signed an MoU with LG Corp., and is currently developing a joint product currently being called Magok Pay. The nickname comes from where the LG Science Park is located in Seoul.

The payment system using LG CNS’ technology, the IT subsidiary of the umbrella company, is aimed at allowing users to pay with tokens on their smartphones without cash or a bank card.

In turn, the retail lender will pay the amount and manage the transactions in fiat. It was ranked the world’s 60th-largest bank in 2017 based on Tier 1 Capital.

Since April, NH Savings Bank started offering a peer-to-peer financial certificate service, which aims to prevent the tampering of records of receivable principal and interest. More recently, it has also opened a new training course to some of its workforce to groom them to be well-versed in digital ledger systems.

The bank is an extension of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation’s financial operations and serves some 20 million customers.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Sung-jung Kim, the head of Asia for Cindicator — an analytics provider of traditional and digital assets using collective intelligence and machine learning models based in Seoul, St. Petersburg and New York — said the recent race to blockchain adoption by Korean retail banks can be categorized into either the institutions developing their own private blockchains or searching for hybrid options that are already available in the market. According to Kim:

“The Korean economy is heavily dependent on a few large institutions within the nation and as these institutions continue their pursuit for appropriate blockchain solution, we expect more resources to be deployed to enrich the blockchain landscape, especially towards domestic projects.”

It is worth noting both KB Kookmin and NH Savings bank came under regulatory scrutiny last year from Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS). In its joint review of the banks, the financial watchdog criticized their management of cryptocurrency transactions in regard to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

The FSS is Korea’s integrated banking regulator that examines and supervises private lenders under the oversight of the Financial Services Commission.

KEB Hana Bank, another household name, began offering its blockchain-based payment system called Global Royalty Network — or GLN — in Taiwan in April.

Later this year, the bank also plans to issue debit cards that double as ID cards to university students.

Using the digital ledger, the reissuing duration will be shortened to three days from the current three weeks, in case of loss. Korea University students will be the first beneficiaries of this service.

Woori Bank is also working to launch a blockchain-based international wire transfer service. The bank already has a strong presence in India and China and is now working with the Japanese bank consortium SBI Ripple Asia to prepare a pilot.

Shadow over cryptocurrency continues

Despite these developments, there has been a lack of interest in using the technology for settlement, payment and the use of cryptocurrency.

One of Korea’s biggest crypto influencers, Hyun-sik Choi, better known as Soso to his 40,000 viewers and subscribers, believes more needs to be done:

“Korean banks are jumping into the blockchain field. While this proves there is huge interest in the technology from traditional finance, all the attempts are on the tech side. They are ignoring the cryptocurrency part.”

The longtime crypto advocate explained there are two main reasons.

The government separates cryptocurrency from the blockchain technology and only supports the latter. A smaller but definitely noticeable part is that some companies use the term blockchain more as a marketing tool rather than a real solution.

Cindicator’s Kim is hopeful the technology’s overall adoption by traditional market participants can bring about desired influence to digital money:

“We view this as a positive development for the Korean crypto market. These developments can also be seen in the light of the high interest the Korean population has in crypto assets, probably leading to banks wanting to participate in the potential boom.”

From hoodies to suits

With the spike in blockchain adoption by traditional financial institutions comes the change in the players’ demographic.

On June 11, the Korea Blockchain Association announced its nomination of Gap-soo Oh, former deputy governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, as its next chairman. He is scheduled to be sworn in on June 24 during a general meeting.

As Cointelegraph has reported, 70-year-old Oh is now serving as the president of the Global Finance Society, and previously worked as deputy chief of the Standard Chartered Bank Korea, and as an external director at KB Kookmin Bank.

In recent months, more former civil servants and traditional bankers have switched over to digital assets. Crypto watchers in the country are welcoming this trend.

Jun-heon Hwang — better known for his blog Coin Student — says the merging of traditional and digital finance worlds is part of a wider trend across the globe:

“Overseas, traditional financial firms have already entered the digital assets market and that includes its workforce. There are enough young CEOs in the space. To systemize blockchain incorporation, onboarding of established bankers and civil servants in this sector is not only inevitable but necessary.”

Following the money — in fiat

The strong inclination to adopt the new technology comes on the back of staunch support from Seoul.

The government of South Korea nearly doubled its projected spending on blockchain development for selected cities around the country for this calendar year from the same period last year.

In 2018, the government allocated less than 4 billion Korean won ($3.4 million) to seven blockchain projects. For this year, the allocation was expanded to a dozen projects for 8.5 billion Korean won ($7.17 million).

Whether the support for the ledger side of blockchain technology will eventually lead to a trickle-down effect on cryptocurrency in the future in South Korea remains to be seen.

For now, all eyes are on how Korean buyers will affect the global market if — or when — the government relaxes its regulations on digital assets. If the East Asian country’s influence on the price of major coins is any indication, domestic buyers are expected move with unforeseen alacrity.",,https://www.coindesk.com/its-fatfs-way-or-the-highway-for-crypto-exchanges-thats-a-big-mistake,"Serhii Mokhniev, CAMS, is a regulatory affairs counsel at CEX.IO, a London-based bitcoin exchange.

In a few weeks, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is expected to adopt a proposal to impose the standards of wire transfers on blockchain transactions.

Despite concerns raised at a private sector consultative forum in Vienna, Austria, last month, the intergovernmental organization appears set on applying the “travel rule,” which means information on payer and payee must be included in any on-chain transaction.

The problem is, blockchains, in most cases, are not designed in this manner, and thus may be deemed non-compliant by design.

To put it bluntly, these requirements would be pointless at best – when not impossible to follow.

But don’t take my word for it. Listen to what a law enforcement expert has to say.

“Identifying owners of non-custodial wallets in majority cases simply cannot be done by private companies with reasonable certainty,” said Jarek Jakubcek, a strategy analyst at Europol, the European Union law enforcement agency. “Thus, mandating businesses to do something that cannot be done is an exercise in futility.”

Identifying owners who send transactions from one identified party to another is feasible, assuming that tracing tools “correctly cluster and identify the entities (which they frequently do not),” Jakubcek told me. Of course, this would entail restricting user privacy, and allowing businesses to exchange sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) with one another.

And to what purpose? “The majority of exchange-to-exchange transactions are related to trading activities that are naturally not criminal,” said Jakubcek, “so reallocating compliance resources at a high number of relatively low-risk transactions will move the emphasis away from flagging criminal transactions to focusing on low-risk transactions, which will naturally hurt crime prevention.”

As a result, he said:

“The only benefit for the exchange will be a formal check in a compliance checkbox.”

If Jakubcek is right, a substantial part of crypto transactions will move to the underworld, leaving law enforcement and financial intelligence units with nothing, except the trace of transactions.

(Un)expected implications

If the proposal is adopted, FATF’s member countries will eventually require all Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) to do the same as other financial institutions do — to transmit information in one way or another.

Thereby, there would be several implications:

VASP would need to ask the sender of a virtual asset transfer to provide information on the identity of the recipient.

Whenever a virtual asset transfer is performed on behalf of a customer the VASP would need to be able to establish if the target address is being controlled by another VASP. Therefore, the sender would either also have to provide the name of the VASP controlling the target address or there would need to be some kind of a register that attributes all existing custodial wallet crypto addresses to their corresponding VASP.

Furthermore, this information would need to be transmitted to the VASP controlling the target address.

Many industry representatives attended the FATF Forum to receive clarification on this proposal and its implications. (I went as a delegate of the Blockchain and Virtual Currency Working Group, or BVCWG.) Several questions have been brought forward:

How exactly would a VASP determine if a certain crypto address is controlled by a VASP?

How can a VASP verify the information about the identity of the beneficiary of a virtual asset transfer, especially if the target address is not controlled by a VASP?

How exactly should the exchange of information between the VASP of the sender and that of the beneficiary take place?

How do we secure customer privacy?

The FATF has not addressed these questions, and delegates got the perception that nobody knows the solution for being compliant under the proposed rule.

Mission not accomplished

FATF’s attempt to apply an outdated instrument to a new vehicle is just the tip of the iceberg, however. The core issue is with the travel rule itself. Nowadays it barely serves its aims.

The recommendation, first issued in October 2001 following the 9/11 attacks, was intended to prevent terrorists and other criminals from having unfettered access to wire transfers for moving their funds and to detect such misuse by law enforcement and financial institutions when it occurs.

But in practice, the payer/payee data is either modified or not accessible to law enforcement at all.

Let’s take a look at “wire stripping.” In plain English, this is when a bank employee willfully and knowingly changes the information on originator and/or beneficiary in the funds’ transfer message, usually sent via the SWIFT messaging service in cross-border payments. No criminals, sanctioned entities or countries are formally involved in the transaction, though in reality, they are.

In the last decade, this practice has cost banks such as Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank and UniCredit S.p.A hundreds of millions in fines to U.S. regulators.

Moreover, it demonstrates that the current approach — checking names and addresses of payers/payees — does not prevent the bad actors from getting their money.

So what is the solution?

In 2018 the U.S. government surprised compliance specialists by adding bitcoin addresses tied to two Iranian persons to the sanctions list. It appeared possible and feasible to attribute blockchain addresses for the purpose of further sanctions checks.

The response from the industry was immediate: the next day blockchain analytics services added the listed addresses to their databases, and the same day everyone who uses their services got the ability to see (on the blockchain) the sanctioned funds and trace them, to the degree previously not available to investigators.

The existing rule was drafted with the idea that the funds transfers require intermediaries and instructions in the form of messages which allow identifying the parties.

Now, the value can be transferred peer-to-peer, without the intervention of intermediaries — correspondent banks, international payment systems, other clearing venues. It sounds blatant, but peering networks are here to stay.

Of course, they brought freedoms, sometimes uncontrolled (and uncontrollable), but they also brought accountability — in the form of transparency, which, in case of financial transactions, means traceability. So, in the ideal blockchain world, anybody will know what everyone owns.

I believe the solution will be found somewhere in between. If we demonstrate that sanctions can be effectively managed through funds tracing rather than applying the overloading screening process on both ends, we will succeed.

Now, in the latest effort to entwine its systems still further into the everyday lives of its users, Facebook wants to get into your wallet.

On Tuesday, the social media behemoth is expected to reveal its own cryptocurrency, which has variously been called Libra and GlobalCoin. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies, the new creation will not have been founded in the spirit of libertarianism, outside the backing of established, conventional authorities. Instead, it appears to have the endorsement of more than 12 corporations, from Uber to PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.

Since they have risen to prominence over the past decade, cryptocurrencies have conjured up visions of a wild west of finance, where values fluctuate wildly and terrorists and drug dealers come piling in.

Facebook’s new venture appears to be somewhat removed from that image. Reports suggest that the new currency will be overseen by a group of companies that have each invested some $10m to join a consortium and administer it.

Another indication that the Facebook currency will be different from its predecessors is the fact that it will be pegged to a number of government-issued currencies, in a bid to avoid the vast value fluctuations that have dogged other digital currencies.

That inconsistency in valuation is best illustrated by the price of Bitcoin, which was initially sold for a few cents before it reached a record high of just under $20,000 per coin in December 2017. Each one now sells for just over $8,300.

The Facebook project is expected to cost $1bn and has been in development for a year. It should enable Facebook’s 2.4 billion monthly users to change dollars and other international currencies into its digital coins. The currency can then be used to buy goods on the internet – and in shops and other outlets – or to transfer money, without the need for a bank account.

Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, met the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, last month to talk about his plans, and has also discussed the matter with US Treasury officials.

“Payments is one of the areas where we have an opportunity to make it a lot easier,” Zuckerberg told the company’s developer conference in April.

“I believe it should be as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a photo.”

It is expected that Facebook will aim to shatter the poor image of cryptocurrencies, which were initially widely used by criminals to make transactions on the dark web.

It has been reported that Facebook will not directly control the currency but that some members of the consortium will act as “nodes” within the system that can give the green light to transactions.

Reports also suggest that hotels website Booking.com and the payments technology company Stripe have signed up. It is expected that Facebook will release a briefing on the new cryptocurrency this week.

Concerns have been raised, however, that regulatory issues and Facebook’s hitherto poor track record on data privacy and protection are likely to prove major hurdles on the way to making any cryptocurrency a success.

Slovenia has a population of just 2 million but contains more retail locations accepting bitcoin cash payments than the entire United States. What makes this small country such a cryptocurrency adoption leader? Watch the following video to find out.

Slovenia: The Crypto Country

A short new documentary on Bitcoin.com’s Youtube channel highlights the thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem in Slovenia. The video features some of the places where you can pay with bitcoin cash (BCH), different Slovenian startups developing technologies for the market, as well as Roger Ver going shopping to test out the country’s now famous crypto-friendly locales.

One of the major factors in making Slovenia an international cryptocurrency adoption hub is its welcoming regulatory attitude. The documentary shows that not only is the possession of digital assets legal in Slovenia, but capital income from trading cryptocurrency is not subject to income tax for individuals.

In addition, the country’s political leadership is open and receptive to innovation, as shown in the video by the former Prime Minister Miro Cerar. All this makes the country particularly attractive to entrepreneurs in the growing digital asset industry.

Solving the Enigma

According to the documentary, the single biggest reason hundreds of Slovenian retail locations have begun accepting cryptocurrency payments is Eligma. This is the startup that developed Elipay, a transaction processing system that enables in-shop mobile purchases with BCH, BTC, ETH and its own ELI token.

The prime example of this comes from a giant shopping center called BTC City, in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana, where many of the stores now accept cryptocurrency payments through the Elipay system. It shows that there is a growing trend for actual usage in Slovenia, as the number of Elipay wallet users already exceeds 15,000. The video also mentions that the Elipay system now accepts payments from the Bitcoin.com Wallet app, allowing the owners of the more than 4 million user-generated wallets to make in-store purchases in supporting locations.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies had come scaringly close to breaking down below the $100 billion mark in mid-December of last year. At that time, sentiment was very weak and every rally was being sold on. There were talks of cryptocurrencies never seeing their lifetime highs again.

However, fast forward seven months and total market capitalization is inching towards the $300 billion mark. Every dip is being bought aggressively and a few cryptocurrencies have already gone on to make new highs. The sentiment has changed within a short span of time.

While the underlying fundamentals had been improving throughout 2018, a few notable events have helped to speed up the recovery of 2019. One among them is the launch of Facebook’s secretive cryptocurrency, Libra. The company is expected to announce the list of the Libra Association founding members and launch the testnet of its blockchain on June 18.

Along with Facebook’s crypto project, the markets are also eagerly awaiting the launch of TON, the blockchain platform being developed by messaging app Telegram. With Bakkt having announced a date for bitcoin futures testing in June, hopes are high that the platform will also soon start operations. Unless these events fail to live up to expectations, a sharp fall is unlikely. Let’s look at the top five performers among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days.

NEO/USD

Neo (NEO) co-founder Da Hongfei had recently announced a new $100 million EcoBoost fund that aims to provide support to various projects at different stages of development to build the NEO ecosystem. The first phase of the project has kicked off wherein official partners will be recruited.

The recent upgrade of its consensus algorithm on its mainnet is a key step in the development of NEO 3.0, which is expected to be released by the second quarter of next year. Can these developments prop prices higher? Let’s find out.

The NEO/USD pair has not shown any fireworks in its rise from the bottom. After every small upwards move, it enters into consolidation before rising again. This looks like an accumulation by stronger hands. The price has sustained above 20-week EMA for the past three weeks and the RSI has rallied into the positive territory, which shows that bulls are in command.

Currently, the pair is facing stiff resistance at the 50-week SMA, above which the rally can extend to $20. If this level is also crossed, a move to $25 is probable. The cryptocurrency will pick up momentum if it makes a large range move and follows it up with further gains. Traders can watch for such a move before hopping on to benefit from the positive momentum.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from the current level and plummets below the 20-week EMA. The next support to watch on the downside is $8.17090666.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has continued to perform well on the back of its upcoming halving, which is 50 days away. In a sign of growing adoption, Glory kickboxing is not only accepting litecoin, but it is also offering an opportunity to pick up a VIP ticket by paying using the cryptocurrency. This adoption is a positive sign. However, after the runup, is it time to book profits or can it move higher? Let’s find out.

The digital currency has cleared the resistance line of the ascending channel and is now attempting to ascend the overhead resistance at $140.3450. If successful, it can rally to its target objective of $158.91, above which the upward move can extend to $184.7940.

We have spotted a large rounding bottom that is developing on the LTC/USD pair. This bullish setup will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $184.7940, with a target objective of $346.498. However, we will not get overly bullish until the pattern completes.

The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI has entered into the overbought zone, which shows that the bulls are in command. Nonetheless, the overbought nature of the RSI points to a mild correction or a consolidation in the short-term.

If the pair turns down from the current levels or from $140.3450, the bulls will try to defend the support line of the ascending channel. If successful, the uptrend will continue, otherwise, the pair might re-enter the channel. The uptrend will weaken and our bullish projections will be negated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the support line of the channel.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) is on fire as every dip is being bought aggressively. Some of the critical news and events that might be helping the rise are the upcoming testing of futures trading on the Bakkt platform, the end of the bear market, the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S., the reported launch of Facebook’s own stablecoin, etc. Can the rally continue and force the investors sitting on the sidelines to jump in, or will the rally fizzle out near the overhead resistance? Let’s find out.

The BTC/USD pair is looking strong with the 20-week EMA sloping up and the RSI in overbought territory: this suggests that bulls are in command. The pair has broken out of the recent high at $9,053.12 and will now attempt to reach the next overhead resistance of $10,000. This is a psychological resistance where we anticipate a consolidation or a minor correction.

However, the sentiment has become positive and any favorable news is likely to attract buyers. The traders who are waiting to buy at lower levels are feeling left out. Hence, if the bulls propel the price above $10,000, the momentum can pick up and can carry the pair to $12,000.

Currently, there is no negative setup on the chart. The first indication of exhaustion will be if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below $7,413.46. That can drag the price towards the 20-week EMA and below it to the critical support of $5,900.

ETH/USD

Enigma released the testnet of its discovery network and the developers can now build decentralized applications that can be deployed immediately once Enigma goes live on the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet . In a first, Coinbase has also added a course on the Ethereum-based stablecoin dai (DAI) to its Coinbase Earn platform. This provides an opportunity for enthusiasts to know more about the token and earn some DAI. Can ether breakout of the overhead resistance and head higher?

The ETH/USD pair is consolidating roughly between $225 and $300 for the past three weeks. This is a positive sign as it shows demand close to $225. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, which indicates a change in trend.

The longer the consolidation, the stronger the eventual breakout from it will be. If the bulls push the price above $307.67, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the pair to $500, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.

Our bullish assumption will prove to be wrong if the bears defend the overhead resistance zone of $280 to $307.67 and sink the cryptocurrency below the moving averages.

XMR/USD

A web address is spreading a botnet that installs a monero (XMR) mining component and also holds DDoS capabilities, according to cybersecurity firm Trend Micro. However, in a positive for monero, the CEO of Binance tweeted that if India pushes through the crypto bill, the crypto enthusiasts of the country might shift to privacy coins.

The XMR/USD pair has been consolidating between $81 and $100 for the past three weeks, which is a positive sign. The price has sustained above both moving averages, which are likely to complete a bullish crossover. This will indicate a change in trend.

If the bulls push the price above $100, a rally to $150 in the medium-term is probable. It is unlikely to be a straight dash to this level as the cryptocurrency might face minor hiccups at $114.840 and $128.650. However, if the sentiment remains positive, these levels will be crossed.

The first sign of weakness will be a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below $81. That can drag the price lower to the 20-week EMA and below it to $60.147.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-billionaires-cameron-and-tyler-winklevoss-gemini/,"Their names are Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, identical twins and Olympic athletes, famously portrayed in the film ""The Social Network"" as a privileged pair of handsome Harvard jocks who believed nerdy classmate Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook.

Of their portrayal in the 2010 film, Tyler Winklevoss said, ""They were a bit stiff and maybe not full-dimensional.""

Cameron added, ""Those characters are interesting, but they're not really us.""

The Winklevoss twins are back in the spotlight again, this time as very successful investors in bitcoin, having turned their $65 million Facebook settlement into many hundreds of millions of dollars.

Cryptocurrency entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. CBS News

Cameron said, ""If you believe that bitcoin is the beginning of the internet of money, you can actually buy a piece of it. Anybody in the world can. And there's tons of people who have made a lot buying a piece of that future.""

And there is a nearly equal amount who have lost a lot.

Ben Mezrich wrote the book on which ""The Social Network"" movie was based. A decade later, news that the Winklevoss twins has gambled big, and won, by investing in bitcoin got his attention: ""It made me start to think that they weren't at the helm of two revolutions by accident.""

For him, the Winklevosses' second act was too good to pass up. Mezrich said, ""They're wealthy, they're Greek gods essentially. They've got everything anyone could think one would need. Why don't they just row off into the sunset?""

Flatiron Books

Indeed, the ""Winklevii"" did seem to have everything: Pretty girls, private planes, invitations to all the best parties. Why did two guys – Olympic athletes raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, educated at Harvard and Oxford – gamble it all on something as slippery and nearly incomprehensible as bitcoin?

As Mezrich sees it, because of Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, all over again. ""They go out to Silicon Valley to become venture capitalists, and nobody wants their money 'cause everyone's end game is to sell your company to Facebook,"" he said. ""And because Zuckerberg hates the Winklevoss twins so much, that becomes an impossibility.

""So, they head to Ibiza – as one does, right? – and someone walks up to them and pitches the idea of bitcoin.""

Correspondent Nicholas Thompson asked the twins to set the scene on Ibiza in 2012: ""Somebody tells you about this thing: Currency that can be sent like email. It's all based on math. You don't have to trust a banker or a president. You just have to trust the code. And then you make a big decision, which is to buy 1% of all of the bitcoins in the world?""

""Yeah, you know, some people they might dive off a diving board. I think in this case we took a cannonball off the diving board,"" Cameron laughed.

The price of a bitcoin then was in the high single digits, $8 or $9 a coin. It's now trading about $9,000 a coin, down from $20,000 at its peak.

[Thompson noted that he does not invest in it, and wouldn't advise his mom to, either.]

Tyler said, ""Our thesis at the time was, bitcoin's going to disrupt gold. And gold has a market cap of $7 trillion today. So, if bitcoin's gonna be worth $7 trillion or more, this seems like a cheap asset.""

""A cheap asset being sold on a place where people sell Magic cards!"" said Thompson, ""as opposed to, like, in a bank.""

""That was the state of play back then. It was complete wild west,"" Tyler said.

The wild west … currency free of government oversight or regulation – the perfect place for all kinds of illicit behavior. Thompson said, ""It's a bunch of people who are anarchists, who want to smash the state, whose identities aren't known, who are selling drugs, right? Your early business partner goes to jail for multiple years.""

""That's exactly what informed us in what not to do, and what had to change,"" said Tyler.

If you don't understand the virtual currency bitcoin, you're not alone. ""It's hard to digest it all at once,"" said Tyler.

Bitcoin is an asset that travels on the bitcoin network. By buying a bitcoin, you are buying a piece in the bitcoin ledger that represents a fixed digital asset. ""It's like buying a bar of gold, but there's no physical component to it,"" said Tyler.

Thompson said, ""So, you're buying a bar of gold, but it's not a bar of gold. It's just a bunch of numbers. So there's a giant ledger, that's worth a certain amount of money that changes over time.""

""Exactly,"" said Cameron.

The twins point out most people don't know how the internet works either, but we all use it.

""This is money that works like your email,"" Tyler said. ""And that was the Ah-ha! moment for us.""

Easy to use, fast, sounds great! Cameron added, ""I think I turned to Tyler and said, 'Hey, this is either the next big thing, or total BS!""

Thompson asked, ""Was there a moment in the Wild West period you guys looked at each other and said, 'What are we doing? Let's just get out, and go back to what most of the people from Greenwich and Harvard are doing,' which is working at a hedge fund instead of betting on this crazy stuff?""

""Instead of looking at it and saying 'Let's get out,' we said, 'Let's get in more,'"" Tyler replied. ""And that's when we started to fund Gemini.""

Getting the average person excited about bitcoin is one of the aims of Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange the brothers are launching. Their offices occupy 50,000 square feet on New York's Park Avenue South, where some 200 employees are working hard to make bitcoin as easy to buy and sell as possible.

And though there are other bitcoin exchanges with a lot more traffic than Gemini, the brothers hope their app will encourage regular people to get their feet wet.

Thompson easily purchased $10 worth of bitcoin using his phone. But there are lots of risks, and fees. Turning around and selling his bitcoin, it turned out, cost Thompson: ""Man, I lost $2.09 with you guys!"" Thompson said.

""You shoulda held!"" Tyler replied.

Later this week, the twins' old nemesis, Facebook, will announce a cryptocurrency launch of its own, called Libra. The brothers say they're not worried. ""There's so much pie to grow, I mean, at this point, we need to be frenemies,"" Cameron said.

""But Facebook has entered a lot of markets with pie to grow, and usually it eats the pie,"" said Thompson.

""I think this pie is different,"" Tyler said.

""One possible scenario with Facebook would be they come in and they change things in a way that hurts Gemini, but that also validates things and drives the price of bitcoin way up. So, you guys lose your company but make a ton more money. How does that feel?""

""We should hire you to come in and war game with us!"" Tyler laughed.

As to how it's all going to play out? We may just have to wait for the next movie.

Story produced by Mary Lou Teel.",,https://www.coindesk.com/hype-or-hope-a-meeting-of-the-minds-for-the-benefit-of-crypto,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in cryptoassets, with news and views on crypto infrastructure delivered every Tuesday. Sign up here.

Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, has paid $4.57 million for the privilege of having lunch with legendary investor Warren Buffett.

News outlets around the world picked up this news, trumpeting it as yet another example of how ridiculous the crypto sector can be.

The gesture is attention-grabbing, true, and not just because $4.57 million is a lot to pay for a meal and a couple of hours of someone’s time. It’s also worthy of a jaw drop given Buffett’s public opinion of bitcoin: “probably rat poison squared” is one of his more colourful descriptions.

However, the real event here is being overlooked. Thanks to Sun’s largesse, two extremes of the current investment landscape will sit at the same table and talk to each other. This is more significant than most of us realise.

A rich buffet

First, let’s look at the extremes that these two ambassadors represent.

Warren Buffett is CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a U.S.-based conglomerate with over $700 billion in assets, including a handful of large enterprises in insurance, transport and consumer goods, a portfolio of minority holdings in household names such as Coca Cola and Wells Fargo, a sizeable equity portfolio, and over $110 billion of cash equivalents.

One of the richest men in the world, Buffett made his fortune investing in solid companies with definable markets and tangible profits. He has often said that he doesn’t invest in businesses he doesn’t understand, and it wasn’t until 2011 that he took his first stake in a tech company, IBM, a position that did not do well. In 2017, he bought shares in Apple, which now accounts for the largest position in his equity portfolio. And last month, he revealed a small holding in Amazon.

At the other end of the table, we have Justin Sun, an experienced entrepreneur and former Ripple representative, who has built a large ecosystem around a global entertainment platform based on a distributed storage blockchain. Not exactly in Buffett’s wheelhouse, especially since the main use case so far seems to be for gambling, something Buffett has spoken out against in the past.

Tron has been criticized for its outlandish publicity stunts, questionable governance and even plagiarism. In spite of that, however, the network’s token TRX has amassed a liquid market cap of over $2 billion, placing it in the top 10 of crypto assets.

Can you think of two more different lunch partners?

Round table

Now let’s pick our jaws up off the floor and look at what this meeting represents.

On the one hand, it’s a master publicity stunt for Tron and could well end up being cheap at the price. Sun’s name has since graced headlines in mainstream press around the world. While the tone of the reporting may be of incredulity and perhaps even scorn, his name has appeared in the same sentence as Buffett’s in every single article. The two are now associated in the minds of not just investors who read the financial press, but also of a good part of the world’s population.

On the other hand, it’s also good publicity for Buffett, not that he needs it. Affectionately referred to in many outlets as “America’s favorite capitalist,” Buffett has come under criticism recently for his underperformance of the S&P500 over the past 10 years, in spite of handsome outperformance for the previous 30, and for having totally missed the tech boom.

With this lunch, the proceeds of which will go to charity, Buffett has shown himself to be gracious and generous. Several well-known commentators tut-tutted that they wouldn’t want to be in his shoes, but Buffett issued a public statement through a spokesperson saying that he was looking forward to the opportunity. Buffett is far from stupid and may well be intrigued by the chance to hear about a totally foreign concept from one of its most high-profile promoters.

This brings us to where this meeting might lead.

Take out

No-one expects Buffett to emerge from the meal a converted crypto evangelist. If he has struggled to understand tech companies (as he puts it) and their focus on revenue growth at the expense of profits, then it’s very unlikely he will appreciate the value in a new type of asset that has no tangible backing, no defined governance and no established income streams.

Nor will it produce a Buffett-backed investment in crypto, even as an experiment. Berkshire Hathaway is a public company and its annual general meeting is a massive event, with over 40,000 people travelling from far and wide to question the board on their investment decisions. Imagine them having to justify putting shareholders’ money into “magic internet beans.”

What’s more, Buffett has in the past highlighted how hard it is to find viable investments with so much money on hand. The number of listed equities in which he could feasibly invest is limited to around 100, simply because of liquidity concerns and operational considerations.

With over $700 billion of assets under management and over $100 billion of “dry powder” (cash that needs to find a profitable home), even a $1 billion investment that produces a 500% return in one year won’t be enough to “move the needle” on the portfolio’s overall performance. Smaller investments, no matter how enticing, are not worth the hassle. And a larger investment in even the most liquid of crypto assets would send the market reeling – not something a smart investor would do.

Leave a tip

The ideal outcome of the lunch is actually the most likely: that Buffett is less dismissive of the concept of crypto assets than before.

This is likely because Buffett recognizes that he has made mistakes in dismissing entire sectors before. “We blew it,” is how he explained his lack of tech investments so far. Given his personal emphasis on lifelong education, we can expect him to at least listen to Sun.

And it won’t just be to Sun. The entrepreneur’s bold statements, confusing business strategy and apparent lack of concern for regulatory issues (see the interview our editor-in-chief Pete Rizzo did with him on the main stage at Consensus 2019) will most likely mean that Buffett won’t take him very seriously. But Sun is allowed to invite seven other guests and will hopefully choose ones that can explain crypto assets’ role in the evolution of finance with clarity and sobriety. Virtually all of Crypto Twitter has been jostling for position.

Sun is likely to choose well, since association with leading crypto thinkers is part of the stunt. While the rest of us will fantasize about being a fly on that wall, we can be fairly confident that the conversation will be both dense and conceptual.

We can also marvel at the genius of the idea. Whatever you may think of Sun, Tron and the outlook for decentralized entertainment, there is no way that this move doesn’t help the crypto sector. Worst case, Buffett is unmoved and continues to think bitcoin is a “delusion.” From what I gather, his opinion could not go lower than it already is.

Best case, Buffett emerges with an acknowledgement, however reluctant, that maybe there’s more to this than he realized. That would send a strong signal to institutional investors everywhere that dismissal without at least some investigation is short-sighted and foolish.

Total victory would be for Warren Buffett to publicly recognize that he doesn’t understand enough about cryptocurrency to have an informed opinion… yet.

Following widespread reports of the upcoming Indian cryptocurrency bill, the crypto community has started a petition for the government to quickly implement a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. In addition, a television network operated by the Upper House of the Indian Parliament has aired a program discussing the bill, and three Right to Information requests have been filed seeking answers about the bill.

Petition to Accelerate Crypto Regulation

Since details of India’s “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019” have emerged, there have been constant discussions about this bill, what it entails, and whether it is the bill that will be submitted to the finance minister. While two prominent local publications have claimed to possess information about the bill, many unanswered questions remain.

In an effort to stop speculation and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt), Blockchain Lawyer founder Varun Sethi started a petition on Change.org on June 15 to the Department of Economic Affairs and the country’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Anyone can sign the petition entitled “Implementing Regulatory Framework for Cryptoassets in India” and possibly help shape the crypto regulation in the country. At press time, 1,437 have signed the petition.

“This petition is neither sponsored by any specific blockchain or cryptoasset company / exchange / group in any manner whatsoever nor has any compensation being received from anyone to initiate such petition,” the petition reads:

The purpose of this petition is to engage the blockchain community and the government in a more democratic and engaging environment to accelerate the implementation of regulatory framework regarding blockchain and cryptoassets in India and relinquish the ambiguity which has developed around it.

“India is home to 2.7 million tech developers which is expected to grow to 5.2 million in [the] next 48 months,” Sethi began. He referenced the banking restriction imposed by the central bank in April last year as well as the Right to Information (RTI) request he filed, which revealed that the RBI did not do any research before implementing the banking ban on crypto businesses.

Sethi also outlined other countries’ crypto regulatory efforts such as Japan, Malta, Canada, Estonia, Germany, and Norway, “to better regulate and tap the potential of this technology.” The lawyer proceeded to make some suggestions for India such as officially defining terms like blockchain and crypto assets, providing a regulatory sandbox for new crypto assets to be tested in, registering initial coin offerings, defining KYC/AML guidelines, and updating the Foreign Exchange Management Act and the Income Tax Act to report crypto income. He concluded:

The success of the petition shall be when the government issues guidelines for a democratic regulatory framework for blockchain and cryptoassets entities in India, perhaps on the suggestions stated above.

India’s cryptocurrency bill was drafted by an interministerial committee headed by Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs. The committee was tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrency and making recommendations for its legal framework. Garg recently said that the report containing the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency was ready to be submitted to the finance minister.

Parliament TV Discusses the Ban Proposal

As speculation rises about what India’s cryptocurrency bill contains, Rajya Sabha TV (RSTV), a television network channel owned and operated by Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Parliament of India, aired its latest episode of Policy Watch Friday on the government’s decision to propose a ban on cryptocurrency. Policy Watch is a weekly show featuring discussions of national economic policies. Guests on the Friday episode included Mohd. Haleem Khan, a former secretary, Ministry of Finance.

In the show, Khan explained to anchor Kriti Mishra:

The issuance of currencies is a sovereign act … any currencies issued by anybody else comes to that level of counterfeit currency.

Mishra asked Khan about the 10-year jail sentence for “Whoever directly or indirectly mines, generates, holds, sells, deals in, transfers, disposes of or issues cryptocurrency or any combination thereof,” which according to Bloombergquint, “shall be punishable with fine as may be prescribed by the central government in the first schedule or with imprisonment which shall not be less than one year but which may extend up to ten years, or both.”

Khan described that there is a provision even today for a 10-year prison sentence for counterfeiting currencies. He further explained that another law that comes into play is the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) before concluding: “I don’t find anything wrong with this approach.”

Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, commented on the Policy Watch episode:

If you hear the anchor, she’s reading out exact word to word from Bloomberg article … So let’s not assume this is confirmation.

India’s cryptocurrency bill will first need to be submitted to the finance minister for approval and introduced in Lok Sabha, the Lower House of Parliament. If approved, the bill will move to the Upper House of Parliament. Even if it’s signed into law, anyone can still go to court and challenge the constitutional validity of the law.

3 Confusing RTI Replies

At least three recent RTI requests have been filed regarding the bill to ban cryptocurrency: one with the Department of Economic Affairs, one with the central bank, and one with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

The first of the three was filed by the founder of local news outlet Coin Crunch India on April 26, one day after the Economic Times published its article on the bill. “On May 20, 2019, DEA rejected the RTI application citing ‘Section 8(1)(i)’ as the reason for rejection,” the publication shared, adding that “This could mean that DEA simply rejected it because eventually the information has to be made public.”

The second RTI, filed by Sethi, reveals some interesting facts such as how the central bank did not have any knowledge of this bill and did not propose a ban on cryptocurrency. “RBI has actually stated that they have not received any communication from any department and they have also not given any communication to any government department pertaining to [the] drafting of this bill and this is very surprising,” Sethi explained. The third RTI was filed by a journalist at Crypto News India. The IRDA’s reply was short and swift; it says no information was available on the matter.

With so much speculation and misinformation floating around the cryptosphere, the crypto community is awaiting the government to make an official announcement regarding the bill. Further, the supreme court is expected to address India’s regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and the banking restriction on July 23.

Notably, government agents and state-controlled businesses were vocal about their interest in blockchain, but seemed to distance themselves from digital tokens.

Meanwhile, the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies is still missing in the country, despite the fact that local authorities have been tasked to prepare the needed amendment a while ago. So, where is Russia heading in terms of crypto and blockchain?

Brief introduction to Russia’s relationship with cryptocurrencies

Russia’s stance on cryptocurrencies has been mixed and fluid, as demonstrated by how the “CryptoRuble” — the national stablecoin project — has been unfolding. First, the prospect of using a substitute for conventional money was deemed “illegal” by financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev. Then, the Kremlin supposedly decided that a pet stablecoin could “minimize the amount of anonymous transactions,” or even help evade Western sanctions, thereby greenlighting the project. However, the CryptoRuble ended up on the back burner in the end, as the current status of the project is unclear. It was last mentioned in the news in January 2019, when a government official declared that it could go live “in a 2-3 years,” although the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) was acting “very conservatively” about the idea.

Cryptocurrencies at large are in a similar situation. In October 2017, President Vladimir Putin claimed that cryptocurrencies “cause serious risk” and are used for crime, citing the CBR’s decision to block websites selling digital assets. Just a month prior to that, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov argued that the authorities had to accept the idea of the digital currencies market:

“There is no sense in banning them, there is a need to regulate them.”

There have been numerous attempts to define cryptocurrencies legally since then. At different times, Russian lawmakers have been urged to introduce a regulatory framework by President Putin (twice), the local Supreme Arbitration Court and the Financial Action Task Force.

In May 2018, the crypto bill — titled “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFA) — was passed by the Russian parliament but was soon sent back to the first reading stage due to the lack of definitions for key concepts, such as crypto mining, cryptocurrencies and tokens.

Last month, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reportedly said that the popularity of cryptocurrencies “has decreased,” which is why the regulation issue “not that relevant” anymore. Notably, a year ago, he urged the government to legislate at least some basic crypto terms.

The current deadline for the regulatory framework set by Putin expires in July.

Recap of SPIEF, an annual Russian business event for the economic sector

Binance and Huobi reported an influx of traders, Vitalik Buterin talked about Ethereum 2.0

Despite the prime minister’s suggestion that cryptocurrencies have decreased in popularity, they were widely discussed at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), an annual Russian business event for the economic sector, which took place from 6 to 8 June.

The panel dubbed “Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies: Past, Present, Future” saw Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of Ethereum; Chris Lee, a financial director at Huobi; Ted Lin, chief growth officer at Binance; and Kevin Shao, among others, featured in the expert pool.

Lin and Lee reported an influx of traders of a “new generation” on their platforms due to the recent market growth. According to them, the trend will persist for the near future.

Buterin, in turn, talked about Ethereum 2.0, also called Serenity — a major upgrade that is supposed to make Ethereum 1,000 times more scalable in 18 to 24 months.

The Bank of Russia said that cryptocurrencies are not part of traditional financial sector

Sergey Shvetsov, first deputy governor of the CBR, reportedly compared cryptocurrencies to a “game” while peaking at the SPIEF. He is quoted as saying:

“If we’re talking about cryptocurrencies and forex-clubs, it’s not a financial market, it’s just a game. There are people who like to play, they invest in it [cryptocurrency], but the ripples will affect others. Which is why we have quite a strict policy here.”

Hence, the CBR once again stressed its skeptical position toward cryptocurrencies. Last month, Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Bank of Russia, said her agency was against the idea of crypto becoming a substitute for fiat money.

Russian official suggested creating a special economic zone that would cater to cryptocurrencies

Leonid Petukhov, the head of the Far East Investment and Export Agency, suggested creating an offshore destination for cryptocurrencies on the Bolshoi Ussuriysky island, which lies on the border with China. He told TASS, a Russian news media:

“We want to make a large financial center there. Metaphorically speaking, that would involve cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges, timber trading platforms — so like domestic offshore, in a good sense. What we did in Kaliningrad.”

Petukhov was likely referring to Oktyabrsky Island in the Kaliningrad region, which, along with Russky Island in Vladivostok, became offshore economic zones in 2018. Foreign companies registering in those clusters are exempt from certain levies — for instance, they are free from paying taxes on profits received by way of dividends. However, neither of those zones currently involve any cryptocurrency-related benefits.

Head of Russia’s largest bank said that bitcoin is for transactions, not investment — plans to stick with blockchain instead

Herman Gref, CEO of state-owned bank Sberbank, declared that he considers bitcoin a “technical instrument for transactions,” rather than a type of investment. He also referred to his own experience of investments in crypto, revealing that he had bought bitcoin when it was worth about $5 and used it for payment purposes instead of holding the coins.

Further, Gref clarified that his bank will not develop any crypto-related services but will focus on blockchain-enabled tools instead. As the CEO put it, the crypto market’s hype has gone, but “regular work with blockchain tech has remained,” which makes him “happy.”

Nornickel teamed up with IBM to curate blockchain academic programmes

Nornickel, the world's leading producer of nickel and palladium, signed a partnership agreement with IBM and the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) during the forum. The alliance will establish an education center that will offer blockchain-related programs, both for postgraduate and Ph.D. students.

“Students and postgraduates will learn how to apply blockchain technologies, and will gain knowledge about cryptocurrency exchanges, stablecoins, tokenization platforms and similar services,” the parties reportedly declared in a mutual statement.

Moreover, Nornickel’s president, Vladimir Potanin, argued that tokenization has the potential to make trading easier, cheaper and more transparent. Earlier in March, he unveiled his company’s plans to create cryptocurrency tokens backed by palladium. Those tokens will purportedly be used for trading palladium through a Switzerland-based palladium fund, as well as on several other digital platforms.

Private blockchain platform for enterprises and government launched its mainnet

Blockchain-based Vostok platform’s main network was launched at SPIEF. The mainnet will reportedly be used to validate transactions, while Vostok’s clients — represented by large Russian corporations and state agencies — will also have the ability to create their own nodes and use private subnets.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod had begun testing the use of the Vostok-powered application “City N,” which allegedly allows residents to file their taxes and verify their identity, among other things.

Russia’s leading oil company said a Facebook coin could be used to purchase oil in the future

Igor Sechin, head of major Russian oil company Rosneft, reflected on a potential relationship between oil and cryptocurrencies. Specifically, he said that the possibility of paying for oil using digital assets in the future “should not be ruled out.”

According to Sechin, Silicon Valley tech giants like Google, Amazon and Apple are beginning to explore the oil and gas sector, which is why a Facebook stablecoin could one day be used to purchase oil by the barrel.

Further, Sechin warned there are some obstacles that cryptocurrencies need to overcome in order to draw the attention of energy giants. He was quoted as saying:

“Greater flexibility often means greater volatility, and digitalization creates risks for maintaining commercial secrets and leads to the need to create new regulatory mechanisms, additional reservations. Today, technology companies do not have quality answers to these fundamental questions.”

Russian government continues to look into blockchain, but remains cold on digital assets

Meanwhile, the Russian government continues to consider strict regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. Most recently, a representative of Russia’s parliament mentioned that the officials are considering imposing administrative responsibility for the mining of cryptocurrencies.

“We believe that cryptocurrencies created on open blockchains such as bitcoins, ethers, and others are illegitimate tools,” Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, told TASS.

Things are much more bullish on the blockchain front, however. This week, Russian authorities signed an agreement with Danish logistics titan Maersk to launch TradeLens — a blockchain shipping platform — across all of Russia to digitize paper-based transportation operations. Earlier last month, Russian state-owned holding conglomerate Rostec proposed an ambitious roadmap on applying blockchain in all the governmental data systems — all of which seems to suggest that Russia’s intentions toward the technology are getting increasingly serious.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/06/148457-jack-dorsey-twitter-and-square-ceo-talks-up-companys-nascent-crypto-development-team/,"Jack Dorsey, self-taught programmer and co-founder of Twitter and Square gave two interviews this week in which he talked up Square’s recent efforts to coalesce an in-house team of developers that will contribute to coding Bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies.

Square began by providing credit card payment software and hardware solutions to small businesses and has since moved into mobile payments and lending.

The Square cash-app for mobile devices is also bitcoin-trade enabled, and, according to Quartz, Square’s move into payments could not have been better timed as the globe shift into mobile payments.

According to Dorsey, the global financial sector now is under the sway of two big “secular trends.” The first is algorithm-based (automated) decision- making around lending.

Dorsey says algorithms will have to “explain themselves” and the decisions they make regarding loans, but if successful, this type of processing, he believes, “…will increase the velocity and therefore the scale,” of lending.

The second trend is blockchain and cryptocurrency, according to Dorsey.

The Twitter/Square CEO said he favours one currency for the Internet, a digital cash network that will mimic the Internet’s apparent seamlessness:

“…We have all these currencies for every nation state, but if you consider the internet to be the equivalent to a nation state, it will have a currency native to itself, and there is not going to be any one party or institution that makes this happen, and there’s not going to be any one party or institution that can stop it from happening. And having a global currency that is native to the internet will allow companies like ours to move much faster and reach a lot more people.”

As more and more members of humanity convene online, Dorsey thinks it’s useful for them to use one currency:

“As we bring more people online, we can also imagine a trend in parallel where they all have access to the same currency, and there are still conversions to a local currency like the pound, but being able to have one currency really takes away some of the barriers of the past and how we think about global markets.”

When asked about Facebook’s forthcoming digital currency, about which details remain sketchy, Dorsey repeated his call for an autonomous global currency:

“…(W)e need a currency for the internet. And the internet being an entity that isn’t controlled by any company or any one government, that is for the world and for the people of the world… would hope that all private companies can see the value of having a stateless currency that all people can access, and is not bounded or constrained by any one corporate entity.”

While it is unclear thus far if Square’s crypto team will create a “Square crypto,” Dorsey said that, thus far, he thinks Bitcoin is the best contender for becoming the Internet’s native currency:

“I haven’t seen any other currency that would challenge it across the dimensions that I think are really important. First, I think it has an amazing brand. The other thing that I think makes it probably the strongest candidate is that the principles behind it are very pure. The creation of it was very pure, and focused on a public good, rather than any other particular agenda.”

For the record, not every technician considers Bitcoin a “pure” product of a healthy subculture.

Blockchain skeptic, author and Unix system administrator David Gerard, for example, has famously called Bitcoin an “apocalyptic death cult” and “pile of shit.”

Gerard’s blog posts regularly savage the leading edge in crypto and offer a poison-penned antidote to the vigorous market-spiel that otherwise characterizes the coverage in “the space,” as it were.

Anyways, like many Bitcoin enthusiasts, Dorsey cited Bitcoin’s (perceived) deflationary design (limited Bitcoins will be issued but they are highly divisible and appear to have been heavily wash traded), it’s “resilience” (Bitcoin’s massively polluting encryption system makes it hard to attack) and dedicated community of developers as signs it will likely prevail.

In a separate interview at Hard Fork, Dorsey cited regulatory drag as the reason why he supports the notion of an autonomous currency for the Internet:

“Just from a business perspective, we don’t look like an Internet company today. An Internet company can launch something and it’s available around the world. Whereas with payments, you have to go to each market and pay attention to regulators. You need a partnership with a local bank. This is a very slow process in any new market. The Internet having a native currency will enable us to be more like an Internet company.”

Countless crypto-enabled scams don’t torpedo Dorsey’s vision. He called cryptocurrencies’ underlying mathematical protocols “very sound.”

Dorsey announced in March Square’s creation of a developer team to work on Bitcoin/crypto:

#BitcoinTwitter and #CryptoTwitter! Square is hiring 3-4 crypto engineers and 1 designer to work full-time on open source contributions to the bitcoin/crypto ecosystem. Work from anywhere, report directly to me, and we can even pay you in bitcoin! Introducing @SqCrypto. Why? — jack 🌍🌏🌎 (@jack) March 20, 2019

The current team lead, according to a June 12th Tweet from Square, is Steve Lee, “angel investor, startup advisor, and former Director at Google.”

The team is coming together slowly because of many considerations, said Dorsey:

“Bitcoin is interesting because a lot of the innovation isn’t being driven in the US. We wanted to make sure that we had a global mindset. We also had to create a structure.”

Square is reportedly not offering Square stock-options to its crypto- team members (Square stock has gone from $15 IPO price in 2015 to about $72 now).

Instead, it is offering to pay or incentivize the team either (partly) in Bitcoins, “…which would incentivize them to serve the Bitcoin community better,” or in standard currencies.

All told, Square’s crypto team is expected to be comprised of five engineers and one designer.

It will focus on efficiency, security and “non-obvious” problems, Dorsey said.

Dorsey suggested that the team could have a substantial impact if all five engineers just worked on code-reviews of Bitcoin:

“…(J)ust to verify the correctness of code coming in, that would be a huge boost to the community. It would boost the velocity of the development.”

NextWeb characterized Square’s crypto team as “his baby,” something Dorsey seemed to confirm:",2019-06-14

The digital currency industry is fired up about Facebook's cryptocurrency efforts. Bitcoin bulls say the tech giant's stamp of approval would legitimize the space, make it easier to buy other digital assets, and spark major financial institutions to get out of ""wait and see"" mode. ""Facebook's efforts in the space has the potential to be one of, if not the most significant external catalysts for bitcoin and crypto adoption in the technology's history,"" said Spencer Bogart, general partner at San Francisco-based investment firm Blockchain Capital.

Several news outlets including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal have reported that the company has been building its own digital currency for users to trade and spend through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Some reports say Facebook is set to announce its plans this week, helping bitcoin rally above $9,000 to more than a one-year high. Facebook shares also jumped more than 3 percent Monday ahead of the expected announcement. The social network hired former PayPal executive David Marcus to begin exploring opportunities with blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As it approaches a public release, there are now more than 100 people working on the project, according to information on LinkedIn, and Facebook is still expanding the team. The Information reported that Facebook is also planning physical, ATM-like machines where users can buy the currency and that company employees will be able to collect salary in the form of new currency.

Lowering the barrier

One side effect of Facebook's entrance to the market would be an easier entry point for the average person to buy cryptocurrencies. Right now, bitcoin and others can be bought on exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini, or through some consumer finance apps like Square Cash and Robinhood. One of the biggest friction points is transitioning from dollars, or another global currency, to digital assets. But once someone is on-boarded to the world of digital assets, there's comparatively less hassle in moving from one asset like Facebook's, to another, like bitcoin, Blockchain Capital's Spencer Bogart said. ""Given Facebook's distribution, the seriousness of their crypto effort, and the caliber of the partners they're working with, they have a significant chance of onboarding much of the world to digital assets,"" he told CNBC. Barry Silbert, an early bitcoin backer and founder and CEO Digital Currency Group, said the launch of Facebook's cryptocurrency ""will go down in history as THE catalyst that propelled digital assets (including bitcoin) to mass global consumer adoption"" and will be remembered as ""just as important -- and transformative -- as the launch of the Netscape browser.""

Legitimizing crypto

Bitcoin itself was formed as a way to bypass traditional financial rails. It first made international headlines after Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox experienced a series of hacks and was later effectively frozen out of the U.S. banking system for regulatory issues and by 2013 shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection. Dark web marketplace Silk Road used bitcoin to facilitate transactions for guns, drugs and other illicit goods and was shut down in 2015. Bitcoin became known as the currency of choice for criminals, which is still how it's categorized by some who question its use in modern finance. ""Early bitcoin and crypto people are viewed as anarchists — many are anti government anti establishment with anti bank rhetoric — that's why the big financial institutions have been wary of investing and supporting cryptocurrency,"" said Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association. ""When you have a big list of institutional players come in, it does provide more legitimacy to this industry."" The first and most famous digital currency sparked mania among retail investors last year and brought it into mainstream finance. Bitcoin hit a high of nearly $20,000 at the end of 2017. Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, said the concept of cryptocurrency became increasingly normalized as that pool of traders grew. Investors are mostly past that ""mental hurdle"" and see bitcoin as less esoteric and less strange, he said.

""I think Facebook coming out with their own coin would make digital currency more familiar to people,"" Moro told CNBC in a phone interview. Another question for both bitcoin investors and skeptics was its eventual mainstream use case. Bitcoin was founded as a peer-to-peer payment but has largely taken form as a store of value, or ""digital gold"" instead. In that sense, Moro said Facebook's cryptocurrency and bitcoin wouldn't compete, and ""serve two different purposes."" ""People have always questioned how mainstream adoption of something like this might come about. Having the retail base that Facebook has certainly helps that,"" Moro said. ""It's bullish for cashless society in general."" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek research also said the move legitimizes bitcoin. And for every company that's not a part of Facebook's so-called Libra project, ""there are thousands who are not."" ""What technology will they use? Bitcoin is one answer,"" Colas said. ""The fact that Facebook et al even want to build a crypto currency validates the idea of a decentralized currency/payment system.""

Infrastructure

Others see this move as motivation for financial institutions to build the necessary rails to support crypto adoption. Fidelity was one of the early entrants by providing custody and trade execution on multiple exchanges for investors such as hedge funds and family offices with a new company called Fidelity Digital Asset Services. ""With Facebook and its partners making a concerted push into the space, these financial institutions and payments providers can no longer afford to take a wait-and-see approach, they need to prioritize the buildout of supporting infrastructure now,"" Blockchain Capital's Bogart said. Part of the risk in cryptocurrency investing is how to prevent them from being hacked. Experts say that has largely barred institutions from embracing these digital assets. Facebook's crypto effort may end up ""catalyzing"" the build-out of infrastructure like wallets, custody and compliance among large financial institutions and payments providers, Bogart said.

Regulatory hurdles",2019-06-17,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/06/17/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-white-paper/,"Tomorrow, Facebook is expected to release full details of its new “cryptocurrency” project Libra — as always, Twitter has lots to say.

Few concrete facts about Facebook‘s Libra (formally known as GlobalCoin) have been made public so far. Reports indicate the likes of Mastercard, Visa, Stripe, and PayPal have already paid a $10 million fee to become validators on the network, which allows untapped access to related data.

Facebook‘s rumored goal is to attract 100 companies to join the Libra Association, which would see Zuckerberg and co. net a cool $1 billion right off the bat.

I made a bet with Facebook executives 3 years ago that they are going to launch a coin, they were laughing back then… $FB coin is going to make #Crypto mass market — Yoni Assia (@yoniassia) June 14, 2019

Key distinction: Facebook’s Libra is an incremental *evolutionary* build on the current payments system, one step further on the way to endgame WeChat financial surveillance. Bitcoin is *revolutionary* — a completely new technological path that could preserve financial privacy. https://t.co/hVvn7GkWqQ — Alex Gladstein (@gladstein) June 15, 2019

Unlike Libra, Bitcoin is a permissionless system, in which anyone with access to the computational resources required to run a full node (or a mining rig) can join. These are available for purchase for significantly less than $10 million.

We do know Libra will be a “stablecoin” pegged to a raft of international fiat currencies to reduce volatility, but the social media giant is yet to formally disclose exactly which ones (or even precisely how its value will be calculated and backed).

It's an odd feeling rewatching the Social Network and rooting for @tylerwinklevoss twins this time. #Libracoin — Yaz Khoury (@Yazanator) June 16, 2019

I cant believe there are people advocating Libracoin. These companies controll all of your data and now they will control your money too. It's the beginning of the social credit era in the west. — Beastlorion (@Beastlyorion) June 15, 2019

Facebook reportedly seeks to make Libra accessible to everyone, and will pitch it as a method of providing the 1.7 billion “unbanked” adults around the world with financial services (a number apparently sourced from a 2017 report published by the Global Findex Database).

The advent of Libra will place the social media giant within the realm of fintech. Despite it being a stablecoin, some pundits say Facebook’s sheer reach could see it have a negative impact on Bitcoin.

Other Twitter commentators hilariously believe this is all a conspiracy, and it’s really Ripple (XRP) that will power Libra, which seems an impressive exercise in optimism.

Facebook's new crypto currency ""Libra"" is bad news for Bitcoin. Facebook will target the very market Bitcoin is counting on for growth, the unbanked in nations with high inflation. Libra will be stable, and much easier and cheaper to use as a medium of exchange than Bitcoin. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) June 14, 2019

The leading cryptocurrency by market value clocked a 13-month high of $9,391 on Bitstamp on Sunday and was last seen trading at $9,200, representing 22 percent gains on last Monday’s low of $7,524.

Cryptocurrency market experts and investors are associating the sharp price gains seen over the last six days with a number of factors, the most prominent being Facebook’s coming foray into cryptocurrencies.

Facebook to launch ‘GlobalCoin’

The social media giant is set to unveil its very own stablecoin, reportedly called GlobalCoin on Tuesday, June 17, with a launch to follow in 2020.

The project has reportedly already secured the backing of over a dozen companies and is seen boosting the pace of widespread cryptocurrency adoption by many including Barry Silbert, the founder and chief executive of Digital Currency Group.

Meanwhile, Spencer Bogart, General Partner at Blockchain Capital, believes Facebook’s crypto effort is among the most bullish external tailwinds for bitcoin in 2019/2020, as it will ease the friction in acquiring digital assets by creating a circular economy.

Further, there is a consensus in the investor community that Facebook’s crypto will create awareness that a private, non-central bank issued currency can exist, leading to increased adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The hype garnered by GlobalCoin likely put a bid under the cryptocurrency over the weekend. That, however, makes BTC vulnerable to “sell the fact” trading following the expected white paper launch on Tuesday.

Binance.com bars US customers

Binance.com, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by trading volume, updated its terms of use on June 14 to exclude all users in the U.S.

The announcement led to a sharp sell-off in Binance’s very own native asset, Binance Coin (BNB). The price of BNB fell 12.8 percent to 25,209 satoshis (a satoshi being 0.00000001 of a BTC) on Friday, and hit a one-month low of 34,906 satoshis on Sunday.

The slide indicates that investors have rotated money out of BNB and possibly into bitcoin, pushing the top cryptocurrency higher, as discussed by Alex Kruger – a prominent Fundamental & Technical Analyst.

Litecoin approaches ‘halving’ event

The upcoming litecoin (LTC) halving, set to trigger on August 5, 2019, will cut the reward gained from mining the cryptocurrency by half, meaning LTC will become a more scarce asset overall.

”Halvings’ as they are known, typically result in an overall boost in value for the crypto markets, as the assets themselves become harder to obtain and therefore increase in value.

Litecoin has already rallied 353 percent this year and may have added fuel to the ongoing bitcoin’s price rally. It is worth noting that litecoin led the broader markets higher in the first quarter, with 100 percent gains over the period.

What next?

As noted earlier, bitcoin may see a pullback following Facebook’s announcement on Tuesday. The long duration charts, however, indicate that corrections, if any, could be short-lived.

Weekly and monthly charts

Bitcoin jumped 17.57 percent last week (above left), invalidating the bearish view put forward by the previous week’s close below $8,000.

Further, the 5- and 10-week moving averages are trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while Chaikin money flow is reporting the strongest buying pressure since December with an above-0.32 reading.

The bullish case looks stronger if we take into account the falling channel breakout on the monthly chart (above right).

As a result, BTC could rise to $10,000 over the next few weeks. In the short-term, a price pullback cannot be ruled out.

Daily chart

BTC printed 13-month highs above $9,300 on Sunday but failed to close above $9,097 – the high of the bearish outside reversal candle created on May 30.

Another failure to secure a UTC close above $9,097 may trigger profit taking on long positions, leading to a price pullback to the 200-hour moving average (MA), currently at $8,300.

Per the announcement, the newly-released BEP2 token will be traded on Binance and will also be available on its decentralized counterpart Binance DEX. Furthermore, this asset is one of a series of cryptocurrency-pegged tokens which the company intends to launch on Binance Chain.

The post states that BTCB are 100% backed by bitcoin, with the reserves easily visible as they are recorded on the public blockchain. Binance noted that using bitcoin as a backing asset for the new token allows for more convenient audits, as the wallets are available to anyone through the public blockchain explorer:

“The blockchain offers a much easier way to audit a crypto reserve than a traditional bank balance tether.”

On Binance, the token will be traded against BTC, allowing users to exchange BTCB for the native asset to which it is pegged.

The post explains that creating cryptocurrency-pegged tokens on the Binance Chain will give users of the Binance DEX access to tokens that have their own blockchains and are not on the Binance Chain.

Furthermore, Binance says that an increased selection of tokens on the decentralized exchange will result in increased volume and liquidity. Still, the company admits that such an approach compromises decentralization:

“While this approach is more centralized than atomic swaps, we believe it provides a higher degree of ease-of-use to most traders. And most traders are already trusting Binance.com to hold their funds anyway.”

In an apparently related tweet earlier today, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao announced that the exchange was about to move 9,001 BTC. In another tweet he posted hours later, Zhao seemingly confirmed that the transferred funds are meant to back its bitcoin-backed token:

As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of June, Binance DEX will block website access to users based in 29 countries, including the United States.

In a conversation with CoinDesk, Roubini – also nicknamed “Dr. Doom” for his prediction of the financial crash in 2007 and 2008 – said:

“It has nothing to do with blockchain. Fully private, controlled, centralized, verified and authorized by a small number of permissioned nodes. So what is crypto or blockchain about it? None.”

Indeed, according to recent reports, the social media giant has signed up more than a dozen backers for its GlobalCoin cryptocurrency, a stablecoin apparently to be backed by a basket of fiat currencies. Each of the new backers – which reportedly include Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber – will invest roughly $10 million in the project as part of a governing consortium for the cryptocurrency.

While he acknowledged that specifics of the project are not yet known (but are expected to be revealed in a white paper Tuesday), Roubini suggested that it is unlikely that GlobalCoin would use common blockchain technologies such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake. “Why would they?” he said.

And while many in the crypto community have also criticized those calling Facebook’s token a cryptocurrency, the economist denied that he shared any common ground with the “crypto faithful.”

He told CoinDesk that he has gone on record as saying that “enterprise DLT [distributed ledger technology] is blockchain in name only … so some crypto faithful may agree on that.”

Roubini concluded by saying:

“But in my opinion, public decentralized trustless blockchain is a pipe dream … so we disagree on 99% of [the] substance.”

Writing on the website, the director and founder of CCN Markets and Hawkfish AS, Jonas Borchgrevink, blamed the update for an overnight fall of 71% of the site’s mobile traffic. While Borchgrevink noted that ups and downs are part of the business, such a vertiginous fall is unprecedented in its history. At the time of the post, the founder said that it could not support new additions to its team or its current operations from advertiser revenue in the given climate.

Within the online crypto media sphere, CCN was not alone in taking a beating. According to data from Sistrix.com, CoinDesk also experienced a drop in traffic. Crypto news took what some are alleging to be a targeted hammering, even though United Kingdom-based online media juggernaut Daily Mail also reportedly lost half of its organic website traffic.

Related to this: The Strange Case of CCN and the Google June 2019 Core Update

At the time of this post on June 10, Borchgrevink and the CCN team were at a loss as to what could have merited such a steep drop off in visibility:

“If Google thinks that CCN, all of a sudden – remember, literally overnight -, is bad, then why not give us the chance to understand the why and give us a way to change before any major update. Instead, we are kicked in the teeth overnight with zero knowledge of what we have done wrong, impacting a team of 60+ people. 6 years of work is evaporated.”

However, only two days later, on June 12, CCN reported that it had clawed its way back into existence after an intensive period of consulting with SEO gurus and experts in the Google Webmasters forum. In the post, also authored by Borchgrevink, it is clear that the team is still not entirely sure what caused the drop, but continue to reference the June 3 update:

“Whether or not the Google June 2019 Core Update is to blame, we are fixing it. We’re receiving help from multiple SEO teams to understand what has transpired.”

Expert reaction to CCN’s self-proclaimed struggles

Several members of the crypto community spoke to Cointelegraph, stating that the update serves as a prominent example of how powerful, centralized corporations can currently smother crypto initiatives. Richard Red, research lead at Decred, a community-directed digital currency, said the update presents an issue for both freedom of the press and of information:

“Regardless of how people feel about CCN, the fact that changes to Google's search algorithm can make or break media producers is one of many illustrations of the power wielded by large tech companies running centralized services. A centralized authority that can selectively ‘hide’ content signals a broader problem with freedom of the press and the public’s ability to find information.”

Roneil Rumberg, CEO and co-founder of the decentralized music streaming platform Audius, also said this is typical of the dangers of centralized power and called for a more transparent approach to online media:

“The unfortunate situation faced by CCN is inevitable when centralized aggregators like Google control content discovery. Those whose livelihood depends on aggregators have little insight into how these services work, let alone any say in how they are changed over time. They are subject to the whims of Google, YouTube, SoundCloud, or whoever else they are contributing to, and risk being deplatformed, demonetized, or otherwise taken for granted.”

Tak Kol, co-founder of the Orbs public blockchain, also commented on Google’s power to shape opinions and called for change that allows people to protect themselves from what he sees as abuses of such power:

“The situation with CCN and publications like it shows how much power Google has in dictating which news channels can flourish and which should disappear with a behind-the-scenes change in its algorithm. There is a solution to protect ourselves against potential abuse — and this is transparency, through blockchain technology. We should demand filters like Google to be explicit regarding the criteria of what's deemed important, and we should demand to audit that this criteria is indeed what's executed under the hood.”

Ad nauseam: Google’s chequered past with crypto

This is not the first time that Google appears to have taken a hard line on decentralization and crypto in general. The most prominent example of hostility from Google occured in June 2018, when the company announced that it would ban all crypto-related advertising in accordance with an update to its Financial Services policy.

The official announcement came days after crypto advertisers had noticed a sharp drop in views for its advertisements. At the time, Google AdWords denied that any change in its regulations would block crypto or initial coin offering (ICO) ads. However, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, Google’s updated financial products policy clearly stated that an advertisement ban will be imposed on “cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice).”

The move, however, was not necessarily out of character for Google, with Google’s director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, demonstrating a hesitant approach to all cryptocurrencies in a March 14 interview with CNBC:

""We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.”

In September, the company announced that it would revise its advertising policy in October in order to allow some crypto businesses targeting the United States and Japan.

Fast-forward to January 2019 and Google’s advertising policy on cryptocurrencies remains relatively unchanged, with smart contract auditing startup Decenter tweeting that the company has blacklisted keywords mentioning Ethereum on Google Ads.

In response, the official Google Ads account replied to the tweet, stating that exchanges are permitted to target the United States and Japan and that ads targeting other countries could be liable for rejection.

Decenter further explained that, when trying to use “ethereum development services” and “ethereum security audits” as keywords, an error message would pop up. Google Ads replied to this in a tweet:

Hi there, thanks for your response. Although we wouldn't be able to preemptively confirm if your keyword is eligible to trigger ads, we'd recommend that you refer to the 'Cryptocurrencies' section of our policy on Financial products and services: https://t.co/BpvQoukwY3. -Chetan — Google Ads (@GoogleAds) January 10, 2019

Decenter consequently turned to the Ethereum community on Reddit, where the team stated:

“Any of the keywords that contain ‘ethereum’ in our campaigns are no longer showing ads as of January 9th and are now reporting the following error:”

At the time, the Reddit post’s top comment accused Google of a lack of neutrality:

“Google has various political and economic agendas, and they are quite willing to use their various services to promote their preferences. AdSense and Youtube are notorious for this, but there have been some incidents regarding the play store as well.”

Google is not the only centralized tech giant to have a troubled relationship with both crypto and crypto advertising. Prior to lifting the requirements on May 8 for crypto and blockchain promoters to get consent for running advertisements, Facebook had adopted various degrees of censorship.

In January 2018, Facebook decided to ban all cryptocurrency and ICO advertisements — a move that was widely criticized by the crypto community as unnecessary. Dejun Qian, the founder of Fusion, which provides a financial transaction ecosystem, said:

“This policy will definitely protect people from the scams of predatory projects. However announcing an ‘intentionally broad’ policy is always the easiest way and not necessarily the best route for technology development.”

Since then, Facebook has come to relax its approach to advertising as long as advertisements are not seen to be promoting one currency in particular or initial coin offerings. And Facebook has since announced that it will launch its own stablecoin.

E-commerce giants show uniform approach to crypto

It is not only big tech that’s showing resistance to cryptocurrencies. In 2019, two of the world’s foremost e-commerce giants demonstrated varying degrees of hostility to cryptocurrencies and associated cryptocurrency advertising.

On March 18, South America’s largest e-commerce company, Mercado Livre, banned cryptocurrency advertising on its website, according to reporting from Cointelegraph em Portugues. Mercado Livre, which recently overtook Amazon as the top e-commerce marketplace in Latin America, sent out emails to users that laid out the change in company policy. According to an email shared with Cointelegraph, all listings related to digital currency would automatically be removed from the platform as of March 19:

""We would like to inform you that as of March 19, you will no longer be able to advertise used products in the following categories: - Cryptocurrencies - Prepaid cards for games

“Because you have ads for used products that will soon be banned, we recommend that you end them. Otherwise, they will be finalized on the date mentioned above.""

Mercado Livre’s biggest rival, Amazon, also demonstrated its less-than-enthusiastic approach to cryptocurrencies in 2019. Twitch, a streaming company owned by the U.S. e-commerce behemoth, removed bitcoin (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) as payment options for subscriptions, according to a Reddit user on March 23.

Payday blues: Payment providers close the door on crypto

Although the initial benefits of cryptocurrency for payment providers are numerous, a number of high-profile companies have either removed payment options or outright banned crypto payments.

On May 7, Dovey Wan, a founding partner of Primitive Ventures and a prominent figure in China-related crypto affairs, tweeted that the Chinese social media titan and payment service provider WeChat will ban merchants from making cryptocurrency payments.

A translation of the Payment Service Protocol, posted on weixin.qq.com, revealed that the ban is due to changes in payment regulation and efforts to ensure “the prevention of illegal telecommunications networks and criminal matters” brought about by the People’s Bank of China.

As per the screenshot posted by Wan, users who carry out crypto trades are liable to have their accounts terminated. The screenshot also shows that “merchants may not engage in illegal transactions such as virtual currency.”

Unsurprisingly, given the chilly atmosphere for cryptocurrencies in China, WeChat is far from alone in its approach. In August 2018, the mobile payment app Alipay clamped down on users who were using their accounts for over-the-counter (OTC) bitcoin trading, according to Beijing News.

As per the state-affiliated Chinese newspaper, Alipay tightened restrictions on and permanently blocked accounts carrying out bitcoin OTC trades. The article also stated that a system had been created to monitor key websites and accounts for this purpose.

Misfortune for crypto payments in China continued into 2019, when Alipay and WeChat both requested that crypto exchange Huobi remove their payment services from its OTC trading desk, according to a report by local media agency Sina published on Jan. 25.

Outside of China, the chief financial officer of PayPal said that the company is reluctant to get involved with cryptocurrencies, according to an interview with Yahoo Finance on May 7.

CFO John Rainey said that, although the company had previously allowed payments in bitcoin, the volatility of the currency meant that merchants would just convert bitcoin to a more stable currency, such as the euro or dollar. Rainey commented that, although the company is not currently interested in cryptocurrencies, he did not rule out involvement in the future:

“We have teams clearly working on blockchain and cryptocurrency as well, and we want to participate in that in whatever form it takes in the future. I just think it’s a little early on right now.”

BTC cards suffer setback, Visa and Mastercard categorize crypto as high-risk

In January, Visa ended its working relationship with debit card provider WaveCrest, affecting crypto card products provided by CryptoPay, Bitwala, Wirex and others. The move was initially believed to be a company crackdown on cryptocurrency services, but was later revealed to be due to WaveCrest violating Visa’s policies.

A Visa spokesperson commented that the issue came down to noncompliance on WaveCrest’s behalf and that it had not adopted a blanket ban on such products:

""We can confirm that WaveCrest’s Visa membership is being terminated due to continued non-compliance with our operating rules. All of WaveCrest’s Visa card programmes will be closed as a result. Visa has other approved card programmes that use fiat funds converted from cryptocurrency in a number of jurisdictions. The termination of WaveCrest’s Visa membership does not affect these other products.”

In October, Finance Magnates reported on the news that payment titans Mastercard and Visa would classify cryptocurrency and ICOs as “high risk.” The publication, which did not disclose its sources, reported that a ban will be applied to brokers operating from “unregulated or loosely regulated environments,” a sweeping description that proved damning for the wave of crypto debit cards. As no universal policy exists for regulating cryptocurrency payments, many companies offering crypto debit card services could, as a consequence, be seen as not having applied proper due diligence to their business.

The publication also referred to regulations brought in by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in June, establishing leverage limits for local retailers in the European Union. Steve Maijoor, the ESMA chairman, said that the regulation would seek to protect investors:

“The new measures on CFDs will, for the first time, ensure that investors cannot lose more money than they put in, restrict the use of leverage and incentives, and provide understandable risk warnings for investors.”

Unregulated brokers are reportedly classified as “high-risk securities merchants” by the two biggest debit/credit card issuers. Mastercard acted on Oct. 12, 2018, and the subsequent changes would affect “all transaction globally via Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, and Maestro.”

The move to target crypto debit cards is not that surprising, given the views of management at the two payment giants. Mastercard CEO Ajaypal Banga voiced his criticism of cryptocurrencies, stating that nonstate-issued coins are junk, due to their high volatility and the as-of-yet unrealized goal of operating as a real alternative to fiat currency.

To strengthen the narrative, Mastercard released a series of anti-bitcoin videos, narrated by the president of Mastercard Southeast Asia, Matthew Driver, in which he questioned the anonymous nature of crypto transactions:",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/santander-loses-appeal-against-brazilian-crypto-exchange-fine-upheld,"Major Spanish bank Santander has been denied an appeal regarding a decision by the Court of Justice of the State of São Paulo in a case against crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin, Cointelegraph Brazil reports on June 17.

Santander was sued by the Brazilian exchange Mercado Bitcoin in 2018, after the bank purportedly closed the exchange’s account at its sole discretion. The bank, which has branches in Latin America, cited concerns over the origin of the account’s fund due to the nature of the crypto exchange’s activities.

Over 1 million reals (around $350,000) were locked, but the court subsequently ordered Santander to free the funds. Additionally, the bank must pay a monthly fine equal to 1% interest for the funds that were locked; this reportedly comes out to over 200,000 reals ($51,000).

Today’s decision rejected an additional appeal, and reconfirmed the previous ruling that compels Santander to return the funds and pay the fine.

Cryptocurrency exchanges have previously run into problems with banks closing their accounts, as some financial institutions find the cryptocurrency industry to be too unregulated and/or volatile to conduct business with firms in the space.

Last May, Finnish cryptocurrency wallet service Prasos Oy said that it was one step from being shut down, as most Finnish banks would no longer do business with them. Banks were reportedly concerned that doing business with Prasos Oy would run afoul of current Finnish anti-money laundering laws.

Last April, three Chilean crypto exchanges filed complaints with an appeals court over their accounts being frozen by banks in March. The banks Itau Corpbanca and Scotiabank had locked the accounts for the exchanges BUDA and CryptoMKT, and the public bank Banco del Estado de Chile had frozen Orionx’s account as well as BUDA’s and CryptoMKT’s.",,https://www.coindesk.com/korean-crypto-exchanges-update-tcs-to-accept-liability-for-hacks,"A number of South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges have been forced to update their terms and conditions to accept liability for potential hacks and service issues.

According to a report by the Yonhap News Agency, South Korea’s antitrust watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission, said Monday that five exchanges in total had made the change after it issued a corrective recommendation.

Bithumb, an exchange that has been hacked twice in a year, is included in the five exchanges, the report says. Last June, the platform lost roughly $31 million in cryptocurrencies, and, in May 2019, a possible insider job saw around $20 million in the company’s holdings of XRP and EOS disappear.

Previously the exchanges’ T&Cs had stated that they would not compensate users if not found to be willfully or grossly negligent.

After it’s 2018 hack, Bithumb pledged to refund users that lost cryptos, despite its T&Cs.

In January, only a third of inspected cryptocurrency exchanges got a full pass in a government security audit.

At the time, several government agencies inspected a total of 21 crypto exchanges from September to December 2018, examining 85 different security aspects. However, only 7 – Upbit, Bithumb, Gopax, Korbit, Coinone, Hanbitco, and Huobi Korea – cleared all the tests..

The views expressed here are his own.

With the announcement of Libra, cryptocurrency has entered the big leagues.

Facebook’s entry into this market means every single company now has to take cryptocurrency seriously. Companies around the world are now considering their cryptocurrency strategy.

This is not a repeat of the corporate circle-jerks of 2015 and 2017. Then, companies played with the idea of having a “blockchain” strategy. Blockchain was a buzzword and companies indulged their innovation departments in building toys that never saw the light of day as actual products. This time could not be more different. Facebook has hammered the final nail in the coffin of “blockchain not bitcoin.”

Facebook has taken blockchain seriously. They understand that “the technology” isn’t cool. What’s cool are the unprecedented products that technology can be used to create: digital cash, new currencies and programmatic money. Every business ever has sought to make money.

Now, one of the biggest businesses in the world, has decided to dispense with the middle steps and go straight to the making money part.

“Why, the crypto pundits have been asking, ‘Do they need a blockchain for this?’” Libra, after all, will be permissioned. They could have “just used a database.”

The answer is simple. Even Facebook could not create this product without the (albeit limited) decentralization that blockchain affords. Facebook needs blockchain for this for the same reason any cryptocurrency needs blockchain. The only central actors that are allowed to issue money are regulated financial institutions. They need to be regulated anywhere that money is issued and used. That is hundreds of different jurisdictions with thousands of different regulations.

Blockchains are protocols that create money and transact money in the form of cryptographic proofs. They are unregulated for the same reason peer-to-peer encryption is unregulated: They are too abstract. The combination of decentralized governance and value that results from solving mathematical problems means that regulators even define laws that would be limited enough in scope to make sense and broad enough to be effective.

They have tried to regulate cryptography and encryption many times and always failed.

Up until now that was a curious fact that polite society had agreed to mostly ignore, sometimes with a derisive chuckle. From now on, it is a fact of business that serious-minded executives need to master.

Master it they will, and Facebook has laid out the playbook:

Decentralize as much as is necessary, but no more Provide a token of stable value so that it can be used reliably in commerce Leverage your existing ecosystem to gain users.

Do these things and you a whole world of profiting from seigniorage opens before you. Build loyalty that goes beyond just brand and product to the very means of paying for those products. Collect data previously unheard of, and attribute purchasing behavior to marketing in ways never before possible. Tax every transaction or the interest earned on funds held as reserves. And if you play your cards right, maybe even create money out of thin air.

The big leagues attract the big players. Banks, technology companies, giant retailers, telcos, now have no choice but to enter this game.

The world will not sit idly by and let Facebook own this new, phenomenal market opportunity. A thousand stablecoins are coming. Starbucks will let you buy your venti with “Starbucks.” Verizon and AT&T will issue money as mobile and smart as the device already in your pocket.

Juul will give you discounts if you pay in Jems. The city of Venice will make tourists pay for the burden they have become in, what else, Ducats.

Sure, many of these products will have the same fate as Pets.com. Most products fail. So what? Money is a product now, and if there is one thing every business wants to do, it’s make money.

Bell via Shutterstock",2019-06-18 20:40:09+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/,"Facebook has finally revealed the details of its cryptocurrency, Libra, which will let you buy things or send money to people with nearly zero fees. You’ll pseudonymously buy or cash out your Libra online or at local exchange points like grocery stores, and spend it using interoperable third-party wallet apps or Facebook’s own Calibra wallet that will be built into WhatsApp, Messenger and its own app. Today Facebook released its white paper explaining Libra and its testnet for working out the kinks of its blockchain system before a public launch in the first half of 2020.

Facebook won’t fully control Libra, but instead get just a single vote in its governance like other founding members of the Libra Association, including Visa, Uber and Andreessen Horowitz, which have invested at least $10 million each into the project’s operations. The association will promote the open-sourced Libra Blockchain and developer platform with its own Move programming language, plus sign up businesses to accept Libra for payment and even give customers discounts or rewards.

Facebook is launching a subsidiary company also called Calibra that handles its crypto dealings and protects users’ privacy by never mingling your Libra payments with your Facebook data so it can’t be used for ad targeting. Your real identity won’t be tied to your publicly visible transactions. But Facebook/Calibra and other founding members of the Libra Association will earn interest on the money users cash in that is held in reserve to keep the value of Libra stable.

Facebook’s audacious bid to create a global digital currency that promotes financial inclusion for the unbanked actually has more privacy and decentralization built in than many expected. Instead of trying to dominate Libra’s future or squeeze tons of cash out of it immediately, Facebook is instead playing the long-game by pulling payments into its online domain. Facebook’s VP of blockchain, David Marcus, explained the company’s motive and the tie-in with its core revenue source during a briefing at San Francisco’s historic Mint building. “If more commerce happens, then more small businesses will sell more on and off platform, and they’ll want to buy more ads on the platform so it will be good for our ads business.”

The risk and reward of building the new PayPal

In cryptocurrencies, Facebook saw both a threat and an opportunity. They held the promise of disrupting how things are bought and sold by eliminating transaction fees common with credit cards. That comes dangerously close to Facebook’s ad business that influences what is bought and sold. If a competitor like Google or an upstart built a popular coin and could monitor the transactions, they’d learn what people buy and could muscle in on the billions spent on Facebook marketing. Meanwhile, the 1.7 billion people who lack a bank account might choose whoever offers them a financial services alternative as their online identity provider too. That’s another thing Facebook wants to be.

Yet existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum weren’t properly engineered to scale to be a medium of exchange. Their unanchored price was susceptible to huge and unpredictable swings, making it tough for merchants to accept as payment. And cryptocurrencies miss out on much of their potential beyond speculation unless there are enough places that will take them instead of dollars, and the experience of buying and spending them is easy enough for a mainstream audience. But with Facebook’s relationship with 7 million advertisers and 90 million small businesses plus its user experience prowess, it was well-poised to tackle this juggernaut of a problem.

Now Facebook wants to make Libra the evolution of PayPal . It’s hoping Libra will become simpler to set up, more ubiquitous as a payment method, more efficient with fewer fees, more accessible to the unbanked, more flexible thanks to developers and more long-lasting through decentralization.

“Success will mean that a person working abroad has a fast and simple way to send money to family back home, and a college student can pay their rent as easily as they can buy a coffee,” Facebook writes in its Libra documentation. That would be a big improvement on today, when you’re stuck paying rent in insecure checks while exploitative remittance services charge an average of 7% to send money abroad, taking $50 billion from users annually. Libra could also power tiny microtransactions worth just a few cents that are infeasible with credit card fees attached, or replace your pre-paid transit pass.

…Or it could be globally ignored by consumers who see it as too much hassle for too little reward, or too unfamiliar and limited in use to pull them into the modern financial landscape. Facebook has built a reputation for over-engineered, underused products. It will need all the help it can get if wants to replace what’s already in our pockets.

Here’s our zero-buzzword breakdown of Libra:

How does Libra work?

By now you know the basics of Libra. Cash in a local currency, get Libra, spend them like dollars without big transaction fees or your real name attached, cash them out whenever you want. Feel free to stop reading and share this article if that’s all you care about. But the underlying technology, the association that governs it, the wallets you’ll use and the way payments work all have a huge amount of fascinating detail to them. Facebook has released more than 100 pages of documentation on Libra and Calibra, and we’ve pulled out the most important facts. Let’s dive in.

The Libra Association — crypto’s new oligarchy

Facebook knew people wouldn’t trust it to wholly steer the cryptocurrency they use, and it also wanted help to spur adoption. So the social network recruited the founding members of the Libra Association, a not-for-profit which oversees the development of the token, the reserve of real-world assets that gives it value and the governance rules of the blockchain. “If we were controlling it, very few people would want to jump on and make it theirs,” says Marcus.

Each founding member paid a minimum of $10 million to join and optionally become a validator node operator (more on that later), gain one vote in the Libra Association council and be entitled to a share (proportionate to their investment) of the dividends from interest earned on the Libra reserve into which users pay fiat currency to receive Libra.

The 28 soon-to-be founding members of the association and their industries, previously reported by The Block’s Frank Chaparro, include:

Payments: Mastercard, PayPal, PayU (Naspers’ fintech arm), Stripe, Visa

Technology and marketplaces: Booking Holdings, eBay, Facebook/Calibra, Farfetch, Lyft, Mercado Pago, Spotify AB, Uber Technologies, Inc.

Telecommunications: Iliad, Vodafone Group

Blockchain: Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Inc., Xapo Holdings Limited

Venture Capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square Ventures

Nonprofit and multilateral organizations, and academic institutions: Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking

Facebook says it hopes to reach 100 founding members before the official Libra launch and it’s open to anyone that meets the requirements, including direct competitors like Google or Twitter. The Libra Association is based in Geneva, Switzerland and will meet biannually. The country was chosen for its neutral status and strong support for financial innovation including blockchain technology.

Libra governance — who gets a vote

To join the association, members must have a half rack of server space, a 100Mbps or above dedicated internet connection, a full-time site reliability engineer and enterprise-grade security. Businesses must hit two of three thresholds of a $1 billion USD market value or $500 million in customer balances, reach 20 million people a year and/or be recognized as a top 100 industry leader by a group like Interbrand Global or the S&P.

Crypto-focused investors must have more than $1 billion in assets under management, while Blockchain businesses must have been in business for a year, have enterprise-grade security and privacy and custody or staking greater than $100 million in assets. And only up to one-third of founding members can by crypto-related businesses or individually invited exceptions. Facebook also accepts research organizations like universities, and nonprofits fulfilling three of four qualities, including working on financial inclusion for more than five years, multi-national reach to lots of users, a top 100 designation by Charity Navigator or something like it and/or $50 million in budget.

The Libra Association will be responsible for recruiting more founding members to act as validator nodes for the blockchain, fundraising to jump-start the ecosystem, designing incentive programs to reward early adopters and doling out social impact grants. A council with a representative from each member will help choose the association’s managing director, who will appoint an executive team and elect a board of five to 19 top representatives.

Each member, including Facebook/Calibra, will only get up to one vote or 1% of the total vote (whichever is larger) in the Libra Association council. This provides a level of decentralization that protects against Facebook or any other player hijacking Libra for its own gain. By avoiding sole ownership and dominion over Libra, Facebook could avoid extra scrutiny from regulators who are already investigating it for a sea of privacy abuses as well as potentially anti-competitive behavior. In an attempt to preempt criticism from lawmakers, the Libra Association writes, “We welcome public inquiry and accountability. We are committed to a dialogue with regulators and policymakers. We share policymakers’ interest in the ongoing stability of national currencies.”

The Libra currency — a stablecoin

A Libra is a unit of the Libra cryptocurrency that’s represented by a three wavy horizontal line unicode character ≋ like the dollar is represented by $. The value of a Libra is meant to stay largely stable, so it’s a good medium of exchange, as merchants can be confident they won’t be paid a Libra today that’s then worth less tomorrow. The Libra’s value is tied to a basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities for a slew of historically stable international currencies, including the dollar, pound, euro, Swiss franc and yen. The Libra Association maintains this basket of assets and can change the balance of its composition if necessary to offset major price fluctuations in any one foreign currency so that the value of a Libra stays consistent.

The name Libra comes from the word for a Roman unit of weight measure. It’s trying to invoke a sense of financial freedom by playing on the French stem “Lib,” meaning free.

The Libra Association is still hammering out the exact start value for the Libra, but it’s meant to be somewhere close to the value of a dollar, euro or pound so it’s easy to conceptualize. That way, a gallon of milk in the U.S. might cost 3 to 4 Libra, similar but not exactly the same as with dollars.

The idea is that you’ll cash in some money and keep a balance of Libra that you can spend at accepting merchants and online services. You’ll be able to trade in your local currency for Libra and vice versa through certain wallet apps, including Facebook’s Calibra, third-party wallet apps and local resellers like convenience or grocery stores where people already go to top-up their mobile data plan.

The Libra Reserve — one for one

Each time someone cashes in a dollar or their respective local currency, that money goes into the Libra Reserve and an equivalent value of Libra is minted and doled out to that person. If someone cashes out from the Libra Association, the Libra they give back are destroyed/burned and they receive the equivalent value in their local currency back. That means there’s always 100% of the value of the Libra in circulation, collateralized with real-world assets in the Libra Reserve. It never runs fractional. And unliked “pegged” stable coins that are tied to a single currency like the USD, Libra maintains its own value — though that should cash out to roughly the same amount of a given currency over time.

When Libra Association members join and pay their $10 million minimum, they receive Libra Investment Tokens. Their share of the total tokens translates into the proportion of the dividend they earn off of interest on assets in the reserve. Those dividends are only paid out after Libra Association uses interest to pay for operating expenses, investments in the ecosystem, engineering research and grants to nonprofits and other organizations. This interest is part of what attracted the Libra Association’s members. If Libra becomes popular and many people carry a large balance of the currency, the reserve will grow huge and earn significant interest.

The Libra Blockchain — built for speed

Every Libra payment is permanently written into the Libra Blockchain — a cryptographically authenticated database that acts as a public online ledger designed to handle 1,000 transactions per second. That would be much faster than Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second or Ethereum’s 15. The blockchain is operated and constantly verified by founding members of the Libra Association, which each invested $10 million or more for a say in the cryptocurrency’s governance and the ability to operate a validator node.

When a transaction is submitted, each of the nodes runs a calculation based on the existing ledger of all transactions. Thanks to a Byzantine Fault Tolerance system, just two-thirds of the nodes must come to consensus that the transaction is legitimate for it to be executed and written to the blockchain. A structure of Merkle Trees in the code makes it simple to recognize changes made to the Libra Blockchain. With 5KB transactions, 1,000 verifications per second on commodity CPUs and up to 4 billion accounts, the Libra Blockchain should be able to operate at 1,000 transactions per second if nodes use at least 40Mbps connections and 16TB SSD hard drives.

Transactions on Libra cannot be reversed. If an attack compromises over one-third of the validator nodes causing a fork in the blockchain, the Libra Association says it will temporarily halt transactions, figure out the extent of the damage and recommend software updates to resolve the fork.

Transactions aren’t entirely free. They incur a tiny fraction of a cent fee to pay for “gas” that covers the cost of processing the transfer of funds similar to with Ethereum. This fee will be negligible to most consumers, but when they add up, the gas charges will deter bad actors from creating millions of transactions to power spam and denial-of-service attacks. “We’ve purposely tried not to innovate massively on the blockchain itself because we want it to be scalable and secure,” says Marcus of piggybacking on the best elements of existing cryptocurrencies.

Currently, the Libra Blockchain is what’s known as “permissioned,” where only entities that fulfill certain requirements are admitted to a special in-group that defines consensus and controls governance of the blockchain. The problem is this structure is more vulnerable to attacks and censorship because it’s not truly decentralized. But during Facebook’s research, it couldn’t find a reliable permissionless structure that could securely scale to the number of transactions Libra will need to handle. Adding more nodes slows things down, and no one has proven a way to avoid that without compromising security.

That’s why the Libra Association’s goal is to move to a permissionless system based on proof-of-stake that will protect against attacks by distributing control, encourage competition and lower the barrier to entry. It wants to have at least 20% of votes in the Libra Association council coming from node operators based on their total Libra holdings instead of their status as a founding member. That plan should help appease blockchain purists who won’t be satisfied until Libra is completely decentralized.

Move coding language — for moving Libra

The Libra Blockchain is open source with an Apache 2.0 license, and any developer can build apps that work with it using the Move coding language. The blockchain’s prototype launches its testnet today, so it’s effectively in developer beta mode until it officially launches in the first half of 2020. The Libra Association is working with HackerOne to launch a bug bounty system later this year that will pay security researchers for safely identifying flaws and glitches. In the meantime, the Libra Association is implementing the Libra Core using the Rust programming language because it’s designed to prevent security vulnerabilities, and the Move language isn’t fully ready yet.

Move was created to make it easier to write blockchain code that follows an author’s intent without introducing bugs. It’s called Move because its primary function is to move Libra coins from one account to another, and never let those assets be accidentally duplicated. The core transaction code looks like: LibraAccount.pay_from_sender(recipient_address, amount) procedure.

Eventually, Move developers will be able to create smart contracts for programmatic interactions with the Libra Blockchain. Until Move is ready, developers can create modules and transaction scripts for Libra using Move IR, which is high-level enough to be human-readable but low-level enough to be translatable into real Move bytecode that’s written to the blockchain.

The Libra ecosystem and the Move language will be completely open to use and build, which presents a sizable risk. Crooked developers could prey on crypto novices, claiming their app works just the same as legitimate ones, and that it’s safe because it uses Libra. But if consumers get ripped off by these scammers, the anger will surely bubble up to Facebook. Yet still, Calibra’s head of product tells me, “There are no plans for the Libra Association to take a role in actively vetting [developers],” Calibra’s head of product Kevin Weil tells me.

Even though it’s tried to distance itself sufficiently via its subsidiary Libra and the association, many people will probably always think of Libra as Facebook’s cryptocurrency and blame it for their woes.

Libra incentives — rewarding early businesses

The Libra Association wants to encourage more developers and merchants to work with its cryptocurrency. That’s why it plans to issue incentives, possibly Libra coins, to validator node operators who can get people signed up for and using Libra. Wallets that pull users through the Know Your Customer anti-fraud and money laundering process or that keep users sufficiently active for over a year will be rewarded. For each transaction they process, merchants will also receive a percentage of the transaction back.

Businesses that earn these incentives can keep them, or pass some or all of them along to users in the form of free Libra tokens or discounts on their purchases. This could create competition between wallets to see which can pass on the most rewards to their customers, and thereby attract the most users. You could imagine eBay or Spotify giving you a discount for paying in Libra, while wallet developers might offer you free tokens if you complete 100 transactions within a year.

“One challenge for Spotify and its users around the world has been the lack of easily accessible payment systems – especially for those in financially underserved markets,” Spotify’s Chief Premium Business Officer Alex Norström writes. “In joining the Libra Association, there is an opportunity to better reach Spotify’s total addressable market, eliminate friction and enable payments in mass scale.”

This savvy incentive system should massively help ratchet up Libra’s user count without dictating how businesses balance their margins versus growth. Facebook also has another plan to grow its developer ecosystem. By offering venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures a portion of the reserve interest, they’re motivating to fund startups building Libra infrastructure.

Using Libra

So how do you actually own and spend Libra? Through Libra wallets like Facebook’s own Calibra and others that will be built by third-parties, potentially including Libra Association members like PayPal. The idea is to make sending money to a friend or paying for something as easy as sending a Facebook Message. You won’t be able to make or receive any real payments until the official launch next year, though, but you can sign up for early access when it’s ready here.

None of the Libra Association members agreed to provide details on what exactly they’ll build on the blockchain, but we can take Facebook’s Calibra wallet as an example of the basic experience. Calibra will launch alongside the Libra currency on iOS and Android within Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and a standalone app. When users first sign up, they’ll be taken through a Know Your Customer anti-fraud process where they’ll have to provide a government-issued photo ID and other verification info. They’ll need to conduct due diligence on customers and report suspicious activity to the authorities.

From there you’ll be able to cash in to Libra, pick a friend or merchant, set an amount to send them and add a description and send them Libra. You’ll also be able to request Libra, and Calibra will offer an expedited way of paying merchants by scanning your or their QR code. Eventually it wants to offer in-store payments and integrations with point-of-sale systems like Square.

The Libra Association’s e-commerce members seem particularly excited about how the token could eliminate transaction fees and speed up checkout. “We believe blockchain will benefit the luxury industry by improving IP protection, transparency in the product life cycle and — as in the case of Libra — enable global frictionless e-commerce,” says FarFetch CEO Jose Neves.

Privacy — at least from Facebook

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained some of the philosophy behind Libra and Calibra in a post today. “It’s decentralized — meaning it’s run by many different organizations instead of just one, making the system fairer overall. It’s available to anyone with an internet connection and has low fees and costs. And it’s secured by cryptography which helps keep your money safe. This is an important part of our vision for a privacy-focused social platform — where you can interact in all the ways you’d want privately, from messaging to secure payments.”

By default, Facebook won’t import your contacts or any of your profile information, but may ask if you wish to do so. It also won’t share any of your transaction data back to Facebook, so it won’t be used to target you with ads, rank your News Feed, or otherwise earn Facebook money directly. Data will only be shared in specific instances in anonymized ways for research or adoption measurement, for hunting down fraudsters or due to a request from law enforcement. And you don’t even need a Facebook or WhatsApp account to sign up for Calibra or to use Libra.

“We realize people don’t want their social data and financial data commingled,” says Marcus, who’s now head of Calibra. “The reality is we’ll have plenty of wallets that will compete with us and many of them will not be in social, and if we want to successfully win people’s trust, we have to make sure the data will be separated.”

In case you are hacked, scammed or lose access to your account, Calibra will refund you for lost coins when possible through 24/7 chat support because it’s a custodial wallet. You also won’t have to remember any long, complex crypto passwords you could forget and get locked out from your money, as Calibra manages all your keys for you. Given Calibra will likely become the default wallet for many Libra users, this extra protection and smoother user experience is essential.

For now, Calibra won’t make money. But Calibra’s head of product Kevin Weil tells me that if it reaches scale, Facebook could launch other financial tools through Calibra that it could monetize, such as investing or lending. “In time, we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass,” the Calibra team writes. That makes it start to sound a lot like China’s everything app WeChat.

A global coin

Facebook got one thing right for sure: Today’s money doesn’t work for everyone. Those of us living comfortably in developed nations likely don’t see the hardships that befall migrant workers or the unbanked abroad. Preyed on by greedy payday lenders and high-fee remittance services, targeted by muggers and left out of traditional financial services, the poor get poorer. Libra has the potential to get more money from working parents back to their families and help people retain credit even if they’re robbed of their physical possessions. That would do more to accomplish Facebook’s mission of making the world feel smaller than all the News Feed Likes combined.

If Facebook succeeds and legions of people cash in money for Libra, it and the other founding members of the Libra Association could earn big dividends on the interest. And if suddenly it becomes super quick to buy things through Facebook using Libra, businesses will boost their ad spend there. But if Libra gets hacked or proves unreliable, it could cost lots of people around the world money while souring them on cryptocurrencies. And by offering an open Libra platform, shady developers could build apps that snatch not just people’s personal info like Cambridge Analytica, but their hard-earned digital cash.

Facebook just tried to reinvent money. Next year, we’ll see if the Libra Association can pull it off. It took me 4,000 words to explain Libra, but at least now you can make up your own mind about whether to be scared of Facebook crypto.",2019-06-18,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/the-difference-between-bitcoin-and-facebooks-libra.html,"The cryptocurrency industry cannot get enough of Libra, touting its ability to gain mainstream adoption which bitcoin strived to do for years. ""Libra is potentially one of the most positive external tailwinds in Bitcoin in its 10-year history,"" said Spencer Bogart, of Blockchain Capital to CNBC over email. However there are differences between bitcoin and Libra and it stems from their use case.

Bogart explains that Libra is a medium-of-exchange where users can send money and house transactions. Bitcoin, while it attempted to became a platform for facilitating transactions, has been regarded as more of an investment and store-of-value. Michael Moro of Genesis Capital, among others, still calls bitcoin ""digital gold.""

Adoption

Libra is coming to market with a lot of powerful players behind it…including Mastercard, Uber, Booking Holdings, Visa, which Cannacord Genuity says should help Libra achieve mass adoption. ""There's [a] good opportunity to get a lot of adoption…whereas bitcoin was a grass roots experiment that is still in development,"" said Michael Graham, analyst at Canaccord Genuity to CNBC. Libra's low fee transaction should incentivize customers to use the token to send money, analysts said. Bitcoin, on the other hand, got more expensive and slower in conducting transactions. ""Libra is meant to be built from the ground up to be fast and inexpensive to transact with…huge difference because it still costs a lot to trade bitcoin, said Graham.

Volatility",2019-06-18,https://capital.com/ethereum-vs-bitcoin,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/bitcoin-is-easily-going-to-take-out-its-all-time-highs-tom-lee.html,"Bitcoin appears to be back in business.

Having crossed above the $9,000 level on Sunday ahead of Facebook announcing its own cryptocurrency, Libra, bitcoin is now up 146% this year. But that could be just the beginning for its bounce back, says bitcoin bull and Fundstrat Global Advisors' research chief Tom Lee.

""I think bitcoin is easily going to take out its all-time highs"" of $20,000, and has the potential to run to $40,000 if its use cases grow, Lee said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""We're deep into a bull market, and people are pretty silent about it.""

In his latest note, Lee wrote that he felt there was a lack of conviction about bitcoin's recent rally, based on his attendance at the CryptoCompare Digital Asset Summit in London last week.

Many in the crypto space were hesitant to agree that the ""crypto winter"" was indeed over, Lee wrote. They cited worries around persistent volatility in alt-coins and initial coin offerings, fundraising issues in the digital currency market, general bearishness and residual concerns stemming from crypto's huge drop in 2018, he wrote.

But Facebook's latest move serves to legitimize the space in a way that could provide further runway for bitcoin, which could even become a ""reserve currency in crypto"" down the line, Lee said Tuesday.

""The Facebook announcement is a complete validation that mainstream is now focused on cryptocurrencies,"" he said. ""I think it really destroys those arguments that say, 'I believe in blockchain, not bitcoin.'""

And, while Lee saw Facebook's Libra project as ""clearly a cryptocurrency play,"" the main thrust of it revolves around the idea of decentralized finance, he said.

""I think it is more targeted at stablecoin and creating a new kind of banking system, and it's very complementary to bitcoin,"" he said. ""So I think this is actually a really bullish development for bitcoin. I think it's really bad for stablecoins and anyone who's been trying to do decentralized finance.""

Facebook's project has the backing of payment processors Mastercard and Visa, as well as travel giant Booking Holdings. Lee noted that decentralization in finance is ""probably really good for payment processors"" but will likely pose a challenge to traditionally structured banks.

""One thing to keep in mind [is] Facebook's annual revenue per user is probably $50. That might be a little high,"" Lee said. ""But an average bank generates close to $1,000 per user. So, Facebook has a 20x upside to their customer model if they start doing banking services, and so I can see why banks aren't really enthusiastic about this.""

Bitcoin was down nearly 3% toward the end of Tuesday's trading session. The digital currency managed to retrace its 2018 highs in late May.

Disclaimer",2019-06-18,https://www.coindesk.com/binance-to-launch-bitcoin-pegged-token-on-its-own-blockchain,"Binance will issue a number of tokens pegged to leading cryptocurrencies on Binance Chain to boost the number of trading options on its platform.

The tokens are also likely to be extended to Binance DEX, the firm’s recently launched decentralized exchange, as they create the potential to in effect move cryptos from different blockchains onto its network.

The company said in a blog post that it expects to release the first such token – one pegged to bitcoin and to be listed as BTCB – in the coming days. A trading pair will be created on Binance.com between the pegged token and bitcoin (BTCB/BTC).

The crypto-pegged tokens, based on the exchange’s BEP2 format, will be backed by Binance’s reserves of the pegged cryptocurrency. Before the news was announced Monday, CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao tweeted a warning of an impending move of bitcoin for the purpose.

There will be a transfer of 9001 BTC soon, no need to FUD. It’s for a good thing, details to follow. Waiting for whale_alert. — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) June 17, 2019



Binance explained in the post:

“Large buy orders will be maintained on the trading pair on Binance.com, with a price spread of around 0.1%. This provides an easy way for anyone to convert from the pegged token back into the native coin on Binance.com. If this buy order is filled, a new order will be placed while an equal amount of funds will be deposited from the reserve address into Binance.com. The sum of the buy order and the funds on the published reserve address will be bigger than the total supply of the pegged token, ensuring there is always 100% backing.”

The Binance team reasoned that the increase in the selection of tokens available on Binance DEX will increase trading volume and liquidity, thereby furthering the utility and value of the platform.

Also noteworthy is that Binance is eschewing the option to use to cross-chain atomic swaps or other decentralized approaches to enable exchanges of non-native tokens on the DEX.

The company said:

“While this approach is more centralized than atomic swaps, we believe it provides a higher degree of ease-of-use to most traders. And most traders are already trusting Binance.com to hold their funds anyway.”

In the post, the firm said that the new tokens are “proposed” for launch on Binance DEX currently.

Additionally, because the reserve addresses will be published on the blockchain, Binance said the new crypto-pegged tokens will be easier to audit than traditional bank reserves.

The company is encouraging clients to issue pegged tokens of their own coins on the Binance Chain, offering (though not guaranteeing) to facilitate a pegged/native pair.

Earlier this month, Binance also confirmed to Bloomberg that it would soon launch stablecoins on its chain too.

Chief financial officer, Wei Zhou, said the first stablecoin offering, to be linked to the British pound, will be live on the platform “in a matter of weeks to a month or two.”

Throughout the past six months, seven crypto exchanges have reportedly seen large-scale hacking attacks to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, with the most recent platform to suffer a security breach being GateHub.

As the global crypto exchange market continues to see an increasing number of security breaches leading to the loss of user funds, investors may become reluctant to rely on centralized exchanges to store funds.

Bitrue hack

The month of June was characterized by two unfortunate cryptocurrency thefts. On June 26, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitrue has acknowledged the fact that it suffered a major attack in which 9.3 million XRP and 2.5 million ADA worth around $5 million at the time were stolen from the exchange’s hot wallets. The statement read:

“A hacker exploited a vulnerability in our Risk Control team's 2nd review process to access the personal funds of about 90 Bitrue users.”

The exchange also clarified in the thread that all users who lost their digital assets will be compensated, while also apologizing for initially misleading their users by saying that the platform was down for maintenance. Bitrue also provided a link to track the movement of the stolen funds and also acknowledged that it reached out to Singaporean authorities in order to track down the culprits.

GateHub — 18,473 accounts affected

As reported by Cointelegraph on June 6, the United Kingdom and Slovenia-based crypto exchange GateHub reported the loss of nearly $10 million worth of XRP.

In an update published on June 7, the GateHub team noted that an unidentified hacker used a sophisticated method to gain access to a database holding users’ access tokens and steal their funds. In the aftermath, GateHub said:

“Through a well-orchestrated attack, the perpetrator gained access to a database holding valid access tokens of our customers. We detected an increased volume of API calls (using these valid access tokens) coming from a small number of IP addresses.”

The exchange told its users that it will cooperate with its internal response team, law enforcement agencies, third-party professional security and forensics teams, and investigative authorities to analyze the breach and to potentially find the individual or a group responsible for the breach.

Insurance is just as important as security measures

Over the years, despite the efforts of exchanges to ramp up security measures and improve internal management systems, hackers have been able to deploy more sophisticated and advanced technologies to gain unauthorized access into corporate wallets and user accounts.

In some instances, as seen in the case of Binance’s $40 million security breach, it is difficult even for the biggest crypto exchanges in the world — with in-house security experts — to prevent unexpected breaches.

However, it is possible for exchanges to set up systems that allow for the speedy recovery of user funds.

Related reading: The Cryptopia Nightmare Drags on as Liquidators Struggle to Reimburse Hacked Users

Binance, for instance, established the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) in July 2018 to compensate users in the unlikely event of a hacking attack. Binance said in July 2018:

“Starting from 2018/07/14, we will allocate 10% of all trading fees received into SAFU to offer protection to our users and their funds in extreme cases. This fund will be stored in a separate cold wallet.”

Two types of wallets exist in crypto: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are wallets that are connected to the internet and that are easily accessible. Cold wallets are wallets stored offline and are used by major exchanges to securely store reserves of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

Cold wallets cannot be hacked because they are not connected to the internet — and as such, exchanges hold the overwhelming majority of their reserves in cold wallets.

Still, despite having advanced security measures in place, hot wallets can be vulnerable to attacks, so it is ideal for an exchange to establish an insurance fund that is equivalent to the amount held in its hot wallet to prevent a security breach in the future affecting the exchange’s operations.

Such a practice does not prevent an exchange from suffering a hacking attack, but it minimizes the magnitude of an incident's impact on the exchange and facilitates the recovery process to be more structured and apparent.

The largest crypto exchanges in the global market — the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Gemini — have either obtained insurance from third-party service providers or have internal insurance funds in place to compensate users, should an unexpected incident arise.

Coinbase, for example, notes that it maintains a reserve that is larger than its online storage with third-party insurance. The insurance document of Coinbase reads:

“Coinbase maintains commercial criminal insurance in an aggregate amount that is greater than the value of digital currency we maintain in online storage. Our insurance policy is made available through a combination of third-party insurance underwriters and Coinbase, who is a co-insurer under the policy.”

Gemini obtained the insurance services of Aon and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in October 2018, and Yusuf Hussain, Gemini’s head of risk, said at the time:

“Consumers are looking for the same levels of insured protection they’re used to being afforded by traditional financial institutions. Educating our insurers not only allows us to provide such protections to our customers, but it also sets the expectation for consumer protection across the crypto industry.”

Communication between exchanges is crucial

Since hot wallets or online storage can become vulnerable to security breaches, it is of the utmost importance for exchanges to establish a line of communication with other platforms to trace and potentially freeze transactions when suspicious funds begin to move.

According to the GateHub team, some of the funds stolen in the $10 million security breach were sent to exchanges such as Kucoin, Huobi and HitBTC, all of which have Know Your Customer (KYC) policies in place. GateHub acknowledged this fact:

“The funds were sent to several exchanges, including Freewallet.org, Changelly, Changenow, Kucoin, Huobi, Exmo, Hitbtc, Binance, Alfacashier and others. We have already contacted each recipient exchange with the aim to freeze and retrieve all customer assets.”

If exchanges have an efficient system to communicate when unforeseen events occur, it becomes possible for them to immediately suspend wallets that received the proceeds from a potential hacking attack and swiftly begin recovering funds.

In January 2018, South Korea’s four largest crypto exchanges — Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone and Korbit — created a hotline for major exchanges to ensure suspicious transactions could be detected and frozen immediately after being disclosed.

Transactions on public blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are traceable due to the decentralized structure of the blockchain. Major exchanges are already working with analytics firms such as Chainalysis to maintain a database of suspicious transactions and wallets.

The presence of a hotline among major crypto exchanges in the global market would create a significantly more impractical ecosystem for hackers to distribute proceeds from an attack to various exchanges.

Why systems must improve

In previous years, most crypto-related hacking attacks were suffered by minor exchanges that typically could not afford to have an in-house security team and advanced measures in place.

However, in the past six months, major crypto exchanges such as Binance, Bithumb and Coinmama have all fallen victim to security breaches, all of which have well over hundreds of thousands of users.

Bithumb, which is considered to be one of the two biggest crypto exchanges in South Korea (alongside UPbit), was hacked in March for the third time in two years, in what the exchange suspects to be an insider job.

The Bithumb team said:

“According to the company's manual, Bithumb secured all the cryptocurrency from the detection time with a cold wallet and checked them by blocking deposit and withdrawal service. As a result of the internal inspection, it is judged that the incident is an ‘accident involving insiders’. Based on the facts, we are conducting intensive investigations with KISA, Cyber Police Agency and security companies.”

Last year, cybersecurity company Group-IB reported that seven crypto exchanges were hacked in 2018, with the largest breach suffered by Coincheck leading to the loss of a staggering $534 million worth in crypto.

Less than six months into 2019, and already seven crypto exchanges have been successfully hacked — excluding the CoinBene incident, which some suspect may also be a hacking attack.

Related to this: Major Crypto Exchange in Korea Shut Down in April: 2018 Was a Nightmare for Most

In March, cryptocurrency researcher Nick Schteringard said that $6 million worth of coinbene coin and $39 million in maximine were stolen from the CoinBene exchange.

Blockchain infrastructure firm Elementus said in a report that the funds were quickly sold for ether (ETH) on Etherdelta, fueling the suspicions of investors about the incident. According to the report:

“After leaving CoinBene, the tokens were quickly moved into Etherdelta, where they were sold for ETH. A large amount of funds were also moved into centralized Exchanges, including Binance, Huobi, and Bittrex. The funds continue to move into exchanges as I write this.”

In April, CoinBene stated that the movement of tens of millions of dollars in coinbene coin and maximine coin was due to a maintenance the exchange carried out, denying any cyber attacks on its platform.

A troubling trend?

The worrying trend in the crypto exchange market is that, within the first six months of 2019, the industry has seen the same number of hacking attacks as in the whole of the previous year, and the security breaches in 2019 were mainly experienced by large-scale exchanges.

In the upcoming months and years, the methods and technologies utilized by hackers will continue to become more sophisticated and advanced.

While it is challenging to completely prevent unauthorized access, especially in the case of hot wallets, it is possible for exchanges to have proper insurance, an in-house security team and back-up reserves equivalent to the amount of crypto held in online storage to prevent users from being affected in the event of a security breach.",,https://www.coindesk.com/70-of-crypto-exchanges-have-complied-with-coinmarketcaps-transparency-initiative,"Crypto data provider CoinMarketCap says most listed exchanges have complied with its transparency-boosting mandatory data requests.

The news marks the end of the first phase of the site’s Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA) initiative, which pushes for stricter disclosures, which include live trading and order book data. More accurate, timely and unbiased information will enable site users to draw more informed conclusions from CoinMarketCap data, the firm said in a statement.

“The new and detailed criteria for listings will provide clear and concrete guidelines for everyone looking to be listed on CoinMarketCap,” said Carylyne Chan, global head of marketing at CoinMarketCap. “We want to be as exhaustive as possible, eventually listing every qualifying project and exchange on CoinMarketCap!”

Currently listed cryptocurrency exchanges were given 45 days to respond and submit the queried information beginning on May 1.

The company confirmed over the weekend that 70.3 percent of all currently listed exchanges have fulfilled the expected requirements, and will continue to be included in CoinMarketCap’s calculations of volume-weighted average price and adjusted trading volume.

“We are highly encouraged after seeing strong support for our DATA initiative so far,” said Chan. “With these submitted data points, we aim to provide more meaningful analyses and metrics for our users, and empower them with information to do their own research even more effectively.”

Exchanges that have not submitted the requisite information will be listed below those that have done so on the rankings. However, firms that submit the requested data will have their positions restored on a rolling basis.

CoinMarketCap also intends to bolster its “previously laconic listing requirements,” by expanding the set of measures that it uses to evaluate projects and exchanges, including factors such as trading volume, community interest, traction, team, product-market fit, impact, uniqueness and time in market.

While listing requirements are becoming more stringent, CoinMarketCap has also unveiled an “untracked listing” category, so projects that miss the minimum requirements for tracking market data can still appear on the website. To progress into the more dignified “tracked listing,” companies will have to “exhibit strengths in a number of areas [during] the revised evaluation.”

The company is also championing transparency within its own internal strategies, for the first time publishing its delisting policy. Some notable causes for delisting include “low liquidity or suspicious trading activity, cessation of business, and misleading or deceptive initial applications that were later found out, unlawful activity,” according to the statement.

CoinMarketCap is currently preparing for its first DATA roundtable with alliance partners, slated for sometime in mid July. Discussion topics may include standardization of definitions, tickers, and data disclosures via API, as well as confirming the DATA Phase 2 metrics to be collected.

CoinMarketCap image via Shutterstock",2019-06-18 12:30:18+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/fidelity-backed-crypto-analytics-firm-to-integrate-twitter-based-crypto-sentiment-feed,"Crypto analytics firm Coin Metrics partnered with Social Market Analytics (SMA) to collaborate on a feed of real-time sentiment towards cryptocurrency based on social media data, according to a press release on June 17.

The new partnership intends to collect and analyze data posted by crypto community on social media in order to provide a new tool to help crypto traders to track social media sentiment data to build their portfolio strategies.

The new product will initially target sentiment data solely on social media giant Twitter, Coin Metrics CEO Tim Rice confirmed to Cointelegraph, adding that the firms are currently not considering integration of the service into Facebook.

Specifically,Coin Metrics will incorporate the product into market data platform, called the SMA cryptocurrency Sentiment Feed, providing calculated metrics of data on Twitter, according to a report by crypto media outlet The Block. In the report, Rice said that the calculation algorithms would include relevant tweets and calculate “19 different aggregate sentiment metrics down to snapshots of one minute.”

Social Market Analytics is providing social media-powered predictive data analytics to traditional capital markets participants in various markets, including stocks, forex, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), futures, among others. Since its establishment in 2012, SMA has been a Twitter Finance partner, the firm’s CEO Joe Gits stated in an email to Cointelegraph.

Meanwhile, Coin Metrics is backed by major American investment management company Fidelity in February 2019, which participated in a $1.9 million funding round in February 2019.

Earlier today, social media giant Facebook released the white paper for its long-anticipated cryptocurrency and blockchain-powered financial project known as Libra stablecoin.",

The new currency will be a cryptocurrency similar to bitcoin. A cryptocurrency is a kind of money that does not exist in the form of bills or coins. Governments and banks do not oversee the money. Instead, it is exchanged digitally between buyers and sellers using secret codes for security.

A network of computers records cryptocurrency activity between users. The activity is included in a “ledger,” or list, known as the blockchain. The blockchain permits the activity records to be checked and stored securely. People keep their cryptocurrency in digital wallets that operate in a way similar to online banks.

Facebook is calling its cryptocurrency Libra. It expects to launch the service publicly in the first half of next year.

The U.S.-based social media service says Libra will be available to anyone with a smartphone and internet connection. “Moving money around the world should be as easy and cheap as sending a text message,” Facebook says on its website. “No matter where you live, what you do, or how much you earn.”

The company says it especially wants to reach an estimated 1.7 billion “unbanked” people across the world who currently do not use a bank. Costs to use Libra will be lower than what other companies currently charge for the service, Facebook said. It has not yet released pricing information, however.

Facebook says its digital currency will differ in several ways from bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies in use today. Unlike the others, the company says, Libra’s value will be tied to real money backed by banks and government securities in major currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro, yen and others.

The Libra system will also be supported by several traditional financial companies, including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and eBay. Facebook set up the Switzerland-based not-for-profit Libra Association to govern the activities of the digital currency.

The company says these changes are aimed at improving trust and preventing major valuation changes of the Libra. Investors in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of sharp price drops and computer attacks.

Facebook created a separate company, called Calibra, to operate the Calibra wallet system. The wallet is used to store, send and receive Libras. Calibra will be available as an app on smartphones or directly from Facebook’s Messenger and WhatsApp products.

Facebook said it had taken major steps to create a system that is private and secure. People using Calibra will first have to go through a process to confirm their identities.

The company says Calibra will only share user information with parent company Facebook and third parties when it receives user permission to do so. User information might also be shared in some other “limited cases,” such as when law enforcement requests information, Facebook said in a statement.

Facebook has promised not to use any Calibra data to improve targeting of its advertising. Businesses will see the same information about users who pay with Libra as they do about users paying with credit cards, the company said.

Even with such statements and promises, Facebook is likely to face serious questions about its new cryptocurrency system from lawmakers in the United States and other countries. Some American lawmakers have already proposed that Facebook face new rules or penalties – or possibly even be forcibly broken up - for major incidents involving the misuse of private user data.

ATMs for transactions in virtual currencies are appearing in Western countries, digital money can be bought and sold on the Internet and many serious financial analytics companies have started tracking digital currency fluctuations and investment forecasts.



Like any other means of payment, Bitcoin, even without being a secured currency, is integrated into the existing economy. So, like everyone, carries certain risks. So far, the future of virtual currency seems promising. However, unexpected drops in the rate make even the most seasoned investors be wary.



Warren Buffett (Warren Buffett) once said that he did not share the general enthusiasm for Bitcoin. In his opinion, this is a “mirage, a soap bubble,” and Buffett decisively does not understand either the essence of this cryptocurrency or the causes of the hype around it. Since a person whose whole life was closely connected with economics and finance, will not begin to talk in vain, it is necessary, at a minimum, to study all the risks associated with working with cryptocurrency.



Experimental phase risk



It should be noted that the concept of cryptocurrencies itself is innovative - there are no historical data and experience that allow you to assess how much you can trust it. Bitcoin, like other cryptocurrencies, is still under development. Thus, something completely unexpected could happen to it, which invariably happens at the development stage not only with economic objects but also with experimental technologies. However, being the most actively used cryptocurrency, it is less “experimental” than other counterparts. In addition, relative to traditional assets, its level can be assessed as high because this asset is not intended for conservative investors.



Technology Risks



The technological component always develops very quickly, and often even uncontrollably. Any user knows that Bitcoin already exists - and continues to appear almost daily - a huge number of competitors. Despite the advantage due to brand awareness and large venture capital injections, there is a real technological risk to other cryptocurrencies in the form of the potential appearance of a more advanced cryptocurrency. Investors may simply not notice the moment when their virtual assets lose their real value.



Price variability



Bitcoin cost fluctuations are completely unpredictable in the short term, which only adds to the riskiness of this asset. Financial analysts can more or less accurately predict the value of real currencies or stock quotes based on data from the outside world. But to predict exactly how much Bitcoin will cost tomorrow is almost impossible. Factors causing the variability of the value of cryptocurrency are the large volumes of exchange trading, the integration of Bitcoin with various companies, legislative initiatives of regulatory bodies and many other, sometimes disregarded phenomena. To invest in blockchain technology, you should meet with blockchain companies to hire blockchain developers.



Consumer Protection



The unpleasant fact - Bitcoin does not provide any consumer protection. A perfect transaction cannot be undone. All that remains after a failed transaction is to try to convince the recipient of funds to return them voluntarily. This is due to the fact that there is no intermediary guarantor, as is the case with bank cards. Bitcoin transactions are similar to regular cash transactions, in which there are only 2 parties. However, the property of the irreversibility of transactions in itself has little effect on the risks of investing in Bitcoin as an asset. However, the investor must also be aware of this danger.



Theft or loss through negligence



If the attacker gains access to the investor’s private secret key, he can steal the entire contents of the digital wallet. Among Bitcoin users, there are cases when, due to their own ignorance or unfortunate coincidence, they lost access to secret keys - and consequently, to their own Bitcoin wallets. In addition, the hard disk of the computer on which the cryptocurrency details is stored may break down in a trivial way, and the awkward movement will result in the deletion of the key file. To invest in blockchain technology, you should meet with blockchain companies to hire blockchain developers.



Currency regulation



Depending on the country, there are a variety of approaches to regulating Bitcoin. The absence of a well-thought-out unified system for regulating cryptocurrencies only increases the uncertainty factor regarding their future. Government agencies in many countries are concerned about using Bitcoin for speculation, money laundering, drug trafficking, and other illegal financial transactions. At the same time, with the growth of the popularity of cryptocurrencies, state structures are beginning to actively come up with various legislative initiatives that in one way or another regulate the turnover of Bitcoin and other similar currencies.



Virtual Currency Frauds



A risk is normal for owners financial assets. Potential investors should be wary if someone promises them guaranteed high profitability; offers to buy Bitcoin, when no one laid out offers to sell them; when buying or selling is surprisingly “good,” or unknown persons attempt to create a false sense of urgency of investment, leaving no time for calm thought. This risk is associated with both real currency transactions and exchange trading.



Summing up



Investing in Bitcoin today is a very risky undertaking. There is no guarantee of minimum profitability or, at least, break-even investments. All investors who are going to work with cryptocurrency today must understand what the currency is about and have a clear plan of action for all sorts of scenarios. In addition, an inexperienced investor should invest only the amounts that he is willing to lose without serious consequences. To invest in blockchain technology, you should meet with blockchain companies to hire blockchain developers.



Post by Urvish Macwan, Marketing Manager at Hyperlink InfoSystem, listed as one of the top app development companies by leading research platform.",2019-06-19 10:32:13,https://cointelegraph.com/news/brazil-requires-crypto-exchanges-to-report-on-user-transactions-to-authorities,"The Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil (RFB) has released new rules requiring that cryptocurrency exchanges inform the regulator about users' transactions in order to identify tax fraud, Cointelegraph Brazil reported on June 19.

The guidelines clarify how cryptocurrency trading platforms in Brazil should adopt new rules to report about the movements of users' crypto funds to the agency, and comply with the requirements of Normative Instruction 1.888/2019 published in May of this year.

Specifically, the agency requires that cryptocurrency exchanges operators based in Brazil provide information about all transactions carried out within their system, while those platforms based abroad must provide information ""whenever the monthly value of the operations, alone or jointly, exceed 30,000.00 Brazilian reals [$7,750].""

Apart from the volume of a transaction, exchange operators must also provide data such as the nationality of the digital currency holder, their residence or domicile, registration number and the crypto assets used in a transaction.

Also according to the rules, all required information must be provided within a specified period, ""until 23:59:59, Brasilia time, on the last calendar month subsequent to that in which the operation took place."" The new rules will come into force in September 2019.

When the RFB announced that it was forming the requirements for cryptocurrency exchanges, Ismair Junior Couto, legal director of the Bitcoin Banco Group — Brazil's largest cryptocurrency broker — said the initiative had long been expected. He added that Bitcoin Banco had made provisions to provide the required information to authorities.

On May 31, Cointelegraph Brazil reported that the President of the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil ordered a commission to be created to consider cryptocurrency regulation in the country. The commission will be tasked with regulating local activities around Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets, and is reportedly expected to be composed of 34 members in accordance with the House Rules of Procedure.",,https://www.coindesk.com/regulators-begin-to-debate-cryptocurrency-legislation-ahead-of-g20-summit,"Cryptocurrency regulation will take a step forward during the upcoming V20 Summit where country representatives will assess the new course of legal action proposed by the international Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

FATF will release proposals on June 21 in hopes of setting new international standards for crypto businesses.

Legislators support the summit, which will also bring together national blockchain associations and the world’s leading Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).

FATF standards for blockchain and cryptocurrency have set high expectations among legislators. Of special interest is its impact on long-lasting financial security issues, a subject addressed by Japanese Congressman, Naokazu Takemoto.

“The VASP industry recognizes the importance of clear regulation in preventing financial crime and mitigating corruption,” Takemoto said.

The event, which will run parallel to G20 Summit on June 28 and 29 in Osaka, Japan, takes a new dimension by being held at the only country to have a legal framework for cryptocurrencies.

The latest examples given by Japanese regulators include measures to tighten restrictions on speculative trade and new obligations for exchanges, such as keeping a cryptocurrency protection fund.

Regulatory Concerns

While regulators agree on the need to control cryptocurrency businesses, too much regulation could backfire.

According Roger Wilkins, FTAF ex-president and former secretary Australian Department of the Attorney General, a common concern is that new regulations could push the public out of controlled platforms.

“What we are hearing from industry is that the new rules may have the opposite effect to which they were intended, effectively forcing crypto transactions off the controlled platforms, which are currently one of the best avenues we have in gaining visibility over financial crime,” Wilkins said.

Blockchain association representatives from China, South Korea, United Kingdom, Singapore and Australia will also be present at the event to review the new standard. Prior to that, the blockchain industry will know for sure if it will face real oppression from the international body.

In the mean time, legislators agree in the necessity for a balance in order to adapt and take advantage of the upcoming regulations. Nonetheless, is well-known that there’s no such thing as flexibility or non-compliance when it comes to following FATF recommendations.

“As a former regulator, I recognise how important it is to identify a balanced solution that implements the recommendations of the FATF while also building the opportunity for business,” Wilkins said.",2019-06-19 18:30:01+00:00,https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/multi-asset-crypto-wallet/,"With the rise of the altcoin market a few years after bitcoin was launched, the demand for multi-asset cryptocurrency wallets started to increase.

An Indian startup has launched a marketplace for algorithmic trading strategies. Investors can choose a strategy based on factors such as past performance, cryptocurrencies invested, and time frames. The platform also offers a drag-and-drop tool for traders to build their own strategies without writing code. News.Bitcoin.com talked to the company’s CEO to find out more about the platform.

Trading Strategy Marketplace Launch

Mudrex, an Indian startup which provides tools and resources for traders to build algorithmic trading strategies without writing code, launched a marketplace for trading strategies Wednesday. The marketplace can be accessed through the Mudrex website as well as on Product Hunt. Noting that “Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile,” CEO Rohit Goyal explained to news.Bitcoin.com that his platform aims “to help people invest in crypto algorithmically and safeguard them from this volatility.” He elaborated:

Casual investors can choose from a variety of available strategies based on their past performance. The strategy then automatically buys and sells cryptocurrencies on their behalf.

Based in the U.S. and India, the Y Combinator-backed startup with offices in Mountain View and Bangalore launched its main platform on Feb. 1 after being in closed beta from November last year. While the team initially wanted to launch a fiat-to-crypto exchange in India, the CEO said that is no longer the plan. “Instead we are in talks with multiple exchanges for an official partnership to work closely with them,” he shared. Currently, the startup has partnered with two exchanges: Bitmex and Binance.

Further, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banned financial institutions from providing services to crypto exchanges in its circular issued in April last year. A number of industry participants have filed writ petitions seeking the ban to be lifted. The country’s supreme court is set to hear the case on July 23. The court is also expected to hear about the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency from the government.

Building Algorithmic Trading Strategies

Mudrex provides a drag-and-drop tool for traders to create and iterate trading strategies which they can test and deploy for themselves. The platform offers over 140 prebuilt indicators and patterns for traders to use with three available markets: two on Binance and one on Bitmex. The Binance BTC markets offer 89 trading pairs while the Binance USDT markets offer 16 trading pairs. The XBT USD perpetual contract on Bitmex is also available.

Goyal explained to news.Bitcoin.com:

Traders create their trading strategies using an advanced drag-n-drop based UI editor with minimal programming required. They test their strategies on historical data and optimise the strategies accordingly.

“Once the strategies look good they [users] can put them on paper trading to see the live simulation and once satisfied, connect their exchange API keys to start trading with real money,” the CEO detailed, noting that the platform has already facilitated $3 million worth of cryptocurrency trades.

Users do not have to subscribe to use any of the platform’s tools, Goyal confirmed. However, he noted that “Starting August there will be a different subscription model including a free tier for traders who want to build strategies to use platform resources.”

About the Marketplace

Traders with high-performing strategies can submit them to be published in the marketplace and specify a monthly fee for others to use, Goyal described to news.Bitcoin.com. This will allow other traders to “invest in top performing strategies,” he remarked. At launch, there are eight strategies in the marketplace.

While any user can submit their trading strategies to be listed in the marketplace, every strategy has to go through a rigorous review process before the listing is approved. Goyal clarified, “The strategies submitted by traders [are] usually approved/rejected within 24 hours of their submission,” elaborating:

Once a strategy is approved, it gets listed on the marketplace and anyone else then can test them on historical data to see their past performance.

Any users can run backtests on any strategies listed in the marketplace and choose the best performing one based on factors such as market conditions, cryptocurrencies invested, and time frames.

“We now have 2,500 traders on board and a very highly engaged community of 500 traders to discuss trading ideas and help each other in building better strategies,” the CEO shared with news.Bitcoin.com, noting that “300 traders have been signing up every month so far.” He further revealed that, initially, the majority of his platform’s users were from India but over time more international users have signed up. He added that currently 27% of all users are from the U.S., 22% from India, 18% from Europe, and 10% from New Zealand and Australia.

Per the release, the tool newly added to PwC’s Halo auditing suite can be used to “provide assurance services for entities engaging in cryptocurrency transactions.” The firm claims that, with the new addition, the Halo suite permits PwC to provide independent evidence of private-public key pairing (to establish crypto asset ownership), and gather information about transactions and balances from blockchains.

PwC further notes that it is already employing the new tool to support audits of clients involved with cryptocurrencies, and assisting companies for which the firm is not the auditor in implementing processes and controls necessary to obtain assurance reports from their auditors. Still, the company notes that the tool is not without its limitations:

“Our ability to audit an entity engaged in cryptocurrency activities is very much influenced by our client’s control environment, and at this stage, by the breadth of tokens supported by our Halo software. These considerations will be key when determining whether we are comfortable to accept an audit engagement.”

Lastly, it is specified in the announcement that the new addition to the Halo suite supports bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin gold (BTG), bitcoin diamond (BCD), litecoin (LTC), ether (ETH), OAX (ERC20 token) and XRP.

As Cointelegraph reported at the time, PwC was the top recruiter for blockchain-related jobs on recruitment platform Indeed at the end of March.

“US citizens, domiciliaries or users from US IPs will no longer be able to use Bancor’s web application, https://www.bancor.network, to convert tokens,” the announcement noted. “This decision has been made in light of increased regulatory uncertainty; at this time, we believe this is the most judicious decision for all the members of our ecosystem.”

According to the company, this step will help it “to innovate faster and with greater clarity.”

The company also clarified that any clients, who have been identified as a US citizen and not staying in the country, cannot use its trading services, while people from overseas staying in the US can still trade on the platform.

However, Bancor users from the US can still access the blockchain.

“We would like to clarify that this functionality will be blocked to users accessing the website bancor.network, which offers an interface to blockchain activity. As the Bancor Liquidity Network is a collection of smart contracts on the blockchain and a non-custodial system, we cannot restrict users from accessing the blockchain itself. This cannot be blocked,” the announcement noted.

Its high time for clear regulatory laws

The uncertainty over crypto laws is forcing major companies to terminate their services in the country. Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in terms of trading volume, recently blocked access to its main website for the US-based traders. However, the company is launching a dedicated crypto-to-fiat exchange in the country.

What kind of stocks stir up controversy like no other? Penny stocks. These tickers trading for less than $5 per share have earned a reputation as some of the most divisive names on Wall Street, with these plays either met with open arms or given the cold shoulder.It’s understandable why some investors are wary. Those opposed are quick to point out that there could be a very real reason these stocks are changing hands for pocket change, with the low share prices often masking obstacles like weak fundamentals or troubling headwinds. That said, others are drawn in by the sheer growth potential of penny stocks. The fact is that even minor share price appreciation can mean huge percentage gains, and thus, serious returns. What’s more, your money goes further with these bargain names.No matter which side you take, one thing is certain, due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions. That’s where the experts come in, namely the analysts at Roth Capital. These pros bring experience and in-depth knowledge to the table.With this in mind, our focus turned to two penny stocks that have received a thumbs up from Roth Capital analysts. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, both have been cheered by the rest of the Street as well, as they boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Not to mention substantial upside potential is on the table.Cellectar Biosciences (CLRB)Leveraging its patented phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) delivery platform, Cellectar Biosciences develops cutting-edge treatments for cancer. Based on the potential of its drug candidate, CLR 131, and its $1.24 share price, Roth Capital thinks that now is the time to get in on the action.Representing the firm, analyst Jonathan Aschoff tells clients that he is optimistic about CLR 131, which is a small-molecule, targeted PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells, in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) indications. According to Aschoff, following its Type B guidance meeting with the FDA, “CLRB is prepared to initiate its first pivotal CLR 131 trial in LPL/WM after achieving a 100% ORR and 75% major response rate in four patients.” He points out that although CLRB just reported promising results in multiple myeloma (MM) (40% ORR in triple class refractory (TCR) patients at total body doses of at least 60mCi), LPL/WM was selected for the initial pivotal trial based on the very strong initial results and the lower competition for patients.“We view this as a prudent decision because NCCN compedia listing in MM is a mere peer-reviewed publication away, if first approved in LPL/WM. We also note that CLRB has steadily improved its dosing of CLR 131, essentially fractionating the doses so that higher total body doses are well tolerated,” Aschoff further explained. Adding to the good news, the therapy generated activity in preliminary Phase 1 unresectable brain tumors. Aschoff added, “Disease control was shown in two heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas, showing the drug's ability to cross the blood brain barrier, and all doses through 60 mCi/m2 have exhibited a favorable safety profile.”To this end, Aschoff rates CLRB a Buy along with a $10 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 713%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Aschoff’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. 5 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: CLRB is a Strong Buy. Given the $5.48 average price target, shares could soar 345% from current levels. (See CLRB stock analysis on TipRanks)Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC)With vast gene therapy experience, Applied Genetic Technologies designs and constructs all critical gene therapy elements and brings them together to develop successful treatments for patients. Currently going for $4.50 apiece, Roth Capital believes this stock’s long-term growth narrative is strong.Firm analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out that recently released data for its XLRP gene therapy program, which is expected to enter pivotal studies in Q1 2021, reaffirmed his bullish thesis. “Despite the market not fully appreciating the data given how the stock traded, we continue to believe that the results suggest that AGTC could have a best-in-class therapy, which is supportive of the planned pivotal efforts,” he explained.Providing an update on the results of the Phase 1/2 XLRP study, using the FDA's criteria, AGTC evaluated responses at 12 months in the lower dose groups (2 and 4), and 6 months in the higher dose groups (5 and 6). According to Jallah, “initial responses were observed in dose Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with impressive response durability even at 12 months.”On top of this, at 6 months, the dose used in Group 5 resulted in a 43% response rate or a 57% response rate if excluding a patient not meeting the enrollment criteria. In Group 6, a response rate of 50% was observed, or 100% excluding patients not meeting the enrollment criteria.Jallah added, “All measurements were obtained in the 36 perimetry grid, which we believe should make it easier to preselect loci likely to respond. Although BCVA is not the primary endpoint, BCVA improvements, which can capture changes in the central region, were maintained at 12 months.”Even though some investors have expressed concern about Meira’s competing therapy, Jallah believes AGTC’s technology could have a leg up. “Overall, we believe that the data from both companies is strongly indicative of the efficacy potential of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease, and although differences in the study design makes direct comparisons difficult, we believe that AGTC could have a competitive advantage heading into pivotal studies,” he commented.In line with his optimistic approach, Jallah reiterated a Buy rating and $30 price target, indicating 568% upside potential. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here)All in all, other analysts echo Jallah’s sentiment. 5 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $18.25 is less aggressive than Jallah’s but still leaves room for upside potential of 306%.

Two days after calling for a hearing, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) appeared on CNBC Thursday afternoon calling for a “moratorium” on Libra development.

“It’s very important for them to stop right now what they’re doing so that we can get a handle on this,” Waters said of the social media giant. “We’ve got to protect our consumers. We just can’t allow them to go to Switzerland with all of its associates and begin to compete with the dollar.”

CNBC’s Waters interview made it clear her concerns are more with Facebook than with the company’s announced cryptocurrency project. Waters highlighted an ongoing investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into potential privacy violations concerning consumer data. She also mentioned a Department of Housing and Urban Development lawsuit that accuses Facebook of violating fair housing laws.

“And while we’re doing that they have moved on to develop this cryptocurrency,” Waters said on CNBC. “We’re now going to move and we’re going to move aggressively and very quickly to deal with what is going on with this new cryptocurrency.”

Waters isn’t alone in calling for public hearings on Facebook’s crypto aspirations, which were announced Tuesday. The U.S. Senate’s banking committee has already scheduled a July 16 hearing on Libra. Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus is reportedly expected to testify, according to The Verge.

Talk of 10x returns during the hunt for the next Bitcoin and becoming rich overnight fill social media feeds.

However, Bitcoin dominance has only grown since it broke out of the deepest depths of the bear market back in early April, kicking off a parabolic run that has yet to see any significant correction. Now, after a recent pattern break, analysts are expecting a further rise in Bitcoin dominance and warn not to be fooled by bullish ALT/USD charts that are actually being driven by Bitcoin’s strength against the dollar.

Crypto Confusion: It’s a Bull Market for Bitcoin, but a Bear Market for Altcoins

According to crypto analysts, Bitcoin dominance charts show a break above resistance that could cause BTC dominance to “run to 70% soon.”

This chart really doesn't bode well for the altcoin bulls… Bitcoin dominance looks like it's going to run to 70% soon. pic.twitter.com/p4WAfLSATD — Felipe (@PhilCrypto77) June 20, 2019

The bearish sentiment extends into the public, who according to poll results believe that BTC dominance will rise “higher” above the current 57% dominance Bitcoin currently enjoys over the rest of the market.

Bitcoin dominance is 57%. This number eventually will be: — Dennis (@pourteaux) June 19, 2019

Being bearish on altcoins, especially the “major cap” altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin – which are all showing bullish signs on their USD price charts – is surprising. Altcoins are in their longest accumulation phase yet, and talk of an alt season continues to permeate across the market.

Another crypto analyst warns not to be “deceived” by Bitcoin doing well against the dollar and the effect it has on other altcoin price charts trading against USD.

Top 10 market cap coins vs $USD pair have nice bullish setups. Good looking flags. But all look horrible versus BTC. The strength versus the dollar is purely a function of Bitcoin doing well, do not be deceived in thinking total market cap up is money flow into entire sector. — Bob Loukas (@BobLoukas) June 19, 2019

Most altcoins across the market also trading against BTC and not just USD, causing their values to be tightly correlated to Bitcoin’s price movements relative to USD. This is why when Bitcoin rises or falls, altcoins can often be pulled right along with it.

Other times, altcoins diverge, which causes a rise in Bitcoin dominance. The trigger that causes this varies, but the likeliest factors influencing this trend change are the focus on Bitcoin over altcoins from institutions, and the recent news that Binance would be blocking US customers from its regular exchange and launching a US version sans many of the assets that made the platform attractive to investors in the first place.

Bitcoin price is currently roughly $9,350, and a break above $9,500 should set the path for the first attempt at $10,000.

As the name suggests, initial exchange offerings are conducted over crypto trading platforms and exchanges.

Binance was the first major cryptocurrency exchange to join the IEO wave, with the introduction of Binance Launchpad this year. A handful of IEOs has been done before but in much smaller exchanges.

In January, the Binance platform conducted the sale of the BitTorrent (BTT) token, or digital currency, raising $7 million in just the first 14 minutes of sale opening. San Francisco-based BitTorrent is a software company specializing in peer-to-peer file-sharing.

BACKGROUND ON CRYPTOCURRENCIES

Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency created in 2008. It is a form of electronic currency, independent of traditional banks, that allows users to send money directly from one computer to another even on another side of the world.

Bitcoin’s popularity fueled the creation of more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies and spurred the launch of an entire global industry on blockchain, a distributed ledger technology that drives it.

Cryptocurrencies are also traded on digital currency exchanges, which are all online, many of them available on mobile phone applications. People buy cryptocurrencies from these exchanges by just signing up from their websites.

Bitcoin on Thursday traded at $9,400 on the BitStamp exchange.

People buy cryptocurrencies primarily for speculation because they have gone up in price so much in the last three years. Some like developers buy specific currencies to gain access to certain networks that are relevant to them.

Since 2008, the biggest financial names have entered the cryptocurrency space, from IBM to Goldman Sachs, and most recently Facebook, which launched the blueprint for its own cryptocurrency on Tuesday.

But cryptocurrencies are risky. Because they are virtual currencies, they can be hacked or disappear forever if you lose the keys to the online wallets used to store them. And with no clear regulatory body overseeing the digital currency industry, funds would be difficult to recover once you lose them.

WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN IEO AND ICO?

IEOs are a byproduct of initial coin offerings (ICOs), which took off in 2016. ICOs are also a way to raise capital, bypassing banks and venture capital firms.

But IEOs take place on cryptocurrency exchanges which, for a fee, effectively act as middlemen, performing functions such as due diligence on a project, “know your customer” screening, marketing and selling tokens to customers.

ICOs, on the other hand, are undertaken by start-ups themselves, shouldering the token offering costs and selling these currencies on their websites. They have raised nearly $29 billion for cryptocurrency companies since 2016, but slowed sharply this year amid a regulatory crackdown on fraudulent and illegal offerings led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The limit on the amount of tokens that can be bought at IEOs - usually capped at $20,000 - has enhanced the attractiveness of these offerings to retail investors and has prevented bigger investors from monopolizing them.

Investors that want to participate in IEOs just go to the exchange’s website.

“An IEO is like Goldman Sachs crashing into Nasdaq,” said Steven Nerayoff, chief executive officer of consulting and investment firm Alchemist, suggesting that exchanges like Nasdaq have taken on investment banking functions, such as vetting IEOs and marketing them to customers.

“It’s a new breed of fundraising that could potentially change what’s happening in finance ... but regulations have to be figured out.”

HOW MUCH HAVE IEOS RAISED SO FAR?

Start-ups doing IEOs, however, are raising millions of dollars quickly, sometimes within seconds, reminiscent of a trend seen at the peak of ICOs in early 2017.

For instance, Veriblock, a blockchain project leveraging bitcoin’s network, raised $7 million in April through an IEO on the Bittrex exchange in 10 seconds.

Blockhain, which underpins bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies, is a digital database with information that can be publicly shared within a large decentralized network.

IEOs have raised $1.5 billion so far this year, according to cryptocurrency tracker CoinSchedule, compared with just $836 million raised from ICOs since January. Crypto exchange operators interviewed by Reuters said hundreds of start-ups are lining up to do IEOs, more than they could possibly handle.

U.S. file-sharing firm BitTorrent, which conducted an IEO on Binance Launchpad, officially kicked IEOs into high gear at Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.

“IEOs are helpful for projects like us because we don’t have the time to do compliance,” said Justin Sun, founder and chief executive officer of TRON, a blockchain-based company focused on building a decentralized internet. TRON purchased BitTorrent for $120 million in 2018.

WHAT DO IEOS MEAN FOR EXCHANGES?

IEOs typically mean more revenues for exchanges. Exchanges that will host an IEO will typically do the vetting process of a project for a fee. They also get fees when the token starts trading on their exchange.

Market observers said IEOs came at a time when cryptocurrency exchanges struggled as digital currencies slumped and cryptocurrency buyers dwindled. IEOs gave them some form of lifeline.

For some exchanges, however, IEOs mean more users for their trading platform and some of them are willing to undertake the screening process of a project even without a listing fee.

By doing IEOs, we attract communities to trade on Beaxy,” said Artak Hamazaspyan, chief executive officer at digital asset exchange Beaxy Digital, which opened its trading platform to IEOs. “If I list a project and it’s not listed anywhere else, I get all these communities to join us.”",2019-06-20 17:55:23+00:00,https://www.information-age.com/facebooks-libra-crypto-mainstream-hackers-paradise-123483445/,"Facebook’s Libra: cryptocurrencies in the mainstream or a hacker’s paradise?

Will Facebook's imminent cryptocurrency, Libra, bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream or leave users open to hackers?

Facebook's Libra will let people buy things or send money instantly with nearly zero fees. Does this signal cryptocurrencies entering the mainstream or will it be a hacker's paradise?

Facebook’s Libra, expected to launch in 2020, is a reserve-backed digital cryptocurrency that people can use to buy things and send money across from their mobile phones. It’s been called a ‘new more inclusive financial ecosystem, powered by blockchain technology’ — and this may be the case. It may be the case that Facebook’s Libra will be the catalyst that propels cryptocurrency into the mainstream. But, it could go the other way. This ‘new, inclusive financial ecosystem,’ could be a hacker’s paradise.

Facebook’s Libra

Facebook is joining the Libra Association, an independent consortium with members such as Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and Coinbase, through a newly established subsidiary, Calibra.

The association will independently govern and oversee Calibra’s bespoke cryptocurrency, Libra—with the digital coin imagined to further a global financial system. This marks the social media giant’s boldest foray into the financial services industry. It will be available in Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and as a standalone app.

Peer-to-peer transactions — Facebook’s Libra will most likely be used for peer-to-peer transactions, “as well as for facilitating e-commerce,” said Jo Howes, commercial director at digital banking software provider CREALOGIX. “This means the tech giant can manage payments internally, rather than having to rely on payments partners as it has done in the past.”

The big names associated with this project is one reason there was so much excitement about the announcement. According to Terry Angelos — SVP, global head of Fintech at Visa, one of the members of the Libra Association — “digital currencies like Libra could provide new pathways out of cash-dependence and accelerate the journey of the estimated 1.7 billion unbanked consumers into the formal financial system — which is why Visa is interested in better understanding the Libra model, and potentially shaping its development.”

Cryptocurrency in the mainstream

Rosie Burbidge, partner at gunnercooke and blockchain specialist, said the news is a sign that use of cryptocurrency is becoming more acceptable and entering the mainstream. While Facebook has a terrific user base and the right tools to make this happen, given Facebook’s recent data protection and privacy issues it is inevitable that regulators, particularly in the EU, will be looking at this development very closely.

“This has been in the pipeline for a while and it fits in with Facebook’s longer term strategy to move into areas like retail and traditional media (in addition to social media). An important feature of Facebook’s Libra currency is that it is pegged to fiat currencies. So while Bitcoin has suffered from massive currency fluctuations, Facebook’s approach should avoid those ups and downs,” said Burbidge.

Others could argue that until Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules are enforced by the cryptomarket, the crypto boom will never reach the heights so many have predicted.

Impact on the cryptocurrency market

Facebook’s plan is to make Libra one of the most well-integrated and user-friendly cryptocurrencies. If it succeeds, this will have a big effect on the cryptocurrency market.

“The level of integration and coordination between Libra and other services is unmatched by any other cryptocurrency at the time of launch,” stated Ana Bencic, president and founder of NextHash. “This is a really exciting development and we predict that Libra will nudge more traditional investors and traders towards a deeper involvement in the cryptocurrency market.”

Again, this might appeal to traditional investors compared to other cryptocurrencies powered by blockchain technology… if they can get over their scepticism of digital currencies — regulation and compliance challenges must be addressed.

A hacker’s paradise

It’s not all plain sailing and some believe Facebook’s Libra will be a hacker’s paradise.

Indeed, Christian Lanng — CEO of European fintech unicorn company Tradeshift — has poured scorn on the plans, voicing his concerns that the launch will further erode trust in the embattled platform.

He said:

“Libra is a distraction from the core challenges which Facebook has with its community of users. Monetising accounts and attention is going to lead to a spike in fraud, further reducing consumer trust in a product that is already at a very low ebb.

“Any notion that assigning a monetary value to attention will somehow help Facebook address its trust issues is missing the point of why those trust issues began with in the first place. You cannot achieve trust simply by sprinkling blockchain over the problem.

“Libra is going to be a scammer and hacker paradise, eroding whatever trust users had left in the Facebook platform. It is literally the opposite of what any real users of the Facebook platform wanted Facebook to focus on.

“The fact this is being compared to WeChat highlights the fundamental difference between WeChat and Facebook. Users trust WeChat.”

In the consumer’s best interest?

Another sceptic, Ray Walsh — digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy.com — suggests Facebook’s Libra might not be in the best interest of consumers, regarding their privacy concerns.

“Facebook’s track record for protecting consumer data is massively troubling, and adding knowledge of consumer transactions to its database is only going to increase the firm’s ability to track consumers and their purchasing habits. Considering that Facebook is already the second largest advertiser in the world (second only to Google) this added integration is concerning,” he said.

“The idea that social data and financial data could be combined is worrying, and although Facebook claims that it will keep the distinct data sets at arm’s length – it is hard to believe that consumer habits will not be tracked in order to allow Facebook to better serve ads. After all, that is how the firm produces the majority of its revenue streams. Facebook has proven, time and time again, that it is not to be trusted with consumer data and it seems unlikely that it does not plan to exploit as much consumer data as it is legally permitted to do so. Facebook’s whitepaper claims that it will not source transaction data from the Libra Blockchain without consumer consent. For the time being, no privacy policies or Terms of Service are available for Libra coin.

“For this reason, we will have to wait and see exactly what permissions users must agree to in order to start using the coin. However, if Facebook’s previous services are anything to go by, it seems likely that consent will be inextricably linked to the service from the get-go giving Facebook users little option but to agree — should they want to take advantage of the ease of use provided by integrated Libra payments across its platforms. This is concerning, considering that Facebook is posturing Libra payments as a way for disenfranchised people in third world countries — including women without bank accounts — to make payments.”

LINE is close to winning a crypto exchange license from the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA), which could issue the approval as early as this month, the news outlet reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

With that regulatory clearance, LINE would be able to launch the platform – called BitMax– in a few weeks to offer cryptocurrency trading services to its 80 million users in Japan, the report added.

In July of 2018, LINE launched a cryptocurrency exchange dubbed BitBox based in Singapore, which excludes users from the firm’s home nation due to lack of regulatory clearance.

As of March this year, only 19 cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan had received a license from the FSA as the agency had tightened up its scrutiny following the $530 million Coincheck hack in January 2018. Coincheck obtained a license from the FSA earlier this year.

Bloomberg further said LINE now has another banking license pending in Japan, which is unlikely to be issued until next year. Under such a banking license, LINE would be able to create a cryptocurrency payments tunnel for other services like online shopping.

In March, the FSA granted a license to cryptocurrency exchange Rakuten Wallet, which was rebranded from a bitcoin exchange called Everybody’s Bitcoin Inc that was acquired by Japan’s e-commerce giant Rakuten in 2018.

The new tool allow users to take a closer look at the cryptocurrency transactions they make, providing “independent, substantive evidence of the ‘private key and public address pairing'” to establish ownership of cryptocurrency and gather information about blockchain transactions and balances, according to the company.

PwC is now using the product in auditing those clients that transact in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, litecoin, ethereum, OAX and XRP. The tool is additionally being offered to firms that don’t have a direct relationship with PwC, “helping them to implement the processes and controls they will require in order to obtain assurance reports from their auditors,” PwC’s press release states.

“It is important as companies continue to digitize we, as auditors, keep up with technology changes in the market, continue to develop audit tools that meet the needs of emerging technologies and serve the changing and developing demands of our stakeholders,” James Chalmers, PwC’s global assurance leader, said a statement.

As previously reported, PwC has been working as an auditor with Tezos Foundation and the Hong Kong stablecoin project Loorping Foundation.

In addition to auditing blockchain companies, PwC did some crypto investigation itself and reported in March about finding out that two Iranians under the U.S. sanctions have been using the Russia-originated crypto exchange WEX, the successor of the now defunct BTC-e, allegedly to launder money.

Some of the firm’s employees have shifted into roles in the blockchain industry itself as well. Roman Schnider, co-creator of PwC Switzerland’s blockchain initiative, left the “Big Four” firm to become Tezos’ CFO in June. Earlier this year, PwC’s blockchain principal Grainne McNamara left to join auditing firm EY, which also does work in the space.

It has been another fruitful Friday in crypto land. Markets have hit a new high for the year and as usual it is Bitcoin driving them. A total market cap top of $300 billion was touched a few hours ago as BTC broke through resistance once again surging to a new 13 month high.

The move came a few hours ago during early Asian trading. This time it wasn’t a ‘Bart type spike’ but a gradual grind up through the resistance at $9,600 and on towards an intraday high of $9,800. Since then gains have mostly held as Bitcoin remained around $9,700 with plenty of talk about a further move to $10k today or over the weekend.

Ethereum also got a boost this time as a 4 percent climb lifted it to $280. In comparison however ETH is still way down, over 80 percent of ATH compared to BTC which is now close to 50 percent. There is no doubt that Ethereum will crack $300 and make bigger gains when altseason kicks in but at the moment the going is slow.

Altcoin Outlook

The crypto top ten has not reacted with the usual fervor and aside from Binance Coin adding 6 percent nothing else has really moved much. There is a little green with Bitcoin Cash and EOS adding 2 percent each but others such as BSV are falling back. There has been no movement on XRP, LTC and XLM.

The top twenty is equally lethargic aside from Monero which is still climbing with a further 6 percent today to reach $108. The Bitfinex transparency initiative UNUS SED LEO has arrived on the scene as CMC has just registered a market cap of $1.8 billion jumping it straight into 14th place above Dash. LEO tokens were trading at $1.84 at the time of writing. The rest of the altcoins are up a percent or flat at the moment.

Total crypto market capitalization surged almost $15 billion to top out at a new 2019 high of $300 billion a few hours ago. A slight correction has dropped markets back to $297 billion at the moment but things are still bullish. Bitcoin is the only thing driving market gains at the moment as dominance increases to 58 percent in its push to five figures.

Building Wealth Through Crypto

Emilie Jerard is a cryptocurrency enthusiast, advocate, and expert. She provides advice on building wealth through “crypto” on her website, her YouTube channel, and her podcast, Crypto Talk.

Jerard, whose day job is working for Newark, New Jersey’s Medical Examiner’s Officer and Columbia University—she prepares human tissue for pathology analysis and has degrees in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology— is excited about the prospects of Libra and explains why you should be too.

“It’s wonderful,” she says about the Libra announcement. “Crypto is something that needs a platform—international. Now it’s tied to a company that everyone knows about. [Facebook] has a huge user base (Facebook has about 2.38 billion monthly active users as of March 31, 2019).

“Facebook is a big, big player. They are definitely going to change the conversation,” on crypto, Jerard says.

Others in the crypto space agree. According to Nigel Green, the founder and CEO of deVere Group, one of the world’s largest independent financial advisory organizations, Facebook’s entry into cryptocurrency is “another nail in the coffin for traditional banks.”

“Facebook’s launch into cryptocurrencies tells us two things. First, the role of traditional banks will decline at a quicker rate than many had previously predicted. Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency will be able to transact across traditional payment rails. They have partnered with PayPal, Mastercard, Visa, and Stripe, amongst others to fuel merchant acceptance of the digital currency,” said Green via a released statement.

“If you have cryptocurrency on these payment methods, the purpose of and use for traditional banks will surely shrink.

[RELATED: THREE BLACK CRYPTOCURRENCY INFLUENCERS TO FOLLOW]

“Cryptocurrencies and fintech [financial technology] solutions are already taking business away from banks. They are filling a gap left by the traditional way of doing things as the world speeds up and becomes increasingly globalized and digitalized.”

Green says that Facebook’s presence in the space is significant. “Tech giants entering the cryptocurrency sector indicates that digital money, as a concept, is fully mainstream and inevitably the way the world is going.”

A ‘Game Changer’ in Crypto

Libra will likely be used to make purchases via Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp—all owned by Facebook.

There is another game-changing use for it, says Jerard. People worldwide will have the ability to send and receive money to and from anyone.

“I can send people money, U.S. dollars,” she explains. “What is considered ‘fiat.’ Fiat is any money backed by a government; the U.S. dollar, the pound. I can send a Libra coin to someone and then they would take that and convert it into whatever money for their particular country.”

Jerard is concerned about the lack of diversity in the crypto space and the lack of awareness about it among black people.

“All black people should have some type of cryptocurrency,” she advises. “It’s all about getting into this now before it becomes too restrictive.”

She offers several tips for black people to get into cryptocurrency, and perhaps Libra when it becomes available and answers several FAQs:

When is Libra going to be available?

According to Jerard, Facebook announced availability within 6-12 months. However, that may be delayed as the new currency undergoes anticipated scrutiny from European and U.S. financial regulators.

However, Jerard thinks Facebook will prevail against any pushback. “They are very powerful. They have a lot of money, they have a lot of lobbyists,” she says.

How much should you buy when Libra becomes available?

“As soon as it comes out, buy whatever your budget will allow you to buy. As it increases in value, convert it to whatever your fiat is. The rate of return against whatever the government [sets] is so huge,” she says.

“With crypto, we’re talking about percentages of 200%, 1,000% and that’s the type of rate of return I’m looking for. This is a better use of my money. But I don’t gamble with it. I’m a long-term investor, a “HODLr,” which is ‘Holding On for Dear Life.’

I look at cryptocurrency as a 10-15 year strategy. I have a portfolio of ones that are really good. They have a good use case, they have good developers, the backing behind them is very solid.”

Jerard says it’s important to research the company behind any cryptocurrency you may be considering investing in.

What about security concerns with Facebook’s platform?

“There are definitely security concerns, “ says Jerard. “What I tell everybody; whenever you buy cryptocurrency have your own wallet that only you have the private key for.”

Digital coins are stored in what is known as digital wallets. These wallets can be online, apps, or actual encrypted USB drives.

She says the best digital wallets are not online though or stored on anyone’s platform. “Put your cryptocurrency in your wallet.”

Jerard has made it her mission to educate people about crypto. She often gives tutorials in churches and at different functions.

“I want to make [the crypto space] accessible,” she explains. “It’s great. It’s very democratic. And I believe that it’s the future.”

The price hopped the $10K barrier at 7:35pm Eastern Time.

At press time, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading at $$10,080.49 – the highest level since March 8, 2018 – representing month-to-date gains in excess of 13 percent, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. On a 24-hour basis, BTC is outshining most top 10 cryptocurrencies with 7 percent gains.

The price rise is backed by a 12 percent jump in trading volumes. As per data source CoinMarketCap, $21 billion worth of bitcoins have traded across cryptocurrency exchanges in the last 24 hours. Messari, however, is reporting the “Real 10” volume at $1.4 billion.

With the move above $10,000, bitcoin has erased more than 40 percent of the sell-off seen in twelve months to December 2018. Further, prices look set to end the second quarter with triple-digit gains. As of writing, BTC is up more than 130 percent on a quarter-to-date basis.

Halving on the horizon

Looking forward, BTC may continue to shine bright as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo mining reward halving sometime in May 2020.

The process designed to curb inflation by reducing the reward for mining on bitcoin’s blockchain is repeated every four years and leads to supply deficit.

The upcoming reward halving may leave a bigger supply deficit if Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra ends up boosting bitcoin’s appeal and adoption rate as predicted by some observers.

On Tuesday, the social media giant launched the white paper to mixed reviews with pundits it a net positive development for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.

While bitcoin’s long-term prospects look bright, the cryptocurrency may see a pullback in the short-term. After all, prices have rallied more than 140 percent in the last 2.5-months and bulls usually take a breather following such stellar gains.

In the interview, Garlinghouse outlined the key difference of two major cryptocurrencies, arguing that bitcoin is a store of value or “digital gold,” while XRP is a “bridge currency” that enables an efficient solution for fiat-to-fiat transfers.

As such, Garlinghouse cited the difference between bitcoin and XRP in terms of transactions costs, claiming that Ripple can do a transaction for a tiny fraction of a cent while a bitcoin transactions costs roughly $2.30 on average.

However, such a difference “does not mean that bitcoin is gonna fail or something,” Ripple CEO noted, stating that he “[does] not view them as competitive.

Garlinghouse expressed confidence that there will not be one single cryptocurrency to “rule them all,” implying that each cryptocurrency should prove a certain use case.

Garlinghouse stated:

""I own bitcoin, I'm long bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is a store of value and people hold it.""

In the interview, CEO of Ripple also expressed his stance towards the current environment on crypto markets, pointing out that there is “a lot of bullshit in blockchain and crypto market,” and it is often hard for the industry to separate the signal from the “noise.”

In this regard, Garlinghouse spoke of the media overhype around Facebook’s recently officially unveiled cryptocurrency libra, which is expected for launch in the first half of 2020. Specifically, the Ripple exec cited a title of a recent article on CNBC “Facebook Launches Cryptocurrency,” arguing that Facebook has actually not launched any cryptocurrency so far, but just announced their intent to do so in a year from now. Previously, Garlinghouse considered that a cryptocurrency project by American banking giant JPMorgan Chase “misses the point.”

If you own any cryptocurrency, the chances are you’ve had to use an address, or a wallet, or both. It’s confusing, right? Well, it doesn’t have to be.

The fact of the matter is that a wallet and an address are not the same thing, but the differences are relatively easy to understand.

With this in mind, we’ll define what they each are and explain the differences without the unnecessary technical detail.

An address

When it comes to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, an address is made up of random letters and numbers.

A Bitcoin address, for example, is usually made up of 26-35 alphanumeric characters and typically begin with the number 1, 3, or bc1.

All addresses represent a destination on the Bitcoin network. What you really need to know is that, unlike addresses in the real-world, Bitcoin addresses are only meant to be used once.

Basically, the idea is that for each Bitcoin transaction, users will generate a unique, single-use address to provide to senders.

Hard Fork has previously explained what they are and how they work in a bit more detail here.

A wallet

A wallet comes with an address by default, which is why things can get confusing at times.

But, although a wallet comes with an address, it’s important to remember that it’s not the same as an address.

A cryptocurrency wallet can consist of a string of different addresses. The fact that it’s called a wallet can be a little misleading because it doesn’t actually hold all your credit cards in the say way that Apple Pay does, for example.

Instead, a cryptocurrency wallet is more similar to a key ring because it holds a copy of each private key and its corresponding address. If it’s a good wallet, it should also automatically generate fresh Bitcoin addresses with every transaction.

So regardless of whether you own just Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or a host of several different cryptocurrencies, all you need to do is open your wallet to gain access to all the different addresses contained within it.

As you might expect, there are different ways you can access your cryptocurrency wallet: on a desktop, on a browser, or by using a physical wallet. Otherwise known as “cold storage,” physical wallets are more secure because they’re offline and less susceptible to hacks.

The latest report from Ernst & Young, which is overseeing the bankruptcy process for Quadriga Fintech Solutions Corp., paints a clearer picture of a Vancouver-based firm that lacked financial reporting and operational controls, run primarily by a founder whose actions ultimately led to its collapse, leaving hundreds of customers owed millions in cash and cryptocurrency.

“Quadriga’s operating infrastructure appears to have been significantly flawed from a financial reporting and operational control perspective,” the June 19 report said. “Activities were largely directed by a single individual, Mr. Cotten, and as a result typical segregation of duties and basic internal controls did not appear to exist.”

Cotten ran Quadriga mostly from his laptop, and his sudden death in December while traveling in India threw the business into disarray. Speculation has swirled around the firm as a series of peculiar details have filtered out, including that digital storage accounts used by Quadriga to hold Bitcoin for clients were empty for months before Cotten’s death.

There were “significant volumes” of cryptocurrency transferred off the Quadriga platform into competitor exchanges and into personal accounts controlled by Cotten, the report said.

“It appears that user cryptocurrency was traded on these exchanges and in some circumstances used as a security for a margin trading account established by Cotten,” according to the report.

Competitor exchanges received multiple forms of cryptocurrencies from Quadriga wallets from 2016 through 2019 — 9,450 Bitcoin, 387,738 Ethereum and 239,020 Litecoin, according to the report. Quadriga’s cryptocurrency reserves were “adversely affected” by trading losses and incremental fees charged by other exchanges, the report said.

“The conversion of user cryptocurrency into other currencies through competitor exchanges resulted in incremental fees being incurred and currency exchange fluctuations relative to the original currency generating gains and losses,” the report said. “In addition, it appears that the activity in the exchange accounts resulted in overall trading losses.”

The late CEO also created accounts under aliases where “unsupported deposits” were used to trade within the platform, resulting in inflated revenue figures, artificial trades with users and ultimately the withdrawal of cryptocurrency, the report said. And “substantial funds” were transferred to Cotten personally and other related parties.

Ernst & Young said it learned from one exchange that Cotten established a margin account and traded various cryptocurrencies “extensively” — 67,000 individual transactions — with multiple digital assets that didn’t trade on Quadriga. That account was subject to substantial fees and generated substantial losses.

Cotten also used an offshore exchange, of which 21,501 Bitcoin were deposited into an account in Cotten’s name. Ernst & Young’s investigation suggests that at least some of that Bitcoin came from Quadriga, though it’s unclear exactly how much. The report said it appears Cotten liquidated all but 8 Bitcoin from that account over the course of three years, for the equivalent of C$80 million ($60.6 million).

Ernst & Young also updated the amount owed to QuadrigaCX users, to C$74.1 million in cash and C$140.5 million in cryptocurrency. Court filings from January initially estimated account holders had C$70 million in cash balances and C$190 million in cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency investors in India are wondering whether it’s the end of the road for them.

An inter-ministerial panel, tasked with drafting regulations for the sector, has reportedly recommended a complete ban on the sale, purchase, and issuance of cryptocurrencies in India, likening it to a ponzi scheme.

The committee, formed in November 2017, is headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary of India’s department of economic affairs.

A report (paywall) earlier this month, had said the panel had also recommended that mining, holding, and disposing virtual currencies should be made illegal, besides suggesting a jail term of ten years for anyone transacting in such coins, subject to certain clauses, which are still not known.

But will these recommendations become law, and, if so, how can investors ring-fence their digital coin investments?

Ban or no ban?

The Garg panel’s recommendations notwithstanding, some crypto investors still see the glass as half full.

The most important reason for the optimism is Facebook’s plans to launch its own crypto token, Libra, next year, which may make an outright ban difficult. “The panel report held weight before Facebook announced its plans. The tech giant launching a similar currency provides some sense of legitimacy,” said Nischal Shetty, CEO of WaxirX, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange.

“If Facebook is going to come up with this, then other tech companies may follow suit. It is hard to believe the government will say that such big companies are also into a ponzi scheme.”

However, some are not convinced.

“Did anyone ever think that demonetisation may happen,” quipped another industry expert, requesting anonymity. “It is anyone’s guess what the next step might be.”

Before the Garg panel, a committee was set up in April 2017 to look into regulating cryptocurrencies. It is believed that it, too, had submitted an adverse report to the government in July that year. Yet, a ban was never implemented. Now that the second panel has also not supported cryptocurrencies, a ban maybe finally likely, some believe.

Then, there are also reports suggesting Facebook may not launch Libra in India due to an unfavourable government stance.

Given the mixed signals, chaos currently reigns in the Indian crypto ecosystem. While some want to hold on to their digital currency assets, others are not sure. What is certain, though, is that it is definitely not the time to buy.

So, what should you do if you already hold bitcoins?

The game plan

The answer is not exactly straightforward, believe experts. It depends on the price you bought, risk appetite, amount invested, and how sophisticated an investor you are.

“A lay investor, who doesn’t know much about cryptocurrencies, but just ended up investing, may look at exiting soon at an opportune time,” said a member of the cryptocurrency industry, under the condition of anonymity.

Some others echo this view.

“A lay retail investor with a significant amount of his net worth in crypto, should slowly start cashing out in case something actually happens and they’re not able to get any money out,” said a cryptocurrency enthusiast who identifies himself by the pseudonym Gabru and runs groups with over 4,000 members on the instant messaging platform Telegram.

The catch, however, is that prices have crashed in the Indian market and trading volumes have been low making selling a tad difficult, added the blockchain consultant. Therefore, one may need to time it carefully to sell it and will have to wait and watch till then.

Other options

More seasoned investors, though concerned about the future of cryptocurrencies in India, are still not worried about their investments.

There are adept investors who have started devising ways to skirt a possible ban. “There are some who have already started pushing their crypto holdings, or the funds after liquidating it, to members who are abroad under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS),” said a blockchain consultant, requesting anonymity. Under, LRS, Indian residents are allowed to remit up to $250,000 (Rs1.74 crore) in one financial year.

“Savvy investors don’t have anything to worry about. Everyone knows that crypto is a global phenomenon and no country can stop it single-handedly. People would sell for cash or send their crypto abroad and get the money transferred here,” added Gabru.

Moreover, reports have suggested that even if a ban comes into effect individuals may be given a time period of up to three months to dispose off their assets. These investors are also taking heart in the fact that these are still recommendations and it may still take time for it to become a law.

However, there is always a chance that it may become a law sooner. “The process of a bill becoming a law may be expedited if it is passed as a money bill or is introduced as an ordinance,” said Jaideep Reddy, a senior member of the international law firm Nishith Desai Associates. “Or if the government uses its executive power such as a notification under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act even then some new provisions can come into force earlier, although they will be restricted by the scope of the parent statute.”

Yet, well-versed investors are prepared even for that.

“Even in such a dire situation there is going to be a way out. You can trade on peer-to-peer platforms and get paid in multiple bank accounts to avoid suspicion,” said another investor who has been dealing with cryptocurrencies for the last few years.

The anonymity may provide a way out but it may not be that easy. Now, all eyes are on the government’s next move.",,https://www.coindesk.com/japan-watchdog-orders-improvements-after-fisco-crypto-exchange-violations,"Cryptocurrency exchange owner Fisco is being forced to improve its business management systems after an investigation by the country’s financial watchdog.

According to a release from the Financial Services Agency (FSA), on Feb. 13, the agency visited Fisco – a Japanese investment firm that took over ownership of the hacked Zaif exchange in April and found that the firm had made a number of “legal violations.”

The FSA said it found “problems” with the firm’s business management – for example, the board of directors had not been discussing “important management issues such as business plans.” Risk management at Fisco, relating to potential issues like money laundering and financing of terrorism, was also found to be lacking, as did other aspects of general business management, such as its outsourcing process.

The FSA said “management did not recognize the importance of legal compliance.”

To bring the company back in line with its expectations, the agency has handed Fisco a business improvement order, mandating it to establish a system to allow proper internal management, outsourcing, accounting and auditing. The firm must also set up risk management systems for fiat and cryptocurrency.

In its September 2018 hack, Zaif lost approximately 7 billion yen ($62.5 million) in bitcoin (BTC), monacoin (MONA) and bitcoin cash (BCH).

A month later, Fisco announced its intention to take over the ailing firm and finally completed the acquisition in April, at which point normal services were resumed for the first time since the hack.

The FSA was said to also be investigating Huobi Japan alongside Fisco, according to a Reuters report in April. No public statement has so far been made by the agency on any conclusions, however.

They also show that the foundation’s enviable fundraising prowess survived a workplace-bullying scandal that led to the resignation last year of its top fundraiser, Mari Ellen Loijens, and its longtime president and chief executive, Emmett Carson.

The foundation managed to attract $1.9 billion in contributions in 2018, up from $1.4 billion the previous year.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a big-time supporter, donated an additional 1.4 million Facebook shares worth $214 million on Nov. 8, according to a public filing. That was the same day the foundation named Nicole Taylor as its new president and CEO.

Taylor said the foundation “probably lost a couple” of major donors last year, but she was happy to see contributions rise despite the turmoil. The foundation’s interim CEO, Greg Avis, and its board “did a lot to reach out to donors,” and the staff kept things “moving and stabilized,” Taylor said.

The Mountain View foundation was formed in 2006 by the merger of community foundations serving the Peninsula and Silicon Valley. It grew into a behemoth, mainly by opening donor-advised funds for wealthy tech executives. A donor-advised fund is a separate account held at a public charity, such as the foundation, or nonprofits set up by investment firms like Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Vanguard.

Donors get a tax deduction when they contribute cash or appreciated assets such as stock, real estate or cryptocurrency to their account. The gift is irrevocable, but the donor can usually decide how the money is invested, which charities get grants and when. The donor doesn’t have to disburse any minimum amount each year, the way private foundations do. Nor do they have to disclose their investments; private foundations must disclose them in great detail.

The foundation has been criticized for having such a large portion of its assets, 86%, in donor-advised funds. Community foundations are generally established to serve local needs, but about 65% of the grants coming from the Silicon Valley foundation in 2017 went to national and international charities.

Taylor, a former top administrator with Arizona State University, Stanford University and the East Bay Community Foundation, wants to encourage more local giving. “My goal is to put the community back in the community foundation,” she said. Some donors see their Bay Area employees struggling and are redirecting their grants closer to home, she added.

The foundation handed out $1.9 billion in grants last year, up from $1.8 billion in 2017. In both years, about a third of those amounts went not to operating charities but to donor-advised funds at other providers.

Taylor said another goal is for the foundation to become more transparent about everything, including its investments. Until now, it had disclosed virtually nothing about its cryptocurrency.

For example, in February 2018 it said in a news release that its assets had reached about $13.5 billion by the end of 2017, an astonishing 65% increase of $5.3 billion from the previous year. That made it the nation’s second largest foundation, ranked by assets, behind the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Almost all of that growth came from its investment portfolio. But no asset class, other than cryptocurrency, had those kinds of gains in 2017. The press release gave no explanation for that meteoric growth; when I asked former CEO Carson about it for a column, he declined to comment.

When the foundation released its audited financial statements for 2017 last summer, it disclosed, in the most cryptic way possible, that it held $4.5 billion — nearly one-third of its assets — in one category of “real assets” that accounting experts said must have been digital assets.

“They were not even up-front about the fact that it was a cryptocurrency, much less a single cryptocurrency that was sales-restricted,” said Brian Mittendorf, an Ohio State University accounting professor. “It is baffling to me that such a huge risk to the organization’s holdings would not be more transparently disclosed.”

This year’s statement provides far more information. It said that the majority of its digital assets are in one cryptocurrency and “subject to sales restrictions related to timing and volume.” Those restrictions have prevented the foundation from selling more than a small portion of its crypto assets each year.

The foundation didn’t name the currency but it’s believed to be XRP. Ripple Labs of San Francisco owns a significant stake in XRP and uses it in its payment system.

Chris Larsen, who co-founded Ripple, has been contributing XRP to a donor-advised fund at the Silicon Valley foundation since 2013. Jed McCaleb, another co-founder who is no longer with Ripple, settled a lawsuit in 2016 by agreeing not to sell more than a certain amount of XRP each year and to donate 2 billion XRP to “a charitable donor-advised fund of his choice.”

“The same limits are placed on the ability of the charity to sell the XRP as are placed on Jed’s ability to sell his remaining XRP,” Ripple said in a forum post.

Larsen, Ripple’s executive chairman, said that charity was the Silicon Valley foundation. McCaleb didn’t return a request for comment.

Other charities also accept cryptocurrency contributions, “but most convert them into fiat (i.e. dollars) as soon as possible,” said Sean Stein Smith, an accounting professor at the City University of New York.

The vast majority of the foundation’s nearly 2.6 billion in cryptocurrency units were donated before 2017, most likely at the end of 2016. The price of XRP and other cryptocurrency soared in 2017, reaching a peak around December, then plummeted in 2018 before recovering somewhat this year.

As a result, the market value of the foundation’s cryptocurrency swelled from about $11 million at the beginning of 2017 to $4.46 billion at the end of that year, then fell to $815 million at the end of 2018 — even though the number of units it held did not change much.

Had the foundation been able and prescient enough to unload its crypto at the peak of the market, it could be more than $3 billion richer right now. “A lot of people wish they had sold their holdings at the end of 2017,” quipped Smith.

The foundation also changed the way it accounts for digital assets last year. This sounds geeky, but it’s a big issue in accounting circles and will only grow larger as companies such as Facebook, JPMorgan Chase and Fidelity are “diving into the cryptocurrency pool,” Smith said.

Before 2018, the foundation treated crypto assets as an investment and recorded them at market value. Starting last year, it treats them as “indefinite-lived intangible assets” and records them “at cost,” or the estimated market value on the day they were donated.

Taylor said some of the nation’s top accounting firms recommended that entities other than investment firms account for digital currency this way.

Larsen, who once worked as an auditor for Chevron, called this method “overly conservative” and “ridiculous.” He said crypto markets have become so “deep and liquid” that digital currencies should be treated like other investments and recorded at their market value.

The foundation restated its 2017 financial statement to reflect the accounting change. So instead of ending 2017 with $13.58 billion in total assets (as touted in that press release) it now shows it ending the year with $9.15 billion. Its assets at the end of 2018 were $8.9 billion.

The truth is that nobody knows how to account for cryptocurrency, which is unlike any other currency or asset. The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which establishes accounting rules for U.S. companies and nonprofits, has issued no rules on the practice.

The foundation’s startling disclosures about its crypto holdings “highlight the need for increased guidance and clarity as to how these assets are treated and disclosed to investors, donors and any other parties,” Smith said.

Whether you’re a Store of Value advocate or a Medium of Exchange purveyor, every bitcoiner ought to spend a little crypto from time to time. Consider it as paying it forward, spreading the love, fostering adoption or simply treating yourself. And where better to send your spare satoshis than the darknet, where a man or woman can obtain anything they like for a price.

The State of Darknet Markets Today

Despite 2019 proving a bumper year for law enforcement on the darknet, there are actually more darknet markets (DNMs) today than there were in January. Dream has closed and Wall Street exit scammed/been busted, but as a glance at DNM listing site dark.fail shows, it’s still business as usual. And right now, business is good, with buyers offered more stores than ever stocked with a cornucopia of wares, and a plethora of cryptocurrencies they can use, from bitcoin cash to monero.

Before we round up the current crop of darknet markets, and examine the sort of goods they’re shipping, let’s take a moment to consider the intersection of cryptocurrency and crime. To date, there have been some incongruous attempts at deploying cryptographic technology for the purposes of crime prevention.

On the one hand, we have projects like Intelli Network, a P2P application for anonymously sharing crime tips. And then we have the onion site operated by The Northern California Illicit Digital Economy (NCIDE) Task Force. It contains a list of arrested DNM vendors, plus other DNM dealers located in northern California who have been identified. In centuries past, executed criminals would have their remains hung from the city gates as a warning to other miscreants. NCIDE’s onion site the modern day counterpart; a digital warning to be safe when using the darknet, and avoid getting rekt like these unfortunate souls.

Empire Market

The trouble with visiting darknet markets for review purposes, is that you chance across fractions of a bitcoin you still have stored in them – fractions that are worth more than the last time you logged in, tempting a man to order some goodies. I’m not saying that happened upon reacquainting myself with the darknet’s most popular marketplace of the moment; I’m just heavily implying that it did. Empire accepts BTC and XMR and has an enviable list of products, mostly drugs.

Tochka

Tochka is now one of the oldest DNMs, given that the previous holders of this flame have bitten the dust. The site accepts BTC, BCH, and ETH and is stocked with a wealth of tantalizing wares, whatever your poison. A wide range of countries is serviced, and the site promotes dead drops, for customers who’d rather collect their goods from a discrete public location.

Berlusconi Market

Another well established DNM, Berlusconi can hook you up with pretty much anything you care for aside from weapons and explosives – they’re being delisted on July 17. BTC, LTC, and XMR are supported on the site, which lists over 33,000 products for Drugs & Chemicals alone, but it also lists software, tutorials, jewels, and gold.

Cryptonia

Cryptonia is a wallet-less multisig DNM, which removes the risk of having to deposit funds into your account and hope that the site isn’t shut down before you’ve had a chance to spend them. BTC and XMR are the cryptocurrencies accepted here. With only around 1,300 listings for weed and hashish, and less for other categories of drugs, Cryptonia lacks the traction of the darknet market leaders.

Dream Alt

Another new DNM which supposedly has no connection to Dream, Dream Alt is a BTC-only marketplace that’s stocked with the usual substances. It’s around the same size as Cryptonia at the moment, and it will naturally take time and trust for Dream Alt to grow. Given the rumors that law enforcement have discovered Tor vulns that make any DNM susceptible to takeover, vendors and customers seem to be hedging their bets by signing up for multiple marketplaces. Dream Alt is another candidate for inclusion in any such strategy.

Nightmare

Nightmare earns the award for multicoin friendliness; no less than six cryptos can be spent here. In addition to BTC and BCH, shoppers can use DASH, LTC, XMR, and ZEC. Nightmare is stocked to the gunnels with products too, including 46,000 entries for drugs alone. It’s also got a busy erotica section. The site’s vendor rating system is particularly user friendly, making it easy to discern who’s reputable and who’s not.

Genesis

The darknet’s newest marketplace has an anarchist slant and a desire to “keep buyers and vendors safe from the bad sides that can be encountered on the deepweb.” The BTC-only site is yet another wallet-less DNM, recognizing that this is one of the most effective ways of building trust from day one. The range of categories and subcategories to be found on Genesis is impressive, but as is to be expected, the number of products listed is low at this time.

In addition to the sites profiled above, dark.fail and onion forum Dread list a host of others. Despite sporadic DDoSings and the constant threat of LE enforcement, the concept of darknet markets has proven to be extremely resilient. Sites come and go, but the dream of P2P trading through the pseudonymity granted by cryptocurrency remains very much alive.

Staking is money you don’t want to miss out on — simple as that, right?

While most cryptos today are trading 70 -90 percent below their all-time highs, staking is making what looks like easy money, scoring coin holders up to 30 percent rewards. More and more people are paying attention, with staking touted as the best way to make semi-passive returns in a bear market.

Coinbase is launching staking support, and new staking coins are cropping up to compete with the established players like Tezos, Dash and Decred.

It’s not really that simple. Staking is getting attention for all the wrong reasons, and it’s time to re-examine its role.

Misconceptions around how it works and why it exists will have lasting consequences if expectations aren’t set now. Projects that implement any form of proof-of-stake (PoS) need to plan for long-term sustainability, not just the immediate future.

If You’re Going to Stake, Stake Right

Staking is evolving from being a semi-passive reward, to becoming a powerful incentive for participating in governance. Projects that plan for the future will figure out how to incentivize active participation, while those who elect a set of governors based on the quality of their kickbacks won’t last.

Choosing to stake on the right projects for the right reasons is the best way to earn rewards.

Proof-of-Work (PoW) was introduced on bitcoin as a block validation method to timestamp transactions without the need for a trusted third party. PoW has an established track record with bitcoin securing its network using energy. People began exploring PoS as a way to use less energy to do validation “work.”

PoS is more accessible and decentralized, empowering coin holders, who “stake” coins to “forge” blocks by maintaining an online wallet or node.

Staking started as just another method for recording transactions securely, but it’s constantly evolving. Some implementations are a hybrid with PoW, while others add delegates who either receive votes from, or are empowered to act on behalf of, the group.

Staking for Rewards vs. Staking for Participation

As Zaki Manian, co-creator of Cosmos, pointed out in an interview with CoinDesk, “[P]art of the dynamics of proof-of-stake is how frequently do people just vote to give themselves more money?”

In this scenario, coin holders collect exorbitant rewards without putting in any work.

Staking has been erroneously portrayed as the crypto version of a bond. While there are projects that don’t require any more work than staking funds for a reward, this approach is ultimately unsustainable and will get participants who thought they could “park and earn” into trouble.

It’s not unusual for projects to employ a toothless charade for centralized parties to claim they’re not in control. These systems are often overly complicated and characterized by confusing procedures and non-binding voting, which in practice discourage voter participation and lead to voter apathy.

When it comes to participation, several staking projects have voting on treasury spending — projects like Dash, Decred and PIVX are paving the way in governance where the community participates in project-level decision making. Decred’s participatory voting feature, for example, allows token holders to vote on everything from protocol decisions to choosing to hire its PR firm.

Today, staking spans a gamut of implementations beyond locking up funds, from ensuring the security of a blockchain to changes in consensus rules. PoS doesn’t necessarily imply governance, but its incentive structure combined with governance has radical implications for participation.

Staking for Rewards and Power

With the right incentives, staking can not only return rewards, but also give you input on a project’s future direction. When staking your coins, they usually go through a lock-up period while voting — rules on this vary from project to project.

After voting, you get your coins back as well as a staking reward.

If you vote against the project’s interests, while you’ll still get the immediate staking reward, over time you’ll feel the negative market effects of bad decisions like an all-expenses-paid stakeholder’s ski trip to Switzerland. In a system that gamifies decision-making and other processes, voting on decisions has a longer-lasting effect beyond earning an immediate staking reward.

Staking governance is powerful because it embodies a philosophical underpinning of the crypto movement: the belief humanity’s accepted forms of large-scale decision-making aren’t working well.

Staking aims to put that into practice — in crypto in the near term and on a societal scale in the distant future. This means eliminating corrupt intermediaries in favor of peer-to-peer interaction, and shirking representative democracy in favor of direct voting.

Individual sovereignty is tantamount; if you have skin in the game (i.e. are financially invested), you should help determine the direction of that game. But with that comes the responsibility of making informed decisions, and not necessarily trusting anyone else is going to make them for you. If you want to participate in staking long-term, you need to understand a project well enough to stake it.

If you want to have a say in how a project is run, you need to stake one that incorporates your sovereignty as a user. To participate, you need to keep up on changes to its consensus rules and actively vote for what you believe is best for it.

Staking can yield significant rewards, but to simply receive compensation for voting sets up a poor alignment structure. Coin holders must understand the responsibility that comes with locking up their coins and use it wisely — and only then enjoy the fruits of their labor.

According to the multinational professional services network, its Halo auditing suite has now been updated to accommodate “entities engaging in cryptocurrency transactions.” The new tool reportedly allows PwC to establish crypto asset ownership and gather information about transactions and balances from blockchains.

While it is currently unclear whether Halo will now be picked up by cryptocurrency-related businesses, PwC’s move seems to mark another landmark step for the industry.

Specifics of auditing in the crypto space

Auditing in the crypto space is still a developing practice that varies substantially between stakeholders, as Maurizio Raffone, founder and CEO of Finetiq, told Cointelegraph. He also drew a parallel between on-chain and off-chain audits, explaining:

“On one side, crypto exchanges have historically focused on cyber-security measures, processes and procedures dealing with corporate governance and so forth, just like most other businesses. There are then on-chain audits that tend to focus on checking for bugs and correct workflow of a blockchain protocol or, more often, smart contracts.”

Indeed, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) — a global body for professional accountants — believes that “robust and consistent” accounting treatment is required for different types of cryptocurrencies, as Narayanan Vaidyanathan, head of business insights at ACCA, told Cointelegraph via email:

“This is currently an on-going challenge that is still under deliberation within the accountancy profession. Is a crypto currency cash, inventory, a financial asset, or an intangible asset? Because if there are accounting issues, it therefore as a downstream implication also becomes an audit issue.”

Auditing services might also depend on how companies utilize cryptocurrencies, adds David Martin, chief investment officer at Blockforce Capital:

“It is important to differentiate how a firm is using digital assets in its business dealings. For instance, a company that uses cryptocurrency as a way to make transactions requires different services than an investment firm that is holding digital assets as a form of investment.”

Perhaps the most notable example here would be Tether, the company behind the eponymous stablecoin (USDT) and a wholly owned subsidiary of iFinex — which also owns crypto exchange Bitfinex.

Related: Tether, Bitfinex Stay Afloat Amid Controversy

In early 2018, Tether’s plans to release a third-party audit fell through, although the company had previously announced that it was undergoing a “balance sheet audit” by Friedman LLP, a New York-based accounting firm.

However, in late June 2018, a document was finally produced — although it turned out to be a memorandum rather than an audit performed by an auditing company. As Tether’s general counsel explained at the time, mainstream accounting firms would not conduct official audits on companies working with cryptocurrencies.

While it is unclear whether Tether was willing to provide all the required information to third-party auditors (which could be the reason it could not complete the inspection), the general problem seems to persist within the crypto industry. Ben Tsai, president and managing partner of Wave Financial, told Cointelegraph:

“Cryptocurrency companies definitely have an audit problem. Major players such as exchanges, stablecoins and hedge funds are not consistently providing proof of solvency despite the fact they need to.”

According to experts, the regulatory uncertainty within the space might be part of the issue. As Tsai told Cointelegraph, the current regulatory climate allows crypto businesses to turn to auditing firm only in case of emergency:

“Regulation does not currently require ‘proof of funds’ for stablecoins and for exchanges, which is the main reason these audits aren’t taking place. Mostly, the big four come in and audit companies after they ‘mess up.’”

Indeed, as Martin opines, cryptocurrencies remain in “a precarious situation” in regard to regulation:

“Regulatory systems are primarily reactive and laws haven’t necessarily caught up to the innovation of digital assets quite yet. The financial reporting standards in the US which are set by GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) don’t currently directly address the accounting for cryptocurrencies. Nuances like this make auditing business activities involving digital assets and cryptocurrencies inherently difficult.”

The Big Four’s relationship with cryptocurrencies

The Big Four is a commonly accepted term used to refer to the four biggest auditing firms in the world: Ernst & Young (EY), PwC, Deloitte and KPMG. Handling the vast majority of audits for companies around the world, both private and public, they are considered a cornerstone of the mainstream financial world.

Notably, during the past few years, the Big Four have been showing particular interest in the crypto industry. However, all of the major auditors have established long-term blockchain roadmaps to remain relevant in the space.

PwC has arguably been the most active Big Four company when it comes to cryptocurrencies. It started accepting bitcoin (BTC) for its services back in 2017 and announced a training program to enhance its employees’ blockchain knowledge in the following year.

Further, PwC has also recognized the regulatory uncertainty, naming it one of the main obstacles on the road to mass blockchain adoption in its 2018 report entitled “Blockchain is here. What’s your next move?” The Big Four giant had also pinpointed the lack of insurance as another problem hindering crypto businesses in a separate interview with Reutres.

Moreover, PwC has not only recognized the importance of the field, but has started to explore it firsthand. First, in May 2018, the auditing firm invested in VeChain, a major cryptocurrency project specializing in the Internet of Things (IoT), supply chain management and anti-counterfeiting.

In March 2019, PwC began conducting a trial of its blockchain-powered platform for ensuring the integrity of employee credentials. By the end of the same month, the company had become the top recruiter for blockchain-related jobs on headhunting platform Indeed, being responsible for as many as 40 blockchain-related job offers there (EY had 17, Deloitte had 10, while KPMG didn’t have any offers). PwC had 400 blockchain experts on board in 2018 to cater to cryptocurrency-related clients, according to the Financial Times, while this number could be higher at this point.

“We are devoting significant resources to how we might provide audit services in not just cryptocurrency, but blockchain,” a PwC representative told the publication at the time.

However, PwC wasn’t the first Big Four venture to adjust its auditing tools for the needs of cryptocurrency companies. In that sense, it has been outraced by the competing EY, which rolled out its blockchain analytics program called “Blockchain Analyzer” in April 2018.

So, can PwC’s new solution outshine its rivals in the crypto space and will it actually have an impact on the industry at all?

Details about the new version of Halo

As PwC stated in the press release, the tool newly added to its Halo auditing suite can be used to “provide assurance services for entities engaging in cryptocurrency transactions.”

The firm claims that, after the update, the Halo suite permits PwC to provide independent evidence of private-public key pairing, which is used to establish crypto asset ownership.

“Proof of ownership is really the main blocking point,” notes Tsai of Wave Financial. He told Cointelegraph:

“We had a California state auditor come into the office who struggled to grasp what ‘ownership’ of cryptocurrencies looks like. Auditors are used to custodial statements, paperwork and other forms of ‘proof’. With the blockchain, only your private key proves ownership, which makes it difficult to show ownership without exerting control over the funds (moving them around, etc.).”

Therefore, if Halo can actually prove ownership of funds and auditors can trust the tool, it would “speed up audits and cut costs and headaches,” Tsai concluded.

Raffone also argued that Halo might prove to be efficient, given that it focuses on a specific on-chain audit niche:

“This is a useful tool for sure, focused on transactional history and balances which seems suitable for institutional investors and fund managers, entities that normally require audits relating to financial transactions and assets ownership.”

Further, PwC’s Halo can now reportedly gather information about transactions and balances from blockchains. That, according to Martin of Blockforce Capital, is also a potentially effective feature.

“The Halo platform offers an easy-to-use way for firms to access blockchain information without having to spend manpower and resources that could be better spent somewhere else,” Martin told Cointelegraph, elaborating:

“For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain is open-source and can be viewed by anyone. However, just because the information is available doesn’t mean it doesn’t require a unique skill set to access.”

According to PwC, the upgraded version of the Halo suite is already being employed to support audits of clients involved with cryptocurrencies and assisting companies for which the firm is not the auditor in implementing processes and controls necessary to obtain assurance reports from their auditors. Theoretically, that could ease cryptocurrency-related audits not only for PwC, but the industry at large.

Still, the Big Four firm notes that the tool has its limitations: namely, client’s control environment, and, “at this stage,” the breadth of tokens supported by Halo. The software reportedly supports bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin gold (BTG), bitcoin diamond (BCD), litecoin (LTC), ether (ETH), OAX (ERC-20 token) and XRP.

“These considerations will be key when determining whether we are comfortable to accept an audit engagement,” PwC wrote in the press release.

It is currently unclear whether Halo is deployable in all 158 countries that PwC claims to be operating in. Cointelegraph has reached out to the Big Four company to clarify this, but has not heard back as of publication.

Experts suggest that the vast geography should not be a problem for Halo, however. ACCA’s Vaidyanathan reminded that the international auditing standards (ISAs) apply globally when asked about potential clashes.

Raffone of Finetiq, in turn, stressed the technical nature of PwC’s solution:

“The audit function provided by Halo is purely technical and doesn’t seem driven by any regulatory requirement, therefore it seems a ‘upon request’ service that can be deployed across jurisdictions. Although I don’t think Halo fills any regulatory need per se currently, it is certainly comparable to similar investment fund audit services and once the crypto industry becomes mainstream, I would expect this sort of audit service to be required by regulators.”

Martin maintains a similar position. According to the Blockforce Capital’s CIO, PwC should be well-poised to take on the regulatory complexities, given its experience with running auditing and accounting practices in multiple countries:

“While adjusting to different jurisdictions is difficult, PwC is in a great position to take on the task. They are a highly respected accounting firm and have the resources to apply to such an endeavor.”

Do things get better as we go along?

In the end, the problem seems to come down to the aspect of adoption: While the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow, the recognition from mainstream corporations — such as the Big Four — could speed up this process. That is why PwC's work with Halo is “validating” the institutionalization of the crypto space, in Tsai’s view.

On the other hand, the need for crypto-specific audits could be fulfilled even without the participation PwC, Deloitte and others, according to what Raffone told Cointelegraph:

“A whole host of specialist firms are emerging as leading crypto audit service providers, challenging the Big Four and their cost structure. Even IBM is getting in the game with a recently patented solution to audit blockchains.”

While time will tell if Halo turns out to be a viable solution for the crypto space, the remaining Big Four players have now been challenged to release their own software that would be on par with Halo in terms of functionality.",,https://www.wired.com/story/firefox-vulnerability-coinbase-ransomware-border-hack/,"The week began with a tricky Google Calendar phishing scam and ended with Iran ramping up its cyberattacks against the US, as talk of war with that nation mounts.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are a juicy target for hackers, for at least one obvious reason: They’re full of money that can be drained remotely. This week, it came out that currency exchange Coinbase successfully fought off an attack that targeted its employees in an apparent attempt to do just that. The attack, according to ZDNet, exploited two zero-day bugs in Firefox. The first zero-day made headlines midweek when Mozilla confirmed that it had patched a bug which would allowed hackers to gain remote access to a Firefox browser and execute code. In order for that first bug to work, though, hackers needed a second bug to let it execute the code. Turns out, before Mozilla’s patch, the hackers had both, and had attempted to compromise Coinbase employees so they could breach their network and steal money. Luckily, not only did Coinbase and an outside researcher notice the bugs, but Coinbase picked up on the attack before any money could be stolen or the network could be infiltrated.

When Customs and Border Protection confirmed last week that one of its biometric surveillance contractors had been breached, it apparently underplayed how bad the situation was. And to be honest, it already sounded bad. At the time, the agency said that 100,000 images of faces and license plates of immigrants, citizens, and asylum seekers had been stolen and leaked online, but that none had shown up on the dark web. Now The Washington Post says there is actually far more sensitive information from the breach spreading across the internet. “So much material, totaling hundreds of gigabytes, that The Washington Post required several days of computer time to capture it all,” the Post writes. Rather than showing the product of a single government surveillance contractor, the Post reports that the documents reveal a vast surveillance network the government is hoping to keep under wraps. The data includes details of ongoing surveillance—including nondisclosure agreements with Microsoft and Northrop Grumman, Homeland Security handbooks, surveillance budgets, hardware blueprints, and schematics—as well as future plans for expanding facial recognition programs. All told, the data reveals the inner workings of a vast surveillance network at the border, and how it relies on a small group of private companies and contractors.

Baltimore is fighting the good fight. Since ransomware attackers took over its networks on May 8, the Maryland metropolis has vowed not to pay them, struggling to provide city services as its networks remain frozen. Not so in Florida, where the city of Riviera Beach opted instead to pay the hackers who have held their computers hostage for the past three weeks the $600,000 they demanded. The Palm Beach suburb’s leaders said they felt they had no choice but to pay.

Selon les sondages, 81% de la population n’a encore jamais acheté de crypto-monnaies. Encore plus révélateur, seulement 10% estiment « comprendre correctement comment les crypto-monnaies fonctionnement ». Ces chiffres en disent long sur l’état d’avancement de l’adoption de la technologie. Le marché a encore besoin d’être éduqué sur le sujet, et cela passe par des initiatives comme Coinbase Earn par exemple.

En effet, une grande partie de la population est pour l’instant insensible aux valeurs ajoutées des crypto-monnaies. Beaucoup de réticence persiste même. Seulement 14% de ceux qui n’en ont encore jamais utilisé, estiment avoir à le faire dans le futur.

(Reuters)

Facebook Inc. unveiled plans for a new cryptocurrency called Libra this week. When it launches in 2020 or later, it will be a stablecoin – a digital currency that doesn’t fluctuate much because it’s supported by established government-backed currencies and securities. The world’s largest social media company published a 12-page white paper on Libra and has more than 20 partners for the project. But there are still many questions.

After a week of analysis, here’s what Bloomberg reporters and editors know about Libra, along with key unknowns that remain:

Joe Weisenthal, executive editor: digital news at Bloomberg:

For sure: Libra is being touted as a cryptocurrency, so it’s natural to use existing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum as mental models for what it could be. But it’s probably better to think instead about traditional peer-to-peer payment networks. Whether you’re talking about PayPal, Venmo, Square, WeChat, or even Western Union, all of these networks are in some way layered on top of the traditional financial system in order to ease some type of transaction (e-commerce, check-splitting, remittances). The problem is that these networks aren’t interoperable, and in many cases the fees can be quite high. Like all these other networks, Libra will be layered on top of the existing financial system, since each coin will be backed by traditional money in the bank to support a stable price. Unlike these other networks, however, there is an opportunity to create payments unification on a global scale, and at potentially a much lower cost. And in theory, anyone will one be able to build payment applications on top of Libra. Some might focus on friends splitting the cost of dinner. Others might be focused on remittance payments to developing markets. In the most extremely successful version of Libra, it’s not so much a cryptocurrency, but a global operating system for moving fiat money around.

Unanswered: There are basically two ways to hold a cryptocurrency. One is you can hold your coins with a custodian, or in a custodial wallet. If you buy your Bitcoin on a site like Coinbase, you can just leave it there, and they’ll hold it for safekeeping. The drawback is that you’re trusting Coinbase, which is a regulated entity. If law enforcement comes after you, and says you’re engaged in some illegal activity, Coinbase can freeze you out of your account and your Bitcoin might as well be gone. The other way to hold Bitcoin is in your own, non-custodial wallet. This entails keeping the cryptographic keys that unlock your coins in your own hands. This could be on your phone, on your computer, on a USB drive, or even on a piece of paper that you keep in a safe deposit box. The drawback is if you lose your keys, then your Bitcoin is gone forever. The advantage is that you have the freedom to do whatever you want with them, and it’s very difficult for law enforcement to do anything about it. The question for Libra is whether a user will be able to hold their coins in a truly non-custodial wallet. Can I keep access to the coins on a piece of paper? Or on a thumb drive? And if so, how will Libra stop someone from transferring that piece of paper to a criminal, or someone in a country that has banking sanctions against it? Facebook says its currency will have mechanisms to defeat illegal activity. But if users can take their keys into their own hands, it’s unclear how Libra will prevent them from being given over to a bad actor. And if Facebook doesn’t have a guaranteed way of preventing this, then will regulators really let it get off the ground?

Kurt Wagner, Bloomberg social-media reporter:

For sure: Facebook is aware that people don’t want to mix their financial data with other personal data, like the information they post to their Facebook profile. So Facebook created a new subsidiary, Calibra, that will build and maintain the company’s digital wallets and work on the Libra cryptocurrency. Facebook’s blockchain boss, David Marcus, says Calibra will store this financial data on separate servers, and won’t share it with Facebook.

Unanswered: Facebook makes almost all of its money from advertising, and it’s unclear how exactly it plans to generate profit from Libra. Under Calibra, Facebook will build new digital wallets into its WhatsApp and Messenger services to make it easier for people to send money to contacts. That could open the door for Facebook to expand into payments and commerce. While messaging apps have been a successful portal for these kinds of activities in Asia, it has been less popular in the U.S., and it’s unclear if people will actually trust a new cryptocurrency invented by Facebook.

Olga Kharif, Bloomberg cryptocurrency reporter:

For sure: Libertarians and crypto geeks have flocked to Bitcoin because it’s not controlled by any government or corporation. Anyone with computers can support the network and help it verify transactions. Libra will be, at least initially, controlled by about 100 organizations–mostly companies. That’s likely to rub crypto diehards the wrong way. It’s even rubbing Bitcoin skeptics the wrong way because they see it as essentially a way for corporations to start minting money. Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics and international business at New York University Stern School of Business, called Libra “a Monopoly scam.” David Marcus, who heads the Libra project at Facebook, said the network will eventually become distributed, but he hasn’t said when that will happen.

Unanswered: Libra is not necessarily intended to appeal to the crypto faithful, of course; instead, it’s targeting the 1.7 billion unbanked people globally. With Libra, they’ll be able to have something similar to digital bank accounts at companies like Facebook. The problem is, unlike traditional banks, it’s not clear that these accounts will pay interest on deposits. Most other digital wallets for holding crypto don’t pay interest. Facebook emphasized that it doesn’t provide banking services.

Robert Schmidt and Ben Bain, financial regulation reporters at Bloomberg:

For sure: Facebook’s rollout of the Libra coin was close to a disaster in Washington. The negative response in D.C. could threaten its ambitious plan to release the digital tokens by the middle of next year–and reinforces the notion that Silicon Valley companies have no clue how to operate in the nation’s capital. Democrats were quick to lambaste the social media behemoth for jumping into the crypto fray while so many questions still linger about Facebook’s commitment to consumer privacy, its digital market power and the company’s role fueling fake news and Russian-sponsored political attacks in the 2016 election. Republicans were more muted in their response. One thing both sides agreed upon is the need to haul Facebook executives up to Capitol Hill for a public interrogation about Libra. Expect to see them in the next few weeks being sworn in before the Senate Banking and the House Financial Services Committees.

Unanswered: Who will step into the regulatory breach? No single U.S. agency is charged with overseeing cryptocurrencies–a situation that has allowed digital coins to flourish but also made it relatively easy for criminals to use them for laundering money, dealing drugs and ripping off consumers. With the potential of Facebook’s two billion-plus users joining the crypto universe, the government will be forced to confront its laissez-faire policies. Federal supervision of digital money could be streamlined and increased. More than half a dozen regulators have some jurisdiction over cryptocurrency and they will likely vie to take more prominent roles. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, because of their expertise monitoring markets, are the leading candidates. Congress, too, could help set new rules. But it would have to pass legislation, an unlikely prospect before the 2020 U.S. elections.

Jenny Surane, Bloomberg finance reporter, and Julie Verhage, Bloomberg’s fintech reporter:

For sure: Facebook needs support from incumbent financial institutions to win consumers’ trust and gain traction in payments. Banks’ initial absence was noticeable, although the project has the backing of the largest payment networks, Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. Facebook also hired a slew of former PayPal employees to help with Libra.

Unanswered: How many companies will really work together to make Libra a success? Historically, Visa and Mastercard have been adamant that they only allow fiat currencies on their networks. Banks have also been vocal about the fact that they cannot traffic in cryptocurrencies because of money laundering risks. It’s also unclear if anyone else will join the party. Facebook has said it hopes to have 100 members join the currency’s governing body by next year and the Libra Association is in talks with the largest U.S. banks about teaming up. Citigroup Inc.’s boss said he’d consider it.",2019-06-23 20:47:12+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-neo-xmr-btc-bnb-eth,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

For the agile trader, cryptocurrency trading offers a great opportunity to earn huge returns within a short span of time. It is also uncorrelated to other asset classes, hence, it can act as a safe haven investment during an economic crisis.

In Brazil, which is reeling under a slowdown and high unemployment rate, 1.5 million people are investing in cryptocurrencies compared to the local stock markets called B3, which has 1 million investors.

However, history has shown that if traders do not book profits or protect their paper profits, all their gains can vanish and bury the traders in huge losses. Therefore, do not chase prices higher and do not get overly greedy.

NEO/USD

Neo (NEO) was the best performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The official Twitter page reported a fake website misleading token holders on the pretext of NEO 3.0 token swap. Can the digital currency pick up momentum and play catch up with other altcoins? Let us find out.

The NEO/USD pair has scaled above both moving averages, which are on the verge of a bullish crossover. This is a positive sign and indicates advantage to the bulls. The up move might face selling in $20–$25 zone. Hence, a couple of weeks of consolidation or a minor correction cannot be ruled out.

However, if the sentiment remains positive, we anticipate the bulls to eventually push the price above $25, which is likely to start a new uptrend. The next target to watch on the upside is $42.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair struggles to ascend the overhead resistance zone. In such a case, a few weeks of consolidation cannot be ruled out. The support on the downside is closer to $11.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) was the second-best performer in the past seven days as it rallied about 20%. Currently, the community is focused on the first-ever Monero Konferenco on June 22 and 23. Could the price react positively to the events and continue its up-move in the coming weeks? Let’s analyze.

The XMR/USD pair has continued to move up smartly for the past two weeks. It can now rise to $150. This level had acted as a major roadblock between June and September of last year.

However, the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which indicates that bulls have the upper hand. They are likely to attempt to ascend $150. If successful, the pair might start a new uptrend that can carry it to $299, with minor resistance at $218.833 that is likely to be crossed.

Conversely, if the bears defend $150, it might remain range bound between $81.167 and $150 for a few weeks. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns around and plummets below $81.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has continued its momentum in the past week that has forced players sitting on the sidelines to jump in. As a result, bitcoin’s price surged from $10,000 to $11,000 within 24 hours.

Not only the price has moved up; bitcoin’s hash rate also rose to a new high during the week. The open interest in bitcoin futures on CME hit a new high, which shows increased institutional interest. To cater to this higher demand, Galaxy Digital will introduce crypto options trading, which can be used by larger players for hedging purposes.

After the recent price action, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said that bitcoin can easily hit new lifetime highs. Not only analysts, traders and bitcoin enthusiasts are positive on the cryptocurrency; Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he was positive on bitcoin as a store of value and is long on it.

Within two weeks, the BTC/USD pair skyrocketed from $7,513.79 to $11,165.69. That is a rally of 48.60% within a short span of time. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in overbought territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand.

The pair is now likely to move up to $12,000 which is a critical resistance. Previously, this level had repeatedly posed a stiff challenge for the bulls. After such a sharp up move, we anticipate the digital currency to enter a minor pullback or a consolidation closer to $12,000.

Any dip will find support at $10,000 but if this level breaks, the cryptocurrency will re-enter the ascending channel. It will signal a deeper correction if it breaks down of this channel.

Contrary to our assumption, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $12,000, it can spike to $16,000, but we give this a very low probability of occurring in the short term.

BNB/USD

Leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced a bitcoin-pegged token on its blockchain Binance Chain that will be 100% backed by bitcoin. It will be available to trade both on Binance and its decentralized exchange Binance DEX.

A report by Binance Research claimed that Facebook’s Libra stablecoin can boost cryptocurrency volume because it is likely to generate interest from both institutional and retail players.

Most institutional players expect bitcoin to maintain its supremacy in 2019, according to a survey of institutional and VIP clients of Binance. However, the survey shows that respondents did not consider the crypto foray of Facebook, Samsung or JPMorgan Chase as the future drivers of the asset class. With consistently improving fundamentals, can binance coin (BNB) extend its up move? Let us find out.

The BNB/USD pair is one of the strongest major cryptocurrencies as it continues to make new lifetime highs on a regular basis. This shows that the market participants are positive that the uptrend will continue. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in command. If the bulls scale and sustain above $38.6463356, a rally to $46.1645899 and above it to $56.0786952 is probable.

On the other hand, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, a few weeks of range bound action between $28 and $38.6463356 is possible. A minor correction or a few weeks of consolidation will be a healthy sign.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $28 and the 20-week EMA. In such a case, a deeper correction can be expected.

ETH/USD

Grayscale Investments launched OTC trading in Ethereum-based security Grayscale Ethereum Trust last week. This gives an opportunity to the traders to invest in ethereum (ETH) without actually holding the cryptocurrency. Can the largest altcoin by market capitalization extend its up-move or is it time for a correction to set in?

The ETH/USD pair is knocking on the doors of the overhead resistance at $322.06. The moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought level, which indicates a trend change.

A breakout and close above $322.06 can propel the price to $480 as there are no major resistance levels in between.

On the other hand, if the bulls fail to push the price above $322.06, it might remain range-bound between $225.39 and $322.06 for a few days. The trend will turn down if the bears sink the pair below the critical support of $225.39 and the moving averages.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cabbagetech-crypto-scheme-operator-pleads-guilty-to-wire-fraud,"46-year-old New York resident Patrick McDonnell admitted to stealing funds obtained from his clients instead of investing them in cryptocurrency, Bloomberg reports on June 21.

Per the report, McDonnell — who calls himself the “coyote of Wall Street” — pleaded guilty to wire fraud on Friday in federal court in Brooklyn. He allegedly declared:

“I claimed to invest it in virtual currency and spent it on personal expenses.”

McDonnell attracted investors to his firm CabbageTech by claiming on social media to have traded over $50 million worth of bitcoin (BTC) for thousands of clients. Bloomberg reports that, instead of investing in the interest of his clients, McDonnell appropriated the funds for his own use and spent at least $194,000.

U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Richard P. Donoghue unsealed a nine-count indictment against McDonnell on March 26, the same day as his arrest. Donoghue stated in a press release:

“As alleged, the defendant defrauded investors by making false promises and sending them fraudulent balance statements, hiding the fact that he was stealing their money for his personal use.”

Italy has had its share of economic problems in the past decade and a growing number of its citizens blame the euro for their country’s misfortunes. Italians, many of whom still prefer to use cash, are now turning their attention to cryptocurrencies such as BCH. Federico Pecoraro, the CEO of Chainblock, one of the first crypto companies in the country, thinks it’s the right time to enable more people and businesses to benefit from using decentralized money. He considers bitcoin cash a good candidate to become the world’s digital coin for daily spending.

Rome’s Troubles Create Conditions for Cryptocurrency Adoption

Italy is an interesting case in Europe. In certain aspects, the country is part of EU’s Southern Flank, a region facing serious economic and financial challenges in the past 10 years. On the other hand, it’s one of the world’s largest economies. And just like the rest of the continent, it has its own North-South disproportions in terms of industrialization and level of economic development. As a whole, Italy remains one of the most advanced economies, it’s the third-largest in the Eurozone and the eighth in the world by nominal GDP. It is also one of the largest exporters on the planet, including of high value added products.

The Italian economy took a hard hit from the 2008 financial crisis. The country’s problems were exacerbated by its huge public debt accumulated due to excessive spending by the government in Rome during the previous couple of decades. Since then, Italy has managed to catch up with the average Eurozone growth indicators. However, many ordinary Italians, over a third of whom live in poverty or risk of social exclusion, blame the adoption of the euro for the loss of economic power. Critics say Europe’s common fiat currency has been tailored to the interests of others further north.

In these circumstances, cryptocurrencies are gradually winning hearts and minds in Italy. Despite the ups and downs, the long-term trend in the economy built around decentralized digital assets has been mostly positive. Crypto winter, which seems to have passed already, has been a tough time for almost any company involved in cryptocurrencies, according to Federico Pecoraro, CEO of Chainblock. There has been an overall decrease in transactions in the Italian crypto sector during last year. “Media coverage has been quieter after March 2018 too,” the entrepreneur told news.Bitcoin.com.

Leading Italian Crypto Company Launches New Services

Chainblock is a well-established crypto company which started in 2013 as the first Bitcoin ATM operator in Italy. It has recently expanded its portfolio and now operates Chainblock Buy, a hybrid exchange for buying, trading and selling cryptocurrencies, Chainblock Buy With Cards which is a service for people who want to buy coins with debit and credit cards, and Chainblock Pay, a solution for merchants that want to accept crypto payments. The latter already has a prominent client – Vapor Art, which is the largest supplier of e-cigarettes in Italy. Pecoraro explained:

We love small businesses that want to accept crypto payments but we want to enable as many merchants as we can with a strategic market approach. Our goal is to provide affordable and scalable solutions for both big and small shops and spread real cryptocurrency mass adoption. We plan to enable 5,000 merchants to accept Bitcoin payments.

Pecoraro pointed out that Chainblock Buy With Cards and Chainblock Pay are the company’s latest products that were launched in 2019, while Chainblock Buy has been online since last year. At the same time, the company remains a market leader with its core ATM business – people can use its teller machines to purchase digital coins with fiat cash. “Our mission is to allow anyone to easily buy and spend cryptocurrencies, and we proudly support Bitcoin Cash from its beginning,” emphasized the company’s chief executive.

Like other crypto businesses with strong foundations, Chainblock has used the “winter months” in the industry to develop new products in order to expand its customer base. It also installed six new ATMs in 2018, including one device in a large shopping mall visited by over 8 million customers annually. “At the end of 2018, we had a 156% increase in transactions and a 144% increase in new users,” Federico Pecoraro revealed. He believes Italy has what it takes to become the starting point of an economic revolution that embraces cryptocurrencies and says this could happen sooner than people might think. That’s why, during a meeting with representatives of Banca d’Italia, the country’s central bank, his team proposed the conversion of some of the nation’s gold reserves into bitcoin. Italy actually has the third biggest gold reserve in the world, the businessman noted.

Pecoraro further elaborated that while bitcoin core (BTC) may have the role of a store-of-value currency at the moment, bitcoin cash (BCH) could be the cryptocurrency that would fit perfectly as a real global coin for daily spending. “We’re proud to support it on our products. Indeed, our clients have the opportunity to buy BCH through any of our services,” he stressed. The entrepreneur also shared details about the profile of his company’s customers. Most often, young clients buy online while older customers generally prefer to purchase digital assets from ATMs with cash.

“Italian people still use a lot of cash, and we give them an easy way to convert it into their favorite cryptocurrencies. The average Chainblock Buy user is a male aged 24-35 who wants to invest some money in cryptocurrencies, while the average Chainblock ATM user is rather a curious person exploring cryptocurrencies for the first time,” said Federico Pecoraro. “Our ATMs guarantee a unique experience through which people can understand how easy it is to buy bitcoin cash and bitcoin core.”

Italy is home to large diasporas from Eastern Europe, Africa, the Mediterranean region, and Pecoraro acknowledged that immigrants and guest workers were among Chainblock’s first clients. “In fact, cryptocurrencies are still the best way to send money worldwide, a cheap and fast way, especially in countries where there is no strong banking system. At the same time, due to strict KYC/AML policies, sending coins is not as easy as it was years ago and this could be a barrier for first-time users. We try anyway to do our best and we also expect to work soon on specific remittance products and services,” the CEO added.

Lack of Regulatory Clarity for Digital Assets Persists

Chainblock is operating as a crypto company that provides non-custodial services but it’s compliant with the applicable know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) requirements and is partnering with traditional financial institutions including the central bank. However, Italian authorities have so far taken few steps to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. In February 2019, lawmakers approved a bill introducing legal definitions for terms associated with the crypto sector such as “smart contract” and “distributed ledger technology” (DLT). The law, which is the first attempt to regulate some aspects of the industry, tasked the country’s Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale with creating specific technical standards DLT technologies will be expected to meet.

Despite the new legislation, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Italy remains largely undefined. Banca d’Italia has previously described them as “digital representations of a value” and some substatutory acts on money laundering have noted that coins can be transferred, stored and traded electronically, used as a means of exchange and to pay for goods and services. In early 2018, public consultations were conducted on the adoption of rules to govern the registration of companies dealing with crypto assets, and in December the Ministry of Economic Development selected 30 individuals to develop the country’s regulatory strategy regarding blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies.

The Italian securities regulator, Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob), has so far issued multiple warnings against unlicensed companies promoting crypto investment opportunities. Meanwhile, the debate on how to tax crypto holdings and profits continues. More clarity regarding cryptocurrency regulations in Italy and other countries is likely to come after the recent release of the international standards for virtual assets issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The intergovernmental body vowed to closely follow their implementation in member states within the next 12 months.

I don’t normally write the stories here at Cointelegraph — I edit them. But when I got an email from a publicist asking if I was interested in speaking with Ben Mezrich, author of “Bitcoin Billionaires,” and oh, did I want the Winklevoss twins to jump in on the interview? I couldn’t say no.

Ben had the lucky chance — as he calls it — to already have an in with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, as they had been portrayed as the Men of Harvard, slightly “bad” guys in his book that ended up being adapted into the film “The Social Network.” As Ben tells it, after he saw The New York Times article about their bitcoin billionaire success, a book about their crypto escapades that picks up right as their court battle with Mark Zuckerberg ends seemed to be an obvious next step.

The timing for the publication of “Bitcoin Billionaires: A True Story of Genius, Betrayal, and Redemption” couldn’t be better or more ironic. The book spends almost 300 pages detailing the journey of how the Winklevoss twins have succeeded in crypto to the extent that it has wiped away the stain left by their battle over Facebook’s origin with Zuckerberg, only to then coincide with Facebook’s public unveiling of the Libra cryptocurrency project.

However, Ben’s latest book involving both the Winklevii and Zuckerberg — which was reviewed by Cointelegraph this week — reverses his previous narrative of Zuckerberg as the good guy and the Winklevii as his opponents. But, as Ben explained, it wasn’t the writing that got it initially wrong, but the reality that changed the perspective over time. He told me:

“I think reality flipped everything on its head, not just in the writing of it, but Facebook went from being something that everyone saw as this revolution and Zuckerberg as this revolutionary that was going to free the internet and make us all happy, into something much more nefarious, and Zuckerberg is now somewhat reviled.”

And Zuckerberg’s cryptocurrency project has not been without criticism from those that align themselves more with the cypherpunks of the 1990s than with the Winklevii of today. That is an important distinction that Ben makes in his book, shown through the twins’ highly skeptical attitudes toward the manic bitcoin passion of Charlie Shrem and the slightly dangerous libertarianism of Roger Ver. The twins, albeit very sincere bitcoin believers, could kind of care less about the sacredness of decentralization.

When asking Tyler Winklevoss about Facebook’s Libra project, I expected potential scorn, derision, maybe even thinly veiled frustration about losing some crypto limelight to a past adversary. But Tyler surprised me with his even keel:

“So, first off, I think that Facebook being in this space is huge validation for it.”

I waited for him to continue.

“I think that if you are a company in 2019, and you don't have a crypto story or game plan, it's kind of crazy. And if you don't, I'm sure you’re scrambling around to get one. “Ultimately we think it's great validation in the space. I've read some of the technical papers and whatnot and it looks like it is evolving and they're still figuring out exactly all the details. But there's a plan to start, in some way move it to more decentralization. “It's still really early, and this is all one big experiment and iteration on the evolution of money. And I think it's really healthy that people are trying different approaches. It's not necessarily one size fits all. “If you're trying to be digital gold, decentralization may be the most important thing. If you're trying to be more like a currency, then perhaps you can give on decentralization for speed. So I think it is really good. All approaches are very valid and we'll sort of see how it plays out.”

On the straight and narrow

The main takeaway from Tyler’s comments throughout our entire conversation was regulation, regulation, regulation. Once you got past the “bitcoin does gold better than gold” standard line, he was ready to explain his somewhat unusual (what I would dub “hodler traditionalist”) views.

For starters, he was not onboard with my joking idea about selling “Bitcoin Billionaires” for actual bitcoin:

“Maybe you shouldn't buy it with bitcoin, because if you believe in bitcoin, it is going to only appreciate in value.”

According to Tyler, there is no reason for bitcoin to even become a medium of exchange or a “good currency” because of “how regulation is allowing that to play out, at least in the U.S.”

And now that he’s started speaking about regulation, he gets on a roll that is nevertheless persuasive despite being well-practiced.

“We need to speak the same language as the largest funds and players in capital markets today,” Tyler said over the phone, in as far a cry from a cypherpunk as can be found. “I think it's just really important to do things the right way. And that may not be the fastest way in the short term, but I think in the long term, it's the one that ultimately will bring in the right audience and be the pay-off in the long term. Our sort of motto is: Look, we're just trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race. And we're playing on a game board that not everybody else is necessarily playing on.”

“We're playing chess and, you know, there is checkers, but that's a different game and we’re not playing that.”

What bitcoin lacks

When asked about the upcoming Bakkt physically-backed bitcoin futures testing, as well as the seemingly never-ending process of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), Tyler continued to play the role of the tortoise in it for the long haul:

“I think that people, traders, investors and consumers will ultimately want to see the same opportunities to express opinions through financial instruments in bitcoin as they see in gold. But because we live in the world of cryptocurrency, there may be much more, too. There may be decentralized exchanges and more decentralized finance applications that you can't create outside of the crypto world. “I think you'd expect to see what exists in gold but also much more in crypto.”

This attitude toward regulation, compliance and doing things the “right way” came from the twins’ negative experience with now defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox, when they first started acquiring their bitcoin hoard. This is the main goal of the Winklevoss’ cryptocurrency exchange, the New York-based Gemini — to do everything the opposite of Mt. Gox.

And according to Tyler, doing things the right way is really the only way:

“We don't believe in hacking our way around regulation or being too clever about it. We are transparent. We go into the front door, not the side door or in the back door. And that's been our strategy and our DNA from day one.”

Ben Mezrich’s interest is piqued

According to Ben, Tyler’s passion for crypto and its regulation, obvious even over the phone on a group call, was one of the things that got him interested in the story and kept him interested:

“If there is a really, really smart person who gets incredibly passionate about something and everyone else is telling him that he's wrong, that often leads to that thing that changes the world. People who are very smart get truly passionate about something, and you have to wonder why. How did they get so into this? That’s sort of rabbit hole that you go down.”

In fact, Ben — who admits that he knew almost nothing about cryptocurrency before he began this book — has become a bitcoin evangelist in a way that is abundantly clear both in the book and in our conversation. He tells me this on the phone with the conviction of a true believer:

“There's no question that cryptocurrency is the future. That's the way we're going. It's the science fiction money that we read about. And now, suddenly, it's going to be adopted by everybody in the next couple of years.”

And Ben underlines that he was inspired specifically by the Winklevii, compliant, “right path” way:

“If you just talked to the Charlie Shrems and the Rogers of the world, it would frighten me, because it comes from this kind of crazy libertarian, anarchistic, Silk Road world, which is not something that would appeal to me, necessarily. But the way I think the twins came at it was completely different, and that perspective really won me over and it just made sense. “The idea of digital money and the idea of digital gold — and something that you trust because it's math and not people — just made a lot of sense to me.”

Ben’s goal in writing the book may have originally been to chase down his next interesting story, but his conversation with me sounds a lot like the Winklevoss twins in their early circuits of the crypto conferences — back when bitcoin was still in its nascency.

And according to Ben, people have seemed to take his past books to heart — as he noted that “Accidental Billionaires” and “The Social Network” actually launched many people toward Silicon Valley — which could spread the bitcoin gospel even further.

He told me confidently:

“I think this will launch all these people into this whole new world of money, and not just that, but the whole philosophy behind it.”

Tyler agreed with Ben’s assessment of the previous past influence of his books, noting that “if someone invested behind what Ben Mezrich found interesting, they’d probably have done pretty well.”

Ben concurred, joking that a hedge fund had once even wanted to rent him an office so that it could pick his brain as he searched for a new book topic. He didn’t end up taking the fund up on its offer.

Ben did add the caveat that “I foolishly never invest in anything I write about for a couple of reasons,” stating that he didn’t want to own bitcoin while also promoting his book, a highly moral stance for someone that also admitted he didn’t buy Facebook stock when writing “Accidental Billionaires” almost a decade ago.

Friend or foe?

I was curious how the characters that were portrayed in a more negative light viewed the book. After all, Ben had obviously gotten close to them in order to write a book that detailed all the various ways that BitInstant’s Charlie Shrem could be sweaty.

His answer also surprised me:

“Charlie loves it. Charlie read the book and the first thing he did was he texted me and said he cried, and thank you, thank you, thank you. “I think Charlie's a complicated character. So, even though you saw him warts and all, it really was his story. So, he liked it.”

Tyler chimed in to say, very seriously, that he and his brother Cameron are “cordial with everyone in the book. I’m friends with Eric [Vorhees], cordial with Roger [Ver], we’ve exchanged emails, obviously it's no secret that we've had our differences with Charlie, but that's all behind us now.” He went on, saying:

“I feel like we're all cordial and respectful of the different viewpoints and opinions we have and paths we’ve taken. “Everybody's entitled to their different views and philosophies, and you know we don't always have to agree, but we can respectfully have our differences.”

When I noted that his speech was more respectful than what goes on in crypto Twitter, he replied “someone’s got to set the example, you know?”

As for speaking with Zuckerberg for the second iteration of the Facebook-turned-crypto saga, Ben seemed doubtful, but as he said, “you never know, you never know.”",,https://micky.com.au/australian-crypto-tax-shocker-100000-bill-on-20000-worth-of-coins/,"An Australian crypto enthusiast paid five times the value of his coins in tax – and some Ethereum holders are also facing a huge bill under our crazy tax laws.

Experts have called for reform of Australia’s “unfair” and unclear Bitcoin and crypto tax laws.

Adrian Forza, the director of Crypto Tax Australia, said one of his clients had paid $100,000 in tax on coins worth just $20,000.

The shock bill came about because the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) rules require the value of the coins to be declared at the time they are received.

Forza explained his client had been paid in cryptocurrency for development work he’d performed for an overseas company.

He had to declare the $250,000 value of the coins when he was given them in January 2018 near the all-time high – but they were worth just $20,000 by the time his $100,000 tax bill rolled in.

“It was a disaster,” said Forza who has specialised in crypto tax law for two years now.

“That’s a really unfair outcome because he’s basically received cryptocurrency and the value has dropped significantly and now he has to pay tax on money he doesn’t have.

“This is something they will have to change as it is unfair.”

Ethereum isn’t original under crypto tax ruling

Forza said the tax office had also made some interesting crypto tax private rulings that many investors would be unaware of.

For example, the tax office considers Ethereum Classic to be the “original” coin and that anyone who held Ethereum during the fork and later sold it will be considered to have purchased the Eth for $0.

That means they will need to pay capital gains tax on 100% of the amount they received when they sold that Ethereum.

“In the crypto space people think of Ethereum as the original, but the ATO has said that Eth is the one that changed and ETC kept all of its original properties,” he explained.

Anyone who received Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV in the forks will face a similar situation.

“Any coins you received as a hard fork that will have a cost base of zero,” he said.

If you’ve held the coins more than a year, you are entitled to a tax discount, however.

Greater crypto tax law clarity around masternodes and mining

Forza called for greater clarity over the crypto tax rules around profits made through investing in masternodes or mining crypto and the definition of trading versus investing.

The head of finance at ASX-listed blockchain company DigitalX, Jonathan Carley, called for reform of the Fringe Benefits Tax to allow employees to be paid in cryptocurrency.

Carley, who worked in the auditing division of accounting firm BDO for seven years, said that unlike in the overseas example above, Australian companies who paid their employees, or for services, in crypto were liable for the Fringe Benefits Tax.

“It makes it really unattractive because the company gets whacked by paying FBT,” he said. “The company will wear the costs of around 47 cents in the dollar.

“You might pay people in a stablecoin but the ATO’s interpretation is that it is not a currency, it’s a cryptocurrency, and it attracts FBT.”

He said the ATO needed better definitions around different types of crypto – stablecoins, cyrptocurrencies at security tokens.

He also called for a mechanism that would enable crypto holders to carry back losses from one financial year and offset them against gains made in a previous year.

“During the crypto boom some people crystallized some serious capital gains which they have put into another coin which is now 75% down,” he said

Carley said they should be allowed to offset those losses against the tax they have already paid.

Crypto tax laws around investing and payments

He added there needed to be better definitions around the cryptocurrencies people use for investment and crypto people use to pay for goods or services. “They guidance at the moment is that it is on you as a holder and if you get it wrong, we will penalize you,” he said.

Neither Forza or Carley believed it was likely the ATO will ever shift to taxing cryptocurrencies on a ‘fiat in, fiat out’ basis, which is a popular suggestion for crypto tax laws on social media.

“I think that would be the preferred method for a lot of people but I don’t see the ATO moving in that direction,” Carley said.

Lack of understanding of crypto tax laws

Forza said the biggest issue with cryptocurrency taxation wasn’t due to the laws themselves, but with the lack of understanding of the laws among crypto enthusiasts

“The demographic is 25- to 40-year-old males and a lot of them probably haven’t invested in shares or even seen an accountant before,” he said.

He encouraged investors to keep detailed records and to take advantage of online services such as CoinTracking, Independent Reserve’s tax calculator, and TaxToken.

While none of the services are “100% accurate”, due to differences in where they source the exchange rates from, Forza said they were accurate enough for most investors in the eyes of the ATO.

“The ATO only expects you to make a reasonable effort,” he said.

He added that investors should also periodically download their transaction histories from exchanges, as sometimes exchanges such as Cryptopia shut unexpectedly.

The founder of Facebook group Australian Crypto Tax Chat (who in true crypto style did not want to be named) agreed that a lack of understanding of tax laws was a big issue.

“They don’t understand the difference between trading and investing and they don’t understand that if they haven’t pulled it out (of crypto into fiat), how there is a taxable gain – they don’t understand they’ve made a profit by trading one coin to another,” he said.",2019-06-24 02:15:28+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/major-crypto-exchange-bitfinex-to-briefly-go-offline-for-upgrade-next-week,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex announced that it will be offline for up to seven hours next week in a Medium post published on June 20.

Per the announcement, the exchange will go offline for up to seven hours to carry out system upgrades on June 26. The post further specifies that Bitfinex’s hybrid counterpart Ethfinex will also close for maintenance at the same time.

The downtime is similar to that announced by major cryptocurrency exchange Binance before its scheduled system upgrade in May. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, the exchange warned its users that deposits, withdrawals, and trading would not have been possible for roughly six to eight hours.

Bitfinex states that the update is meant “to enhance the stability and scalability of the iFinex matching engine.” During the upgrade, the platform’s user will not be able to trade, view, or access their wallets on the exchange.

Still, Bitfinex promises that traders are not required to take any action as their funds will be safe, no orders will be executed during the downtime, and users will not be liquidated during the upgrade.

Lastly, the firm notes that — if market movements are too volatile — the update will be postponed.

Bitcoin core (BTC) prices have been rising sharply over the last few weeks and people have also noticed BTC transaction fees have spiked as well. Now there’s a new gaming site called Guess Bitcoinfees allowing people to bet on the 24-hour average transaction fee for the next day and the site pays out jackpots in bitcoin cash.

You Can Now Bet on Guessing BTC’s 24-Hour Average Transaction Fee and Win Bitcoin Cash

At the time of writing, the fee you have to pay to get your transaction mined into the next block is $2.45 per transaction size of 226 bytes. Meanwhile, digital asset supporters have been focusing on the price of BTC, but many users have noticed the rising fees and mempool backlog. Furthermore, according to a live updating list, there are 6,519 unconfirmed transactions (txn) waiting in the queue.

Over the last two weeks, there’s been an average of 20-35,000 unconfirms in the mempool during weekdays. Because the dynamic BTC fees are always different, a new gaming site called Guessbitcoinfees.com has launched allowing individuals to make a wager on the closest average bitcoin core fee for the day. In order to play the game, you need a Memo.cash account and at least 10,000 satoshis (BCH) to guess.

You basically write your prediction in the message area in USD and for every 10,000 satoshis, your jackpot will be 10% of the total jackpot. The more satoshis sent, the bigger the jackpot percentage will be, explains the website’s documentation. Players can wager multiple times during the day but only the final bet will be accepted. “The winner is the one whose guess is the least different from the real fees — If several players have the same difference to the real fees, the player who guessed first wins,” Guess bitcoinfees website explains.

Jackpots of Satoshis and Guess Tokens

There have been jackpots since June 13 and the website showcases each day’s winner. For instance, on June 22, a user named ‘lugaxker’ won a payout of around 9157838 satoshis. The person’s guess was an average BTC transaction fee of $4.00 and the actual average fee that day was $3.9984. The sites documentation details that the 24-hour average transaction fees for the BTC chain are obtained every 60 seconds from Blockchair.com. Guess bitcoinfees ground rules on the site state: “If Blockchair.com does not provide any data at 20:30 CEST, the last stored fee will be used to determine the winner — The won satoshis will be sent to the same address from which the winner sent his guess.”

Guess bitcoinfees says 80% of the day’s pot goes to the winner and the rest goes toward the next day’s jackpot, which continues to accrue over time. In addition to the daily game, Guess bitcoinfees also gives 1 ‘guess’ token for every satoshi bet. Guess token is a Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) token built on the BCH network. The game allows people to stake a bet, but it is also is an interesting reminder of BTC’s obnoxious transaction fees.

A good reminder of this is the current network fee ($0.0024) to get mined into the next BCH block. This means the fastest transaction fee for the BCH chain still pays far less than a penny to get a median transaction size of 226 bytes confirmed. It’s ironic that recently an SLP-based coin was created to be backed by BTC but allow someone to move the coin at roughly $0.0012-$0.0024 per transaction. Alongside this, we now have a betting game based on guessing the transaction fees BTC users deal with every day.

Following the announcement last week, Bitcoin has been seeing a resurgence in value, with the trailblazing coin reaching a $10,000 value for the first time since its historic 2017 record and crash.

Speculations surrounding Libra’s help in reviving cryptocurrency interest claim Facebook may singlehandedly bring the practical use of crypto into the mainstream. Nischal Shetty, founder of India-based crypto exchange WazirX, told Observer that “the entry by Facebook immediately provides a large validation for the entire crypto sector.”

For context, Shetty pointed out that the total market cap of cryptocurrency at the moment is about $300 billion, while Facebook’s market cap is predicted to be around $550 billion. The potential for the industry to cross the $1 trillion market cap when Libra launches is likely the reason many are rushing back to Bitcoin specifically, since it’s “the king of crypto.” Furthermore, regulators around the world now have more reason than ever to take cryptocurrency more seriously as a financial player.

Facebook’s Libra Project has already appealed to a large portion of the tech and finance industries. According to Facebook’s white paper, the initiative has received funding from Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, Uber, Stripe and Booking.com, among other, with each investing $10 million. Not to mention, the Libra Association is made up of 100 founding members who have given the project legitimacy.

“Historically, whenever a large player enters a segment, every other large competitor follows suit,” Shetty explained. “With Libra, crypto is witnessing the opening of doors to mass adoption.”

While Facebook’s crypto endeavors is being met with hesitation by government regulators, such as the House of Representatives, its roll out next year is already revitalizing its predecessors’ efforts.

“Libra definitely gave that much needed boost not just to Bitcoin price, but also to the entire sector as a whole,” Shetty said.",2019-06-24 18:22:49+00:00,https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/bitcoin-price-history-timeline-cryptocurrency,"The price of bitcoin topped $11,000 for the first time in more than a year on Monday as the impending launch of Facebook’s “Libra” fueled new optimism in digital currencies.

A slight uptick on Monday pushed bitcoin past the $11,000 threshold for the first time since March 2018. The leading digital coin’s value is up more than 170 percent so far this year.

Bitcoin’s price has climbed steadily in recent months as Facebook prepared to launch its digital currency, which, it announced this month, will allow the social media giant’s network of more than two billion users to transfer money and complete transactions without fees. Facebook’s entry marked the largest mainstream endorsement yet for cryptocurrency as a legitimate financial tool.

“Investors are scrambling back into crypto assets such as bitcoin and other alternate tokens, over optimism that they are becoming widely accepted and adopted by mainstream entities,” said Christel Quek, chief commercial officer for Bolt Global, a media streaming platform and digital wallet. “Facebook’s entry into the crypto space perhaps signifies the biggest network potential for digital currencies, capable of reaching into billions, and therefore indicates an upcoming shift in mainstream finance.”

Crypto projects from Facebook and mainstream financial institutions have provided a major boost to bitcoin, which is the largest digital currency by market capitalization and a benchmark for the concept as a whole. Bitcoin’s value rose as high as $19,873 as of December 2017, only to crash to dramatic lows in 2018 amid a series of cybersecurity breaches, exchange hacks and concerns about a lack of oversight or regulation.

FOX Business breaks down key milestones in bitcoin’s rise, fall and recent rebound below.

January 2009: Bitcoin is born

Bitcoin's creator, known only as ""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" unveils bitcoin as a concept, launches the bitcoin network and complete the first-ever transaction. Nakamoto's actual identity has never been definitely revealed.

May 2010: The first recorded bitcoin purchase

After posting on an online forum for bitcoin, developer Laszlo Hanyecz trades 10,000 bitcoins for two Papa John's pizzas valued at $25. At the time, the bitcoins were worth the equivalent of roughly $41, Vice reported. It is the first known transaction involving bitcoin.

February 2011: Bitcoin tops the U.S. dollar

The fledgling cryptocurrency trades higher than the value of a U.S. dollar for the first time in its history.

November 2013: Bitcoin hits $1,000 mark

The digital currency experiences its first major spike amid a surge in demand among Chinese investors and early scrutiny from U.S. government officials. Weeks later, a crackdown by the Chinese government sent prices sharply downward.

February 2014: Mt. Gox collapses

Among the first prominent bitcoin exchanges, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy this month after hundreds of thousands of bitcoins worth millions of dollars went missing in an apparent hack. The Winklevoss twins, who were early bitcoin advocates, were among the investors who lost assets when the exchange collapsed.

November 2017: Bitcoin rises above $10,000

After years of slowly gaining traction, bitcoin begins to attract attention from business leaders around the world. Japan legalized bitcoin in April 2017, and officials from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to hedge fund magnate Michael Novogratz weighed in with positive and negative outlooks about the currency's future.

December 2017: Bitcoin hits $19,873, its all-time high price

Bitcoin hits the peak of its popularity after two exchanges opened bitcoin futures markets. However, massive trading volume, price volatility and suspicious trading sparked speculation that the cryptocurrency was a bubble ready to burst.

2018: Bitcoin in freefall

A series mishaps contribute to a massive downswing in bitcoin's price. Exchanges in South Korea and Japan were hacked, officials in China and other nations increased scrutiny on the unregulated, decentralized currency, and tech giants Facebook and Google banned ads involving cryptocurrencies. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission blocked several attempts to launch bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin's price fell below $4,000 in December 2018.

2019: Signs of a rebound

Bitcoin once again spikes in value as Facebook and other institutions show signs of launching their own cryptocurrency initiatives. Facebook announces plans to debut ""Libra,"" a cryptocurrency maintained by an independent organization, in 2020.",,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/bitcoin-hits-15-month-high-propelled-facebook-s-libra-cryptocurrency-n1020926,"Bitcoin hit a 15-month high on Monday after jumping more than 10 percent over the weekend, with analysts ascribing the spike to growing optimism over the adoption of cryptocurrencies after Facebook unveiled its Libra digital coin.

The biggest cryptocurrency hit $11,247.62 on the Bitstamp exchange late on Sunday, its highest since March last year before pulling back slightly.

Facebook said last week it planned to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra, though the announcement immediately led to questions from regulators and politicians across the world.

Mati Greenspan, an analyst at eToro, said bitcoin's gains underscored growing optimism among retail investors that Facebook's plans were part of a wider trend of major companies adopting cryptocurrencies.

""Traders are speculating on future involvement of large players like Facebook,"" he said. ""They believe that Libra will create mass awareness of cryptocurrencies and act as a gateway to adoption.""

Other traders cited geopolitical factors from tensions in the Gulf region to the U.S.-China trade war as fueling interest in bitcoin, which has more than doubled in price since March.

Some investors have looked to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a hedge against possible declines in domestic currencies, traders said.

""Traders believe that Libra will create mass awareness of cryptocurrencies and act as a gateway to adoption.""

Cryptocurrency markets are opaque, and it is difficult to pinpoint exact catalysts for price moves. Bitcoin rose more than 10 percent alone on Friday night.

Thomas Puech of Enigma Securities, a London-based firm that specializes in larger size over-the-counter cryptocurrency deals, said growing tensions between the United States and Iran were ""gas"" for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

In late March, bitcoin broke out of a spell of limited price moves. It has since risen more than 160 percent, an ascent peppered by double-digit price swings that have reminded some of its retail investor-fueled 2017 bubble.

Bitcoin's volatility has been a boon to larger investors such as hedge funds, and other investors searching for returns as central banks across the world lean towards lower interest rates, said Puech.

Gold prices hovered near a six-year high on Monday, with demand for the safe-haven metal boosted by dovish signals from major central banks.

Bitcoin, which accounts for over half of the cryptocurrency market, has more than trebled in price since touching its lowest this year in January.",2019-06-24 13:10:00+00:00,https://futurism.com/crypto-ceo-quadriga-report-millions,"Bombshell Report

When reports emerged in early February that cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX’s CEO Gerald Cotten had died, the rumor mill immediately started spinning. Did Cotten fake his own death to run away with some $190 million?

While his death was later confirmed and the exchange filed for bankruptcy in January, there’s some truth to the wild speculation that followed Cotten’s death: he took the money after all.

Luxury Living

A jaw-dropping 70-page report by Canadian bankruptcy monitor Ernst & Young reveals that Cotten got away with some $200 million worth of crypto from QuadrigaCX’s clients. He appeared to have siphoned the money into fraudulent accounts for his and his wife’s personal use, as The Wall Street Journal points out.

And they took advantage of their newfound riches.

According to the report, the Cottens “acquired significant assets including real and personal property” in the last few years, “either personally or through corporations controlled by them.” Cotten and his wife even “frequently traveled to multiple vacation destinations often making use of private jet services.”

Anonymous Accounts

The report’s executive summary notes that “significant volumes of Cryptocurrency were transferred off Platform outside Quadriga to competitor exchanges into personal accounts controlled by Mr. Cotten.”

“Substantial amounts of Cryptocurrency” ended up in mysterious accounts, as well as the personal accounts of Cotten “and other related parties.”

To make matters worse, the monitor did not find any of QuadrigaCX’s financial records for the past several years, writing that “Quadriga appears not to have maintained a general ledger or traditional accounting records since at least 2016.” Cotten also did not record any company income on his tax returns, according to the report.

Fraud and Betrayal

It’s a damning report, to say the least. Evan Thomas, Canadian litigator, told CoinDesk that “based on the report, what [Cotten] did was clearly fraudulent and betrayed the trust of Quadriga users.”

And this mysterious situation is far from solved — so far, only $21.2 million in assets have shown up out of the $190 million that disappeared.

According to a report from local news source Interfax.ru, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseyev told journalists on Friday that among the options currently being discussed is to allow the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. Crypto payments are not on the table, however.

Worryingly for the country’s crypto community, the bill could still see cryptocurrency use banned outright.

Moiseyev said that the finance ministry had met with the Russian central bank and the Federal Security Service, the nation’s security agency, to discuss the bill.

“There is a range [of possibilities] from prohibition to the possibility of purchase,” he explained. “Like with foreign currency, it would be possible to buy and sell [cryptocurrencies], but impossible to use them for payments.

Sydney, Australia, June 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

The Australian Tax Office has allocated $1 billion to fight tax avoidance with particular emphasis on cryptocurrency trading. Not to worry - Australia Crypto Tax, an online tax calculator, takes you through the tricky terrain of calculating your cryptocurrency taxes so you can stay compliant.



Thought cryptocurrency purchases and sales are not taxable? That in any case these transactions are hidden, or at least that the government is not prosecuting yet? Think again.

The Australian government has identified that about 4% of its citizens have engaged in cryptocurrency trading and, for the 2019/2020 budget, are allocating $1 Billion AUD for the ATO to fight tax avoidance with particular emphasis on cryptocurrency trading. According to ATO representatives, ""the plan is to:

Obtain data from Australian crypto designated service providers – starting with data from the larger well-established providers, before moving on to smaller providers later in the year

Extend the ATO’s reach to foreign digital service providers – likely from any or all of the countries that Australia currently has a data sharing arrangement with.

The data obtained from these sources, particularly digital exchanges, will be used to identify the buyers and sellers of crypto assets and quantify the related transactions.”

The government is also on record stating they expect to get $3 AUD back for every $1 AUD spent - in other words to recoup around $3 Billion AUD by fining those who have not reported their taxes properly. The ATO will act effectively, since the pressure to deliver quantifiable results is from the top level and starting with crypto traders will be the low hanging fruit for the agency.

If realizing you may be on the hook for unexpected tax liabilities isn’t enough, the downturn in the price of bitcoin in 2018 resulted in significant losses for many traders. But there is a silver lining - the good news is that although bitcoin is rebounding, you can still offset any already incurred cryptocurrency trading losses against stock market or other capital gains, such as from real estate transactions. If your overall capital losses are greater than your capital gains this year, you may even roll forward the remainder of the losses into future years.

To do this accurately, however, you must figure out the precise tax consequences of every purchase and sale transaction, which involves complicated calculations and many hours attempting to do this by hand, or even with spreadsheets. But more good news - that’s where Australia Crypto Tax comes in, so you do not have to figure out any of this yourself, and instead can use their simple and affordable online solution.

So how does Australia Crypto Tax work? Will it help with filing taxes with the ATO?

AustraliaCryptoTax.com is a secure platform to easily upload your cryptocurrency trades and download your necessary tax documents.

It’s as easy as:

1. Create an account.

2. Upload your trades.

3. Download your report.

Are you still nervous? Don’t be. Australia Crypto Tax has screen by screen tutorials for each exchange and it will walk you through every click of the way. For Australian citizens specifically, no worries about USD to AUD conversions - you may import trades from USD exchanges and download a report from the application in AUD to provide to the ATO.

Head over to AustraliaCryptoTax.com to learn more about crypto taxes in australia and write off your crypto tax losses today!

*Accountants and other corporate clients or potential partners who would like to discuss customized implementations and service are welcomed to contact us, as well as individual filers.

After a miserable 2018 that saw leading cryptocurrency bitcoin (CCC: BTC-USD) lose around 80% of its value, 2019 has been a completely different story for the digital token. On a year-to-date basis through Saturday evening, June 22, bitcoin had returned 176%, which is about a ninefold better return than the broad-based S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. After being within striking distance of the $10,000 level for weeks, bitcoin blew through this psychological level and wound up briefly surpassing $11,200 per token.

The big question is, ""Why?"" Why is bitcoin suddenly finding success after more than a year of wallowing in the doldrums? The answer lies with a host of factors, rather than just a single catalyst.

Bitcoin soars past $11,000

To begin with, bitcoin's block reward is expected to be halved on May 21, 2020. Cryptocurrency miners -- i.e., people and businesses with high-powered computers that solve complex math equations to prove the validity of crypto transactions on a blockchain -- feast on these rewards, which are currently paid out as 12.5 bitcoin tokens per block of transactions proofed. At today's price, that works out to close to $135,000 per bitcoin block reward. But with this reward being halved in May 2020 to 6.25 bitcoin per block solved, investors and miners have historically bid up the digital token about a year in advance of a halving event.

Another reason bitcoin investors are excited is the possibility of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowing a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a major U.S. exchange. The SEC has delayed its decision on a bitcoin ETF on multiple occasions, but announced in early April that it wanted to hire a cryptocurrency specialist to help with implementing regulations. This move, along with the SEC currently taking comments and rebuttals on a bitcoin ETF, suggests that the prospects of a bitcoin ETF hitting the U.S. major exchanges are improving.

The recent announcement that social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would be creating its own crypto token, known as Libra, is also encouraging to bitcoin investors. Facebook has 2.38 billion monthly active users, and there's a really good bet that most of them have little or no clue what blockchain is. Libra is a means of educating the world about the potential for the digital ledger known as blockchain, as well as the utility of cryptocurrency tokens. Facebook plans to launch its new digital token next year, and the buzz leading up to this launch may drive bitcoin higher.

Face the facts: Bitcoin is fundamentally flawed as an investment

But in spite of all the reasons bitcoin is advancing, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world has three fundamental flaws that, as I see it, are practically impossible to fix.

1. Bitcoin isn't really ""scarce""

One of the more common arguments from bitcoin bulls as to why it's worth so much is its perceived scarcity. As noted earlier, proofing transactions does lead to inflation in the form of 12.5 bitcoin being added to the existing circulation per block. However, the maximum number of bitcoin that can be produced is capped at 21 million, with 17.77 million bitcoin tokens already in circulation. With an annual bitcoin token inflation rate of just 3.77% (until the halving in May 2020), optimists would argue that bitcoin's scarcity makes it an intriguing buy.

But there's a catch to this figure. Namely, there's no hard cap on the number of tokens that are in circulation. Rather, it's computer code and community consensus that determine this cap. Although it's unlikely that consensus would be reached to increase the 21 million token cap, the possibility of this happening is not 0%.

Comparatively, a physical store of value like gold is a finite asset. The gold that's currently in the ground, or has been mined, is all there will ever be on this planet, unless some miracle form of alchemy is invented in the future. That's in stark contrast to bitcoin, which could have its token cap adjusted based on community consensus.

In short, bitcoin really isn't as scarce as people think.

2. Bitcoin, like most digital tokens, has limited utility

A second fundamental flaw with the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap is that it has limited utility, or use. Optimists might hail bitcoin as a replacement for cash or the anti-banking currency, but it currently lacks the utility for broad-based adoption.

For starters, bitcoin's volatility is a big reason why most retailers won't accept it. Even with blockchain-based transactions that can potentially validate and settle faster than payments on traditional banking networks, the lag in settlement times can still allow for wild vacillations in the price of bitcoin. According to online blog Blockonomics, Dell, Expedia, Microsoft, PayPal, and Stripe have all dropped payment support for bitcoin. It should be said that while many of these companies cited volatility as a reason to drop bitcoin, variable transaction fees were noted, too.

Bitcoin's 17.77 million circulating coins are also a limiting factor. Since a good chunk of these coins are being held for investment purposes by a small number of wealthy individuals and traders, and are thus out of circulation for an extended period of time, there's simply not that many coins to go around for retail transactions and payments. Unless the bitcoin token cap was raised well beyond 21 million, bitcoin lacks the utility to spur fundamental monetary change.

3. You're buying into the wrong asset

Last, but not least, you're buying into the wrong asset when trading cryptocurrencies.

On one hand, there's the digital token, which is what cryptocurrency investors are buying. And on the other hand, there's the underlying blockchain, which is that aforementioned digital ledger that transparently and immutably records transactions. Blockchain is where the real evolution and innovation of the cryptocurrency movement lies.

Here's the problem: Buying a cryptocurrency token (bitcoin or most any other) does not give investors any ownership in the underlying blockchain. If the underlying blockchain of a crypto token becomes the basis for innovation at a particular company or within an industry, its associated token isn't necessarily going to benefit (and neither will token-holders). In fact, companies are developing their own tokens for use on in-house-created blockchains, or creating token-less blockchains that work with fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar.

If you want to invest in the underlying innovation of the crypto movement, you'd be better served by buying into a company like IBM (NYSE:IBM). Although IBM is still very stodgy in nature and living off of its legacy hardware and software revenue, it's also made an effort to be on the cutting edge of blockchain projects. IBM has been working with about a dozen banks in the South Pacific to improve settlement times on its proprietary blockchain network, and set up a joint venture with shipping giant Maersk in early 2018 to develop blockchain-based shipping solutions to revolutionize supply chain management.

The point being that if you want direct exposure to what matters (i.e., the underlying blockchain), you're going to have to buy stocks developing that blockchain, because purchasing cryptocurrencies like bitcoin won't cut it.",2019-06-25,https://qz.com/1651598/how-to-make-money-off-facebooks-libra/,"Since Facebook announced its planned Libra currency June 18, the bitcoin market has gone haywire. The original cryptocurrency surged from $9,000 to $11,000 this past week, as investors perceived Facebook’s crypto initiative as a vote of confidence in blockchain-based assets.

Bitcoin’s price has steadily risen since April, and this week, it surpassed $10,000 for the first time in 15 months—dating back to March 2018.

News of the Libra, and its effect on bitcoin, has understandably piqued the interest of crypto speculators, some of whom may be anticipating a Libra boomlet. For investors hoping to cash in on Facebook’s crypto plans, there are two obvious choices: 1) buy Facebook shares or 2) buy Libra—that is, when it becomes available in early 2020.

Cryptocurrency traders, in particular, might think Libra offers an enticing investment opportunity. After all, unlike most of its crypto predecessors, Libra will be backed by actual reserves, in this case, cash and government bonds.

However, while some of the underlying assets are interest bearing instruments, the spoils won’t go to the Libra holders among the general public. Instead, the project’s heavyweight backers—Visa, Mastercard, Uber, and the like—will collect any interest accrued on the reserves through Libra Investment Tokens, which also represent voting power over how the reserves are managed. Meanwhile, Libra users will simply transact using the currency tokens, perhaps gaining—or losing—ever so slightly because of periodic adjustments to the basket of reserves.

Think of it like this: Libra Investment Tokens are like shares in Bank of America, which derive value from expected future cash flows (in the case of Libra, the cash flows are the interest earned on the reserves). But the actual Libra cryptocurrency is like a check, which you can cash at Bank of America but is only worth its face value.

Rather than purchasing Libra, crypto speculators would probably be better off purchasing equity in one of the organizations which will own Libra Investment Tokens. Facebook expects the participant list to grow to 100 or more companies. That said, even investing in one of these corporations because of Libra doesn’t make a lot of sense, because their Libra-related earnings would be negligible. Investors may as well own government bonds directly.

A subtler—and perhaps more volatile bet—would be to buy bitcoin instead. Of course, it’s not backed by any reserves (or any government), but the short-term excitement about the Libra seems to be spilling over. Indeed, Libra could eventually trade alongside bitcoin on crypto exchanges, and considering Facebook’s reach, that may bring millions more people into the bitcoin economy.

For the moment, there isn’t a surefire way to cash in on Libra, but indirect bets could pay off handsomely.",,https://news.tradimo.com/libras-impact-on-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrencies/,"What happened to Bitcoin?

Many cryptocurrencies have had incredible runs in the past 3 months. The most well-known one – Bitcoin has almost tripled its value in this period and does not seem to be giving away any momentum as of yet, as it continues to grow exponentially, rising by about 40% in the last 2 weeks alone. Many say at least part of the reason could be attributed to the Facebook’s Libra announcement, however, is that actually true and how does Libra actually affect cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

Why is this important?

In general:

Hovering over $11,000, Bitcoin is trading at more than 50% of its highest value of Dec 2017. Some well-known investors predict Bitcoin at $100,000 within the next year, however, others say it’s already overvalued and is destined for a steep correction. In the face of the Libra announcement, is this the beginning of a monumental run or has another bubble just formed?

For investors:

In our recent article, we have discussed Libra, the newly announced Facebook currency, which is set to launch in the first half of 2020. Many met the news with big enthusiasm, as Facebook shares climbed, and cryptocurrencies followed suit. The expectation is that the new Facebook currency will make cryptocurrencies more popular and widespread.

However, the cryptocurrency markets were very slow to react to the news, as there was a muted reaction immediately after the announcement. Moreover, is Libra actually a cryptocurrency? For one, a key idea of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized, whereas Libra will be fully powered and controlled by one corporation. Also, Facebook has announced that Libra would have a value of around 1 USD, and it would be pegged to a basket of currencies. What that means is that there will be muted volatility on the price of Libra, unlike cryptocurrencies, which are completely free floating and extremely volatile. So, Libra will not be your typical cryptocurrency. That said, it can still shed some light on and propel alternative payment methods, cryptocurrencies being one of them.

Another thing to consider is that Facebook is not planning to launch Libra in developed countries first, as their target market will be users who do not have access to the most primitive financial services such as a bank account. That means that users in less developed countries will need to be educated about the new currency Libra before they can start to consider using other similar means of payments, such as cryptocurrencies. So, the big issue is timing. No one knows how much time it will take for Libra to become popular among developing countries, let alone be successful at all. So, it’s probably best not to base your crypto investment decision solely on the prospect of Libra.

For traders:

Bitcoin price in USD is currently trading at almost 60% of its all-time high, which was close to $19,000 back in December 2017. The price is nearing the closest resistance level of about $11,750. The nearest significant support is at around $8,000.",2019-06-25 17:17:35+00:00,https://www.investopedia.com/what-bitcoin-breaking-usd11-000-means-for-crypto-market-s-future-4691230,"Bitcoin, which collapsed to a low of $3,100 in December, smashed through the $11,000 mark on Sunday after breaking through the critical $10,000 level. Both levels were considered highly unlikely only a few weeks ago. At a price just under $11,000 on Monday evening, the world’s largest digital coin by market capitalization recovered over half its historic increase during the peak of the crypto frenzy when it neared $20,000 before crashing almost 75%.

Bitcoin's continued rise, which is also fueling rallies in Asian cryptocurrency stocks, illustrates the currency's resilience in the face of major skepticism and also cryptocurrency's widening acceptance by major established companies such as Facebook Inc. (FB), investment behemoth Fidelity, and others, as outlined in a detailed Bloomberg report.

Crypto Money Has Been 'Waiting on the Sidelines'

“The bounce back of Bitcoin has been fairly extraordinary,” said George McDonaugh, chief executive and co-founder of London-based blockchain and cryptocurrency investment firm KR1 Plc, to Bloomberg just after the virtual currency breached the key $10,000 level on Friday. It was the first time that Bitcoin had reached that level in roughly 15 months. “Money didn’t leave the asset behind, it just sat on the sidelines waiting to get back in.”

Some traders and ultra-bulls are betting Bitcoin can hit $50,000, per The Wall Street Journal.

This in part due to renewed mainstream interest in cryptocurrencies and the distributed ledger technology that it runs on. Facebook’s Libra is perhaps the highest profile crypto project, as the social media pioneer partners with companies such as Visa Inc. (V) and Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER) to build the system.

Asian Crypto-Stocks Gain Momentum Alongside Bitcoin Rally

The crypto rally coincided with a rally in related stocks in Asia on Monday, per another Bloomberg report. In Tokyo, GMO Internet Inc. jumped 7%, while Metaphs Inc. climbed 11%, Remixpoint Inc. 6.2%, and Ceres Inc. increased 4.4%. In South Korea, Vidente Co. increased 5.4%, and Woori Technology Investment Co. jumped 4.6%.

Supun Walpola, an analyst with LightStream, attributes gains in Asian crypto-stocks to Bitcoin’s resurgence. “Going long on stocks that have exposure to cryptocurrency is something that we have seen in the past during a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency bull run -- especially with those who want to avoid the volatility of crypto but at the same time want to have some exposure into these markets,” he said, adding that the increase in stock prices for these crypto companies typically increase more than the actual benefit that these firms would get during a crypto surge. This has “always resulted in immediate corrections,” Walpola wrote in an email to Bloomberg.

That said, investors should check themselves before investing in crypto stocks despite their relatively lower risk, given “such strategies have often gone wrong when crypto markets turn red -- which could happen just about at any time,” said the analyst.

While Bitcoin has eased back below $11,000 it is still dramatically higher than the $10,000 support level. Bitcoin's 2019 rebound – and that of other cryptocurrencies – will be tested by the latest calls by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for new global regulatory standards to bring cryptocurrency ""out of the shadows"" and to prevent illicit financing by criminals, terrorists and rogue nations. Crypto bulls say these rules would hobble the young industry, as outlined in another Bloomberg report.

Looking Ahead

Despite the growing demand for cryptocurrencies and signs that the long “crypto winter” is over, various headwinds threaten to pull Bitcoin back below $10,000, likely resulting in a downfall for the rest of the nascent industry. These risks position the digital coin for continued volatility as demonstrated in May. Alongside other downside drivers, the fact that bitcoins are used mostly for speculation, not commerce, has also been a main concern cited by bears.",2020-09-12 20:33:36.228000+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/there-are-now-more-than-5000-bitcoin-atms-around-the-world,"The total number of bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) worldwide reached 5,000 for the first time, monitoring resource CoinATMRadar confirmed on June 24.

According to the latest statistics, there are now 5,006 standalone BTMs in around 90 countries, where cryptocurrency users can buy or sell bitcoin (BTC). Some machines offer both services simultaneously.

The data caps a protracted period of growth in the BTM sector, with the U.S. leading the trend as more and more locations and formats appear.

June has seen a total of 150 installations, around 6 per day. General Bytes recently overtook Genesis Coin as the manufacturer with the largest number of BTMs installed.

As Cointelegraph reported, in 2019, it is not just the ‘classic’ BTM model which is expanding, but other methods of procuring BTC. A deal earlier in the year involving coin counting kiosk operator Coinstar brought bitcoin functionality to over 2,200 U.S. locations.

The U.S. currently has more than half of the world’s BTMs at 3,229, with a new pilot scheme this month bringing the machines to Circle K convenience stores in Arizona and Nevada.

“We are thrilled to be partnering with a respected organization like Circle K,” Marc Grens, president and co-founder of cryptocurrency provider DigitalMint said in a press release issued June 20.

“This partnership opens the door for massive expansion of Bitcoin access to new markets around the globe.”

Increasing competition in the BTM market is likely to reduce the fees charged to users, which tend to be noticeably higher than online alternatives.

Other in-person options, such as buying vouchers, are also gaining popularity with users keen on avoiding burdensome identity requirements.",,https://www.coindesk.com/ex-trump-economist-joins-crypto-central-bank-after-failed-fed-bid,"Stephen Moore, who recently rescinded his bid to join the Federal Reserve, announced plans to start his own cryptocurrency-based mini-Fed – billed as “the world’s decentralized central bank,” according to Fox Business.

A pitch deck sent exclusively to Fox allegedly said Moore has teamed with a group of unnamed entrepreneurs to develop a “central bank” – ironically called “Decentral” – aimed at reducing the volatility among digital currencies.

The bank will attempt to regulate the supply of crypto, just as the Fed controls monetary policy in the U.S. It will exchange its own dollar-backed token for other cryptocurrencies and use an algorithm to control the amount of stable tokens in circulation, Decentral officials told FOX. This stable coin is similar to Facebook’s Libra, and aims to promote uniformity and reliability among a fractured landscape of digital assets.

“I’m really excited about doing this,” Moore told the business media outlet. “I hope it makes me rich.”

Moore said he will officially join Decentral on July 1, as chief economic officer and report to Sam Kazemian, Decentral CEO. “These guys are super smart,” he said of his partners.

He also told Fox, he believes cryptocurrencies can circulate in the economy in such a way that they don’t conflict with the Fed’s monetary policy, adding, “This is an alternative way of making payments.”

Kazemian told Fox that Decentral isn’t trying to compete with the Fed, but plans to introduce their business model to Fed officials at some point.

“Decentral will solve the biggest problem facing regulators when it comes to the crypto space: The current instability of pricing,” he said.

“Our goal is to be collaborative, not combative,” he said. “The next big wave in the crypto space is a digital currency that is designed to be useful to consumers and keep stable prices instead of acting as volatile, speculative investments. Stable coins are the next big innovation in the crypto industry.”

It’s unclear how Decentral will convince holders to trade their crypto for this new token, or how the firm will act to prevent inflation – a core mandate of Fed – if the business does not have authority to act as a central clearinghouse.

Kedar Iyer will serve as chief technology officer, Travis Moore as director of software, and Henry Liu as chief operating officer —all of whom have backgrounds in crypto and technology startups. The remaining three partners have political backgrounds.

Mike Novogratz is cited as an investor in Decentral’s parent company.

Moore previously worked as an editorial writer for the Wall Street Journal, and was a member of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He is also a distinguished visiting fellow to the White House, following his advisement on President Trump’s 2017 tax plan.

Moore was picked by Trump in March to fill one of two vacant positions at the Fed, but had not been formally nominated. He withdrew his bid in early May after weeks of criticism about his political partisanship, shifting views on interest rate policy, and sexist comments about women.

His discussions with Decentral began at recent SALT conference, a hedge fund and investing confab in early May run by Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge Capital.

Created through a partnership with BitGo Trust, the retirement account features $100 million in insurance protection, 30 percent lower wallet fees, and the ability for clients to diversify their holdings in 12 digital assets.

As a self-directed investment, “the authority lies with account owner, who directs us on what to hold,” said Dick Corcoran, CEO of BitGo, who left retirement to work on this partnership and product. “The rules are identical to a traditional IRA, the only difference is the asset is crypto instead of stocks, bonds, etc.”

Bitcoin IRA began offering retirement accounts in 2016, and has built more than 5,000 hybrid crypto IRAs. Since launch, the company has processed over $300 million in digital asset transactions, according to its own figures.

Bitcoin IRA registered as a Third-Party Administrator for BitGo, through its Digital IRA division to handle all administrative responsibilities including transfer applications, compliance, and transaction monitoring.

BitGo will protect these new securities by providing cold storage “maintained in a secure, bank-quality vault offline in South Dakota,” with a clearly defined protocol on who can access the holdings, Corcoran said. Apart from physical security, Corcoran claims that the company also exceeds the regulators’ demands for the amount of capitalization and insurance behind the assets.

While he was unable to disclose those figures, but said the company acts as a fiduciary. “BitGo is a master engineer of risk and security, whether for largest institutional investor or someone beginning their retirement savings,” said Bitcoin IRA COO Chris Kline. “The whole spectrum will benefit.”

These investors are “very diverse. Not the typical archetype seen for traditional assets,” he said.

Every generation is apparently interested for different reasons, while Kline is proud of the general parity between male and female investors, as well as with the geographical spread. “We have clients in every state of the union.” “Except New York,” he adds after pausing to reflect on the requirement in the state for the so-called BitLicense.

Opening an account is instantaneous, he explained, but, because the firm “can’t automate compliance,” it may take more than a day to pass know-your-customer procedures. Additionally, funding one’s account can take as long as 10 to 15 days depending on the client’s current custodian.

Kline suggested that these new IRAs move at the speed of the internet and are a “solution raised from digital era built for digital era.”

At 21:00 UTC on June 25, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization broke from sideways trading after being held beneath $11,400 for over 11 hours.

However, perhaps most notable is the fact that bitcoin also crossed above 60 percent market dominance for the first time in over 17 months.

A metric maintained by data provider CoinMarketCap, the Bitcoin Dominance Index shows bitcoin continues to gain altitude at a time when broader confidence in the crypto market, now nearly $350 billion, has yet to return.

The move to fresh 2019 highs is further a welcome sight for the bulls who continue to enjoy the incredible 230 percent gains experienced from the beginning of this year.

Notably, the price rally was also accompanied by an uptick in the 24-hour trading volume as an increase of $13.8 billion was added overall, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

However, its “Real 10” volume – a metric that takes into account trading volume from exchanges reporting honest volume figures as identified in a report by Bitwise Asset Management, is delivering more sober results, currently standing up $4.09 billion, according to Messari.io.

Dominance Rate

Still, bitcoin’s dominance may be the broader story.

At press time, bitcoin’s market capitalization now records $202.8 billion, which is about $67.1 million more than the market capitalization of every other cryptocurrency combined – which currently stands at $135.7 billion.

Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like NEO, Ether (ETH) and Ontology (ONT) have gained between 2 to 10 percent value on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinMarketCap.

Eyes are now firmly set on bitcoin’s new target along the $12,0000 psychological price tag, last seen 17 months ago on Jan 28, 2018, signaling a very strong upward toward its all-time high near $20,000.

Bitcoin has been on a tear this year, rising almost 200% since the start of the year. There are multiple theories as to why, and one in particular is gaining traction.

It's being called ""the halvening"", an event where the rewards to so-called bitcoin miners are cut in half. To understand what that means, it's important to know how bitcoin's underlying technology — the blockchain — works.

Miners with high-powered computers compete to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever wins that race gets rewarded in bitcoin.

Currently, the number of bitcoins miners are rewarded in stands at 12.5. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. By May 2020, experts say, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoins.

""Bitcoin's current inflation rate is approximately 3.76%,"" Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at social trading platform eToro, told CNBC by email. ""In May of next year, it's scheduled to be reduced to 1.8%.""",2019-06-25

Facebook partnered with Visa, PayPal, Uber, Spotify, and other companies to launch Libra this month, a digital coin intended to simplify online payments and purchases.

Asset manager Fidelity has begun buying and selling bitcoin for institutions, online broker TD Ameritrade rolled out trading of Bitcoin futures in December, and securities brokerage E*Trade is close to introducing cryptocurrency trading on its platform.

""The primary drivers behind bitcoin's turbo-charged appreciation revolve around growing optimism over the cryptocurrency being accepted by the mainstream,"" said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. ""Libra has sweetened appetite towards bitcoin.""

However, he warned the cryptocurrency's gains aren't guaranteed to stick.

""Lessons from the past have illustrated how unpredictable non-traditional financial instruments like bitcoin can be,"" Otunuga said. ""With explosively volatile moves being nothing new in the world of cryptocurrency, bitcoin could still experience periods where it finds itself under sudden selling pressure.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/bitcoin-soars-close-to-13000-hitting-a-17-month-high.html,"Bitcoin skyrocketed close to $13,000 on Wednesday, notching a 17-month high and continuing a stunning turnaround for the cryptocurrency in 2019.

The digital currency surged as high as $12,919 in early morning trade, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index, which tracks prices from various exchanges.

That was the highest level the virtual coin had traded at since January 2018. It's now up 230% since the start of this year. Bitcoin last traded about 11% higher on Wednesday to $12,610.

It was the biggest gainer among some of the most popular cryptocurrencies, with ether up nearly 9% at $338 and XRP almost 3% higher at about 48 cents. Bitcoin's dominance of the market now stands at over 60%, according to CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin has enjoyed a spectacular rally this year as investors look to major companies like Facebook getting involved in the crypto space. The social media giant announced plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra last week. The digital token will be used for payments and is being overseen by a consortium of companies including Visa and Uber.

There are other theories behind bitcoin's move higher, including the idea that it may be viewed as a hedge amid ongoing U.S.-China trade uncertainty. Another reason for the rally, experts say, is that traders are anticipating a so-called ""halvening"" event next year that cuts the rewards to bitcoin miners in half.

The story in 2019 is in stark contrast with what happened in the market last year. Bitcoin plummeted more than 70% over the course of 2018, with other cryptocurrencies also falling sharply. That was after an almost $20,000 record high hit in late 2017.",2019-06-26,https://qz.com/1653270/bitcoin-price-is-on-an-eight-day-winning-streak-thanks-to-libra/,"Bitcoin, once buried, is back.

The original cryptocurrency is soaring, riding an eight-day winning streak to reach prices last seen in January of 2018, when it was coming down from an all-time high of nearly $20,000. At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading around $12,800, according to Coinmarketcap.

The eight-day streak is one of the longest on record for bitcoin, and also one of the strongest in terms of aggregate performance. The notoriously volatile asset has strung together streaks of consecutive daily increases as long, or longer, only five previous times. (This is according to closing daily prices using UTC time.)

It’s impossible to say exactly what has reignited interest in the cryptocurrency, which had fallen as low as $3,200 in December, but it’s almost certainly related to Facebook’s June 18 announcement that it plans to launch its own crypto token, the Libra, with a group of partners. While the two coins are very different—Libra will be pegged to a basket of currencies and overseen by a consortium, while bitcoin floats freely and is completely decentralized—the endorsement of crypto by one of the world’s largest tech companies, along with partners like Visa and eBay, appears to have nudged once tentative buyers into the market. Or, just as plausibly, enough speculators are expecting a flood of newcomers into bitcoin that they are buying it up in the expectation of a rise.

Either way, for bitcoin owners who shivered through a bitter crypto winter, the sun is shining on them today.

As BTC touched $13,000 today many are asking ‘am I too late to get in’. The long term answer is clearly a no, but there are still good gains to be made on Ethereum if it repeats the performance from 2017.

Ethereum Still Undervalued

Bitcoin may well be up 240 percent this year and hitting new highs every day this week but all is not lost for those that think they have missed the boat. Corrections will happen, they always do, but many are now claiming that there will no longer be any four digit Bitcoin available to buy.

Looking at the second largest crypto asset on the market shows that it is still massively undervalued, especially when compared to its bigger brother. Bitcoin is now less than 40 percent down from its peak whereas Ethereum is still over 75 percent away from its giddy height of $1,400 back in January last year.

Today ETH has managed to ride the coattails of BTC pulling in another 7 percent to reach $335. As noted by ‘CryptoFibonacci’ ETH could be approaching resistance again now.

Ethereum gains in recent months have been sluggish in comparison. Granted, ETH is up 150 percent since the beginning of the year but it did get battered over 90 percent from ATH.

Crypto twitter commentator ‘Bleeding Crypto’ has also observed this:

“IF missed the BTC run. You HAVE A SECOND CHANCE with ETH. Look at the historical Screen shots and see for yourself that ETH has outperformed BTC in ROI year after year. Unless you want to listen to those ignorant ***** that say ETH is dead. R U going to blow it with ETH too?”

Last year Ethereum shot from current prices in mid-November to top $1,400 just two months later. That is a gain of 325 percent in just a few weeks. Of course, there is no ICO boom this time around and Ethereum has been lacking fundamental momentum with Serenity delays, but the ecosystem still has huge potential for even bigger gains.

What About Other Altcoins?

Ethereum is not the only undervalued altcoin. Those Bitcoin maximalists on CT will be partying right now but if a repeat of 2017 is on the cards, altseason could be just around the corner. Many are way down, over 80 percent from their peaks, so potential for gains will be greater when funds start shifting into altcoins.

Total market capitalization hit $365 billion today, but Bitcoin holds $225 billion of it alone. It is only a matter of time before the ratio adjusts and Ethereum is likely to lead the way when it does.

According to a statement, the gang stole Bitcoin BTC from at least 4,000 victims across 12 countries. This is likely just the start, as more are beleived to have been affected; victims continue to come forward.

Following a 14-month long investigation, the group of five men and one woman were arrested at their homes in the south of England, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam, in a coordinated operation yesterday.

Beyond this, details are sparse, but it appears the group was running a website that impersonated a “well-known online cryptocurrency exchange,” Europol said in the statement. The law enforcement agency has not said which exchange, though.

It’s believed the group used “typosquatting,” a technique which uses misspelled URLs, to trick victims into thinking they’re on their desired website, when in fact they’re not.

The website impersonates the genuine site, and when the user attempts to log in, it will forward sensitive user details to the bad actors. These details can then easily be used to drain Bitcoin wallets and exchange accounts.

Another cryptocurrency scam recently used a similar tactic to run a fake token sale. Cyber-baddies impersonated Facebook’s Calibra website, with one minor change to the “i” in the URL. Rather than Calibra.com, the scammers use Calìbra.com to trick users into thinking they’re on the legitimate site.

If you’re new to the crypto scene you might have heard about people moving their assets into cold storage or cold wallets but were unsure exactly what this entails. Simply put, it means storing your crypto offline to reduce access to hackers. Here’s how you can easily freeze your coins for safekeeping.

Simple Hardware Solutions

To move your assets into cold storage using a hardware solution, the easiest way is just to keep the private key to your digital wallet saved as a file on a USB stick. This way the only way to steal your coins is with the USB wallet in hand, as long as you’ve made sure there is no other copy of the private key left on any device connected to the internet of course.

There are also tailored physical solutions for safekeeping coins, known as hardware wallets. These are simply data storage devices that are designed specifically for this task and they usually look like a USB stick but with a small display on them. Most hardware wallets include extra security features and support holding multiple types of coins simultaneously.

When you want to buy one of these devices, the Bitcoin.com Store’s hardware section offers a variety of deals on hardware wallets such as the popular Ledger Nano S and Keepkey.

Easy to Create Paper Wallets

If you want to store your coins offline and don’t need something as fancy as a hardware wallet, you can get a paper wallet for the unbeatable price of $0. As the name suggests these are just private keys printed out on a piece of paper, however, this does not mean they are any less secure. Paper has no USB ports and no wifi etc, so it is unhackble remotely and will keep your coins frozen until the time you want to use them.

There are many cryptocurrency paper wallet generators you can find for any type of cryptocurrency you want – just verify the source you choose is one that can be trusted. For example, Bitcoin.com offers a very popular paper wallet generator for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and you can even download the software to run offline.

When you want to check up on the paper wallet for balance and transfers, all you have to do is to enter the public key into a blockchain explorer. This can be done with any explorer for your selected cryptocurrency, such as our BCH block explorer.

With any option you choose to keep your funds offline, remember to store the wallet in a safe place, possibly also laminated or inside a ziplock bag to prevent water damage, where you won’t forget it or throw it away by mistake. Treat it just as you would a physical briefcase full of dollars.

Satoshi Citadel said the entry of institutional investors like Fidelity and the rollout of Facebook's own digital currency are legitimizing the cryptocurrencies.

Last week, Facebook said it was looking to launch its Libra coin in partnership with several financial giants like Paypal, Visa and Mastercard.

Miguel Antonio Cuneta, cofounder of Satoshi Citadel, said a highly anticipated event next year which will alter the supply of bitcoins will help propel the currency to new highs.

""If you look at targets, we're just at $200 billion market cap. Interest needs to hit 1-2 trillion [dollars] to be mainstream, and that would mean bitcoin at $100,000. That's the expectation,"" Cuneta said in an interview with ANC's Early Edition.

At 16:00 UTC on June 27, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bitcoin (BTC), suffered a steep correction in its price, dropping to a low of $10,300 after eight straight days in the green.

Prices attempted a rally above $11,300 with 30 minutes out from the daily close, which would have provided greater confidence in price consolidation for the bulls. Yet, instead, BTC closed on a down note below former resistance at $11,086.

BTC is currently changing hands at $11,067 and is down 14 percent over a 24-hour period.

As can be viewed above, BTC suffered a massive correction to the parabolic uptrend that had been ongoing for over two weeks. The move down was accompanied by a large surge in trading volume, with June 27’s daily total matching, if not, besting June 26’s postings across most exchanges.

For example, one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, Binance, recorded $2.1 billion in total volume alone, while Huobi Global and OKEx recorded $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion over a 24-hour period, respectively.

Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined suffered a $46.1 billion loss over the last 24-hours, marking the biggest single day loss in market value since May 17, 2019.

The total market cap is down from $372.4 billion to stand at $324.5 billion at press time while the total amount for BTC’s loss in value by trades end amounted to just over $33 billion.

Perhaps the greater story, howecer, is the altcoin market’s rise against BTC pairings, which has driven up their value while BTC continued to decline in price.

All but two out of the top 20 are in the green today, up between 1.3 and 15.72 percent and are demonstrating a small bounce across the lower timeframes.

The idea that traders have switched from BTC to altcoins in the short-term is supported by a change in the BTC dominance rate, down 1.41 percent over 24-hours, from 63.37 percent to 61.96 percent. This suggests traders are currently moving to tether (USDT) or major altcoins to conserve some profit from BTC’s violent drop.

The short-term remains highly volatile, so BTC could experience a brief bounce on today’s price action, but that will need to be accompanied by similar levels in volume in order to end the recent sell-off.

Speaking earlier this week, Iranian Energy Ministry spokesman Mostafa Rajabi said increased digital-currency mining within the country had made the power grid ""unstable"" and caused problems for consumers.

The warning followed the shutting down of two cryptocurrency mining farms in the central province of Yazd, state-controlled TV reported on June 27.

The report said the mining farms, located in abandoned factories, had about 1,000 bitcoin mining machines.

Rajabi said electricity consumption in the Iranian month of Khordad, ending on June 21, increased by 7 percent, and that a large part of the hike was the result of digital-mining activities that involved high-powered computers.

He said a special price had not yet been set for the power used by cryptominers, though the government is reviewing an Energy Ministry proposal for such pricing.

Rajabi said the power for mining each Bitcoin equaled the power used by 24 residential units for an entire year.

Media reports have suggested cryptocurrency mining is increasing in Iran due to the relatively low electricity costs in the country, where it is heavily subsidized.

Earlier this month, Iran's deputy energy minister suggested there was an increasing number of cryptomining units operating in Iran, with some being based in locations such as ""schools and mosques"" that receive electricity for free.

The government daily Iran reported on a cryptocurrency-mining farm in forests in the north of the country where a 35-year-old man said he had installed cryptomining rigs next to his greenhouses to take advantage of the subsidized electricity he receives for operating an agricultural site.

The New York Times reported earlier this year on a Bitcoin mining site located in the desert outside the capital, Tehran.

A report by the Chinese site 8BTC, widely cited in Iranian media, said that since late 2018 Iran had become a ""hotspot"" for Chinese miners due to its cheap electricity.

A December 2018 report by Coindesk.com quoted Nima Dehqan, a blockchain researcher at a Tehran-based crypto-startup Areatak, as saying that the firm had been meeting with foreign investors looking for cryptocurrency-mining opportunities in Iran.

""We have had investors visiting our farms from Spain, Ukraine, Armenia, and France,"" Dehqan said, adding that his firm had already signed a deal with a Spanish investor to set up mining farms in Iran.

Side-Stepping Sanctions

Reports have suggested that the U.S. sanctions that severely restrict financial and banking transfers in Iran are among the main reasons why some Iranians have been turning to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, for transactions and the related mining activities.

The blockchain technology used in digital currencies allows financial transactions to be made quickly and securely while avoiding large banks.

The United States last year pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and other world powers and announced the reimposition of crippling sanctions that has led to a shrinking economy and the collapse of the national currency, the rial.

Iranian officials have said Tehran is contemplating the launch of a state-backed cryptocurrency to facilitate financial transactions.

The head of Iran's Bitcoin Society, Mohammad Shargi, told the official government news agency IRNA that cryptocurrency mines should be supported as a way to bypass sanctions.

""Mining these currencies inside Iran will not only prevent money from leaving the country, it will also create currency under the difficult conditions of sanctions,"" Shargi was quoted as saying by IRNA earlier this month.

Shargi also suggested that cryptocurrency mining should not be entirely to blame for the surge in electricity consumption in Iran. ""We've always faced increased electricity consumption in the summer; [though] the cryptocurrency-mining farms have expanded in the country in the past two years,"" he said.

The United States has made it clear that it will crack down on Iranian businesses and economic transactions within the country, even those involving digital currencies.

In November, the U.S. Treasury Department targeted two Iranian citizens and the Bitcoin wallet addresses they had used for exchanging Bitcoin ransom payments on behalf of two hackers who, U.S. officials said, had been involved in a nearly three-year international computer-hacking and extortion scheme that affected more than 200 people and entities, including hospitals and government agencies.

""Treasury will aggressively pursue Iran and other rogue regimes attempting to exploit digital currencies,"" the department warned in 2018.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/27/how-to-buy-bitcoin.html,"Bitcoin has been on a surge, although its value did skid Thursday morning, plunging $2,000 in less than 24 hours after the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase experienced a Wednesday outage.

On Sunday, the digital currency soared above $11,000 for the first time in 15 months, climbing to $13,485.85. That's its highest price since January 2018 before a big crash in November 2018 wiped out 70% of its value and dropped the price below $4,000.

Bitcoin is highly volatile, as those figures show, and is still off its highs of about $20,000 reached in late 2017.

It's easy to buy bitcoin if you want to see what owning it is like. And if the price sounds too steep, you don't need to buy an entire bitcoin just to participate in the market. You can purchase just a small fraction of one bitcoin.

The company, funded by Medici Ventures, launched a security token trading platform last January.

The app, called the tZERO Crypto App, will also users to trade bitcoin and ethereum and includes a private key recovery system that will keep coins safe if you lose a phone or device.

“The tZERO Crypto App is a significant milestonein our plans to provide an intuitive experience for trading all digital assets,” tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi said in a statement.

The app is available for iOS and is coming to Android “soon,” according to the firm.

CoinDesk reported back in March that the firm was looking to release a crypto-buying app. At the time, Noursalehi said that the app was being developed by the team from Bitsy, a firm previously acquired by tZERO, and that in the long-term, the plan is for the app to allow trading of security tokens that are listed on tZERO’s exchange.

The firm, which grew out of e-retail giant Overstock’s efforts to develop businesses in the blockchain space, is perhaps best known for its alternative trading system (ATS) for tokens. The token platform opened in late January after years of development, though to date the only token available for trading is one issued directly by tZERO.

Meanwhile, its Medici Land Governance division is working with the World Bank and authorities in Rwanda, Liberia, Zambia, Mexico, and Teton County, Wyoming to improve land administration and securely store property records.

Overstock.com was the first major retailer to accept cryptocurrency in 2014, and CEO Patrick Byrne has continued to bet on the asset class. He explained his sale of 900,000 company shares earlier this year by saying, ""I simply had to supplement my nominal salary with stock sales in order to fulfill personal commitments to invest personally in blockchain projects"" and fulfill charity commitments.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-another-crypto-exchange-closes-due-to-regulatory-pressure,"Indian crypto exchange Koinex has ceased operations effective immediately, co-founder Rahul Raj confirmed in a blog post on June 27.

Raj said multiple delays by government agencies in clarifying crypto regulation have played a factor in the decision to close.

This month’s proposal to introduce a 10-year jail sentence for Indian citizens who use cryptocurrencies had also contributed to a “sharp decline in trading volumes.”

According to Raj, Koinex had experienced “regular disruption,” including denials when attempting to use payment services. He alleged this disruption extended to non-crypto transactions as well – with exchange employees asked questions by banks whenever they received their salary or attempted to pay their rent.

Warning that it was no longer economically feasible to serve customers, Raj added:

“The final decision has been taken after duly considering all the latest developments in the crypto and blockchain industry in India… Unfortunately we’re not too hopeful that things will change for the better in the near future.”

Raj said the exchange plans to refund frozen deposits to bank accounts over the next five weeks, and urged users to empty their crypto wallets by July 15.

In May, another Indian cryptocurrency exchange, Coinome, also announced that it was closing its doors because of regulatory difficulties.

The platform announced the breach in tweets, saying that the event was identified at around 1 a.m. local time Thursday. Users funds are insured and anyone who lost cryptocurrency would be refunded, according to the company.

The exchange said:

“First of all, please let us assure you that this situation is under control, 100% of lost funds will be returned to users, and we are reviewing our security measures and policies to ensure this does not happen again.”

Bitrue further detailed that 9.3 million XRP, worth $4.01 million, and 2.5 million cardano (ADA), worth $231,800, had been accessed and transferred off its platform.

As for how the breach occurred, the exchange explained:

“A hacker exploited a vulnerability in our Risk Control team’s 2nd review process to access the personal funds of about 90 Bitrue users. The hacker used what they learned from this breach to then access the Bitrue hot wallet and move 9.3 million XRP and 2.5 million ADA to different exchanges.”

Bitrue is working with the Huobi, Bittrex and ChangeNOW exchanges and says they have frozen funds and accounts associated with the hack.

In another tweet, Bitrue said it is conducting an emergency inspection of its systems and aims to be up and running normally again “as soon as possible.”

Early this year, Bitrue said it was also affected by a 51-percent attack on the ethereum classic cryptocurrency in which a hacker had tried to withdraw 13,000 ETC but claimed the attempted theft had been stopped by its system.

ADA is currently trading down nearly 6 percent at $0.092, while XRP is down nearly 9 percent at $0.43, according to CoinMarketCap data. It’s worth noting that the wider crypto market is generally in the red at press time.

The Apex Crypto platform allows broker-dealers and financial advisors to meet legal and regulatory guidelines by holding crypto assets in separate accounts while still offering a fast, efficient, user friendly and holistic experience. At launch, Apex Crypto is offering access to four of the most-popular coins: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Litecoin.

Both Apex Clearing and Apex Crypto are subsidiaries of PEAK6 Investments LLC, a firm that invests in and operates financial, technology and consumer companies, with a successful record of growing businesses and transforming industries.

SOURCE Apex Clearing and Apex Crypto",,https://www.wraltechwire.com/2019/06/27/bitcoin-surges-past-13000-then-falls-cryptocurrency-regulation-talk-grows/,"Bitcoin could be headed for another meteoric rise, but it’s clear the cryptocurrency hasn’t shaken the curse of volatility.

Its value surged on Wednesday, passing the $13,000 mark, before it shed about $1,000 within minutes. Around 6 pm ET, the currency was back to a $12,400-plus valuation.

The reason for the sudden midday sell off wasn’t immediately clear. But cryptocurrencies are known for price swings. A previous bitcoin craze hit a fever pitch in 2017. Bitcoin soared from just a few hundred dollars apiece in January 2017 to more than $20,000. But it came crashing down again. BItcoin’s value was still hovering around the $3,000 mark four months ago.

Experts say a weakening US dollar and fresh discussions about regulating digital currencies are fueling the latest spike in demand.

BItcoin reached a $10,000 value on Friday for the first time in more than a year. It was likely helped by an announcement from Facebook last month that the social network planned to debut its own digital currency, called Libra, introducing its 2 billion users to crypto.

Libra may hurt bitcoin’s value if it becomes the preferred choice for digital currency users. But the company’s foray into the cryptocurrency industry also renewed discussions among top economic leaders about regulating the industry, which could help legitimize alternative currencies in the eyes of consumers.

Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney both indicated they were open minded and planned to work closely with Facebook on its Libra roll out.

Nigel Green, CEO of financial consultancy firm deVere Group, also urged world leaders at the G20 summit in Japan this week to take “decisive steps” toward creating a global regulatory framework.

“It’s now high-time the leaders at the G20 summit caught up” on regulating digital currencies, Green said, according to a copy of his remarks emailed to CNN Business. “Or do they seriously think that traditional, fiat currencies are the way forward?”

Bitcoin, and other cryptos from Ethereum to Dogecoin, are not formally backed by financial institutions or governments. Every purchase and sale of a bitcoin is instead recorded on a decentralized digital ledger, using a technology called blockchain. Because transactions can be recorded anonymously, crytpocurrencies have long been associated with shady online practices, such as buying and selling illegal goods on the dark web.

But supporters from Wall Street to Silicon Valley have argued that cryptos are the future of money. They say it’s more resistant to fraud and theft. Many advocates hope regulation and more involvement from traditional banks could help win over skeptics and make cryptocurrencies a part of everyday life.",2019-06-27

Coinbase’s survey that spans the past year and 2,000 participants revealed that cryptocurrency awareness in the U.S. has continued growing, with 58% of Americans having heard about bitcoin (BTC). Of them, some expressed a desire to diversify their investment portfolios with digital currencies, were excited by crypto’s idea of a worldwide currency, or liked the absence of high transfer fees.

The top 10 states with the highest crypto ownership are California, New Jersey, Washington, New York, Colorado, Utah, Florida, Alaska, Nevada, and Massachusetts. States such as Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming have a lower overall percentage of crypto owners, but a higher per-capita ownership, meaning a smaller number of people hold a larger than average amount of crypto each.

When asked about what drove them to purchase cryptocurrency, respondents recalled the investment opportunity presented by crypto, interest in new technology, and ability to educate themselves about it among the major reasons.

One 30-year-old respondent said that “for people in my generation, I think it makes a lot more sense than stocks, bonds, inflated real estate, or other depreciating assets.”

As cryptocurrency adoption grows, regulators and policymakers worldwide have enacted legislation to address cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. Thus, as of June 2019, over 70% of U.S. states have reportedly enacted regulations pertaining to crypto or blockchain.

This year, YouTube searches for bitcoin reportedly reached their all-time high. “Americans typed ‘Bitcoin’ into Google more times last year than they searched for a range of headline-making phrases, from ‘royal wedding’ to ‘election results,’” the report states.

In late April, a survey published by Spencer Bogart of venture capital firm Blockchain Capital revealed that the vast majority of American citizens had heard of bitcoin, regardless of age. The proportion of people who heard of bitcoin increased from 77% in October 2017 to 89% in April 2019.",,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-28/bitcoin-s-rise-shows-crypto-is-alive-and-well,"Why did this happen?

On Wednesday, June 26, the price of BTC came close to reaching $14K. One hour later, it had dropped by close to 18%. Such events are known as a flash crash, a moment in time where a rapid-sell off happens and often times a few exchanges become inoperable. Over the last few years, especially when the market is extremely bullish, flash crashes have been prevalent.

The June 2019 BTC Flash Crash

The price of bitcoin core (BTC) took a dive on Wednesday after touching $13,850, dipping to $11,900 at an extremely rapid rate. In the midst of the drop, Coinbase suffered an outage and customers could not access the website. Not too long afterward, the San Francisco exchange detailed that the platform was operational again. The outage and the $1,700 flash crash was yet another reminder of the risks assumed when people use centralized trading platforms. Cryptocurrency traders have dealt with flash crashes a lot over the years and it’s safe to assume there will be more in the future. In order to understand these events, news.Bitcoin.com has collected data on some of the biggest crypto flash crashes of our time.

Flash Crashes Have Plagued Crypto Traders Since 2011

Mt. Gox June 19, 2011 and April 10, 2013

One of the first big flash crashes was in 2011 when BTC was trading for $2 per unit on Mt. Gox before suddenly creeping up to $32 per coin. At the time, bitcoiners celebrated the fact that BTC met parity with 1 ounce of 0.999 fine silver. However, on June 19, 2011, there was a large flash crash on Mt. Gox which saw the price plummet from $17 to $0.01 in a matter of no time. The sell-off was initiated by the announcement that Mt. Gox had been hacked. The Mt. Gox website was also inoperable at the time and customers could not access their funds. The exchange reopened that Sunday at 10 p.m. EST and not long after, most bitcoiners forgot about the incident.

Another crash that took place in the spring of 2013 saw BTC prices tumble from $266 to $100 in a few hours. At the time, BTC prices were extremely bullish, rising from just $13 in January to over $200 during the start of the spring. The crash took place on Wednesday, April 10, 2013, and during the downswing, Mt. Gox customers complained of login issues and extreme lag using the trading engine. Some trades allegedly took more than 70 minutes to process according to Vitalik Buterin’s recount of the day. The community assumed Mt. Gox was suffering from a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS attack) but Mt. Gox told clients it wasn’t a DDoS and said the lag was due to “high volume trades.” Another Mt. Gox tweet that followed said: “Network maintenance, don’t freak out!”

Btc.e Exchange, February 10, 2014

The now-defunct Btc.e exchange was a popular and long-running trading platform during the earlier years of crypto. On Monday, February 10, 2014, traders on the exchange watched the price of BTC drop from $620 to $102 in a matter of seconds. According to reports, the price of BTC bounced right back on the exchange two minutes later. “The crash is the result of what appears to be a single person selling at least 6,000 bitcoins significantly below the market price,” explains the Bitcoin Wiki page en.bitcoin.it/wiki. The crash record notes that the motivation behind the sale was a “subject of debate” and “the sale was made with apparently extreme loss.”

Bitfinex August 19, 2015 and November 29, 2017

In the summer of 2015, the price of BTC dropped 29% on Bitfinex in roughly a 30-minute period. The entire global average took a 14% hit that day, but on Wednesday, August 19, 2015, BTC prices dipped from $255 to $179.35 on the exchange. At that time, Bitfinex was one of the most liquid bitcoin trading platforms by volume and told the media the crash was “triggered by several leveraged positions.” Bitfinex executive Phil Potter explained in an interview that the exchange dealt with “technical difficulties” and “lag in its live engine.”

On November 29, 2017, Bitfinex had multiple flash crashes as the prices of NEO, OMG, and ETP reportedly lost more than 90% of value in minutes. At the time, Bitcoin futures had just been announced and the price of BTC was rallying toward $10k. The same day, BTC’s price corrected by 20% and Sam Aiken wrote a blog post on Medium describing how he lost a great deal of money. Aiken said the price of ETP instantly fell from $3.50 to $0.05, triggering stop-losses and liquidations. “A bit later ETP will fall down again from $2.7 to $1.00 and jump right back — After that NEO fell down from $33 to $4,” Aiken declared.

GDAX/Coinbase, June 21, 2017

Ethereum traders were shocked to see the price of ETH fall from $319 per coin to as low as $0.10 on the GDAX exchange, which is now called Coinbase Pro. The flash crash was blamed on a “multimillion-dollar market sell order.” Reports state that when the price of ETH dropped more than 800%, stop loss orders and margin trade liquidations took place. Coinbase vice president Adam White explained that “some customers did not receive the quality of service we strive to provide and we want to do better.” White revealed that the San Francisco-based company would reimburse traders after the flash crash. “For customers who had buy orders filled — we are honoring all executed orders and no trades will be reversed. For affected customers who had margin calls or stop-loss orders executed – we are crediting you using company funds.”

Kraken May 7, 2017 and May 29, 2019

The price of BTC to Canadian dollars (CAD) dropped on Kraken exchange from $11,200 to $101 on May 29, 2019. The drop was over 99% but it lasted only a minute or so before the price stabilized. Years prior on May 7, 2017, ethereum traders saw the price of ETH/USD plummet from a high of $98 per ETH to $26 a coin which triggered a cascade of margin liquidations. Kraken revealed that despite the fact there was a DDoS attack “the liquidations had been triggered and they could not be stopped – DDoS or not.” “The DDoS did neither cause nor exacerbate liquidations,” Kraken added. “[If Kraken should have halted trading while under attack] the consequences for traders would have been even worse.”

Poloniex, May 26, 2019

Poloniex, a subsidiary of Circle Financial, had a flash crash on May 26, 2019, when the price of clams (CLAM) plummeted. Reports state that margin traders saw the price of clams lose 77% in value in less than an hour. Poloniex revealed that the platform’s margin lending pool took a loss of $13.5 million thanks to a burst of liquidations. “The velocity of the crash and the lack of liquidity in the CLAM market made it impossible for all of the automatic liquidations of CLAM margin positions to process as they normally would in a liquid market,” Poloniex told customers. “Lenders impacted will see the reduction in their accounts when they next log in,” the exchange added.

Trade Safely: Flash Crashes Can Happen at Any Time

The flash crash last Wednesday is a good reminder that cryptocurrency markets are still very much prone to these incidents. It also should give large trading platforms a kick in the ass to prepare for large waves of users if 2019 is anything like 2017. Exchanges had more than a year to prepare for the next bull run and heavier usage. Traders who keep funds on exchanges should be aware that flash crashes could happen at any time and there may be a chance they cannot access funds when they need to trade. People should never put down more than they are willing to lose on a centralized trading platform.

Bitcoin is still on track to close with gains for the fifth straight month, despite having witnessed a double-digit technical correction in the last 36 hours.

The hourly chart shows the pullback has ended and prices could revisit recent highs over the weekend.

With a reward halving due in May 2020 and increased institutional participation, prices could rise further in the second half of this year.

A break below the May 30 high of $9,097 would invalidate the bullish outlook as per the daily chart.

While bitcoin’s price has witnessed a double-digit correction in the last 36 hours, the cryptocurrency is still on track to end in the green for the fifth consecutive month.

The price of a single bitcoin fell to $10,300 on Bitstamp yesterday, retracing 55 percent of the rally from the June 4 low of $7,432 to the June 26 high of $13,880.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,800, down 15 percent from recent highs. However, despite the correction, the top cryptocurrency is still up 38 percent from its June 1 opening price of $8,546.

With the monthly close just two days away and technical studies reporting bullish conditions, BTC is likely to end June on a positive note.

The resulting five-month winning run will be the longest since August 2017, as seen in the chart below.

Monthly chart

Bitcoin is flashing green for the fifth month straight, having rallied by 11, 8, 28, and 62 percent in February, March, April and May, respectively.

A similar winning streak was observed in five months to August 2017.

The cryptocurrency appears on track to log double-digit price gains for the third consecutive month – the first such run since the final quarter of 2017.

What’s more, bitcoin is set to post a record second-quarter gain of over 180 percent, as discussed earlier this week.

The stellar run could be extended in the second half of this year, as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving sometime in May 2020.

Further, some observers including Anthony Popliano, co-founder and partner of Morgan Creek Digital, believe the rally seen in the first half was backed by institutional money and the inflows may rise further in the future, thus keeping BTC better bid.

Meanwhile, Marc Bhargava of tagomi.com, the first electronic prime brokerage in cryptocurrency markets, believes this year’s rally is the product of both retail and institutional money.

While talking to CoinDeskLIVE, Bhargava said the 2017 rally was almost entirely driven by retail money, while the one seen this year has been more balanced, with an approximately 80:20 ratio of retail to institutional money.

Bhargava, however, cited low trading volumes as a cause for concern and stressed the need for increased adoption by large asset managers for further price gains.

That said, there seems to be a consensus in the market that Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency will end up boosting bitcoin’s appeal as an anti-establishment asset and thus its adoption rate.

All-in-all, the macros seem aligned in favor of the continuation of the price rise in the second half of this year. The long-term technical charts are also flashing bullish signals.

Meanwhile, the intraday charts indicate the pullback has ended and recent highs could come into play over the weekend.

Hourly and daily charts

The hourly chart (above left) shows that the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the descending trendline, invalidating the bearish divergence (lower-highs pattern) established earlier this week.

Further, the chart is reporting a bearish channel breakout. As a result, BTC could rise back to levels above $13,000 over the weekend.

Supporting the bullish case is that the cryptocurrency repeatedly bounced from the bullish (ascending) 10-day moving average on the daily chart (above right).

The outlook on that time frame will remain bullish as long as the price is held above the May 30 high of $9,097.

Weekly and monthly charts

Prices may come under pressure next month as the weekly RSI (above left) is reporting extreme overbought conditions, with the highest reading since January 2018.

Any price dip, however, will likely be short-lived, as a channel breakout and a bullish crossover of the 5- and 10-month MAs on the monthly chart (above right) may to have opened the doors for a rally to record highs above $20,000.

Contrary to popular belief, Facebook’s planned cryptocurrency, Libra, probably isn’t the only thing behind bitcoin’s recent resurgence.

Although crypto speculation surely increased after the social media giant’s announcement, bitcoin’s recent rise might also have something to do with another digital token, Tether, a US dollar-pegged unit commonly used to trade bitcoin on exchanges that lack banking partners. Tether is issued and redeemed by a company of the same name.

In the past few weeks, bitcoin has nearly doubled in price, jumping from $7,000 to more than $13,000. At the time of writing, the exuberance has tapered off somewhat, with the cryptocurrency trading around $11,700. At the beginning of the year, bitcoin traded for just under $4,000.

Bitcoin’s recent rise appears to coincide with the creation of new Tether tokens. The market cap for the token, called USDT, has similarly grown in recent weeks. Some crypto analysts suspect Tether (the company) is creating USDT not fully backed by dollars and using it to buy bitcoin, driving up its price, through Bitfinex, an affiliate exchange. (The companies deny this.)

Both Tether and Bitfinex are subsidiaries of iFinex, which has struggled to find banks willing to take its business; iFinex did not respond to a request for comment.

Tether was linked to bitcoin price manipulation last June in a paper by researchers at the University of Texas. In April, The New York attorney general’s office announced that it was investigating iFinex for fraud.

Also in April, Tether’s attorney revealed that USDT tokens are only backed 74% by reserves. In other words, the digital tokens, which are meant to be worth $1 apiece, would have only $0.74 of redeemable value if all were converted at once.

Nouriel Roubini, an NYU economist and longtime bitcoin skeptic, mentioned Tether as one factor in what he called “crypto b/s.” He pointed to the University of Texas study suggesting that 95% of bitcoin volume is fabricated, meaning that a person—or group—trades tokens between themselves. Others in the crypto community echoed Roubini’s doubts, including Nicholas Weaver, a networking researcher at the University of California at Berkeley:

The bitcoin market can sometimes feel chaotic and incomprehensible, but there are often fundamental drivers behind the cryptocurrency’s price. This week, Libra is clearly a factor—but Tether may be the one worth scrutinizing.",,https://www.coindesk.com/irish-crypto-exchange-bitsane-may-have-disappeared-with-users-funds,"Irish cryptocurrency exchange Bitsane may have done a runner with users’ funds.

Forbes said Thursday that the Bitsane exchange, which offers spot trading of cryptos and gained popularity as an early provider of XRP trading, has gone offline and has deleted its social media accounts. Emails sent by Forbes bounced back, it said.

Customers of the exchange are saying that they have possibly lost amounts ranging from $5,000 to $150,000 in crypto holdings.

On crypto data website CoinMarketCap, Bitsane’s trading information has not been updated for over 10 days.

A user that claimed to have lost $150,000 and requested to remain anonymous told Forbes:

“I was trying to transfer XRP out to bitcoin or cash or anything, and it kept saying ‘temporarily disabled.’ I knew right away there was some kind of problem. I went back in to try to look at those tickets to see if they were still pending, and you could no longer access Bitsane.”

Launched in 2016, Bitsane was registered in Ireland as Bitsane LP, with Aidas Rupsys listed as CEO and Dmitry Prudnikov as CTO. Forbes says Prudnikov’s LinkedIn account has now also been deleted, and that both could not be reached for comment.

Some users apparently suspect that another firm, Bitsane Limited, which was founded by Maksim Zmitrovich, may be connected to the possible exit scam. Forbes did manage to speak to Zmitrovich, but he denied any involvement and said he hadn’t spoken to Prudnikov in over five months.

As far as other top cryptocurrencies are concerned, Chainlink (LINK), the 19th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is showing a massive 26% gain on the day. Coinbase Pro announced support for the smart contract token just yesterday, June 27, and has just recently announced full trading support for the LINK/ETH pair.

Total market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies is currently $311.7 billion, according to the data on Coin360’s summary table.

Regarding the overall state of the cryptocurrency market, analysts have suggested that the recent correction in the crypto market is still consistent with forecasts of a so-called parabolic bull run. Robert Sluymer, managing director and technical strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is quoted as telling clients:

“A 20%-30% pullback would not be surprising and very consistent with bitcoin’s recent bull-market pullbacks.”

Meanwhile in traditional markets, gold is trending up slightly after seeing a major crash on Wednesday and Thursday, like bitcoin, according to data provided by MarketWatch.

Following the June 27 action, a spokesman for the Energy Ministry said cryptocurrency mining operations were destabilizing the power grid and affecting electrical access for households and businesses. He warned that the government will continue to pursue mining operations, which have proliferated in recent years.

Electrical consumption in the country has spiked 7 percent, according to the minister, who also said the power used for mining one coin equaled the energy used by 24 residential units for an entire year.

Electricity is heavily subsidized in Iran, so the costs of running a crypto mining farm are cheap – as low as $0.006 per kilowatt-hour. Tehran-based crypto startup Areatak was previously reported to be hunting for foreign capital to establish crypto mining sites across Iran, though the practice is illegal.

Chinese firms, too, have set up facilities in Iran, bucking their home country’s image as a crypto mining hub.

The Iranian government is considering setting a special price for the power used by crypto miners, proposed by the Energy Ministry. Though in his speech yesterday, the spokesman suggested that some crypto miners may be locating their power-hungry rigs in schools and mosques to avoid paying utility bills.

Safe haven?

A shrinking economy and the devaluation of the Iranian real have reportedly spurred citizens to seek sanctuary in cryptocurrencies.

“Mining these currencies inside Iran will not only prevent money from leaving the country, it will also create currency under the difficult conditions of sanctions,” Mohammad Shargi, head of Iran’s Bitcoin Society, was quoted as saying by IRNA earlier this month.

He also suggested some Iranians could use cryptos as a means to bypass and subvert the strict sanctions imposed by the U.S., following its withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal last May.

Earlier this year the Central Bank of Iran – which had previously placed capital flight controls on cryptos – published a draft framework on the legality of cryptocurrency.

Paying or getting paid with digital coins is the norm in the cryptocurrency sector. Participants in many other industries, however, may also be tempted to take advantage of the benefits offered by decentralized currencies. In the case of bitcoin cash (BCH), that means fast, secure and low-cost transactions. Some platforms facilitate crypto payments between companies and their employees, while peer-to-peer settlements remain a viable option as well.

Crypto Payroll Services Offered

Businesses exploring the possibility of introducing crypto payments for their employees and contractors may need the help of companies that specialize in this type of accounting. Bitwage is a well-established platform that provides payroll and human resource services for this day and age, when the use of digital currencies in payments is growing rapidly around the world.

Bitwage helps international companies pay their vendors faster and cheaper using crypto. Many of its clients are employers who want to offer their workers and contractors benefits associated with digital assets. At the same time, it provides individuals who would like to get paid with coins the option to receive some or all of their salary in cryptocurrency.

The platform, which has offices on both sides of the Atlantic and customers from Brazil to India, is working with businesses that need extensive payroll and HR services. It offers a wide range of flexible solutions and pricing to both employers and employees. For payroll funding, Bitwage currently supports bitcoin core (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) as well as multiple fiat currencies including U.S. dollar, Chinese yuan, Russian ruble, and euro.

Once Bitwage receives the funds, workers can choose to be paid in either cryptocurrency or local fiat. In the United States, it also gives companies the option to settle payroll taxes in crypto through a partnership with another American company, Simply Efficient HR. Since January, Bitwage clients in the U.S. have also been able to cover employee benefits such as health insurance. Tax obligations related to cryptocurrency income vary between jurisdictions and taxpayers should check their local regulations.

The establishment and advancement of other platforms providing payroll services is likely to entice even more businesses, especially those employing remote workers, to start paying wages in cryptocurrency. For now, Bitwage doesn’t have too many competitors at the same level but there are others with interesting proposals. For example, an employment service called Laborx has set out to cut banks and redefine salaries by facilitating real-time remuneration using cryptocurrency.

In its vision of what payroll management should look like, the Australian startup considers the current monthly and weekly payment arrangements outdated and allows companies to pay their employees as they work. At the end or even during the working day, employees will be able to spend what they’ve just earned. When the instant payment system was announced last year, it was meant only for members of Laborx’s hiring ecosystem using its Labour-Hour tokens. However, decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash can be used for the same purpose, as BCH transfers often cost less than a U.S. cent.

Paying Directly With Bitcoin

Many companies from the crypto industry often prefer to fund their entire payroll with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin cash is the coin of choice in the case of Bitcoin.com for its obvious advantages over other digital currencies, including fast and safe transactions processed at a negligible cost.

No third party services are needed to implement such payments. All your employees and contractors would need is a secure and easy to use crypto wallet app. The Bitcoin.com Wallet is available for free on the App Store and Google Play. And for desktop applications you can try out the Badger wallet.

With the wallet, you can make and receive payments to and from any bitcoin cash and bitcoin core address and Badger has some useful features. One of them is the integration of an exchange service called Sideshift, which will let you swap BTC and BCH at very low cost and you’ll receive the exchanged amount directly in your wallet. You can also purchase coins with a credit card and without visiting an exchange.

But even if you work with people from countries where smartphones are rarer and internet connection is not as reliable, you can still pay them with bitcoin cash. Cointext is a platform that facilitates offline crypto transactions. The platform enables users to transfer BCH using simple text messages.

Create and Send Crypto Invoices

Invoicing is an important part of day-to-day business relations between companies and contractors. Multiple platforms now offer accounting services for businesses and professionals in the crypto space and beyond, including tools that will help you create and send cryptocurrency invoices like Gilded, Anypay, Blockonomics, CD Pay, and Coinpayments.

At the same time, platforms such as Piixpay allow you to pay bills and invoices with digital assets, including bitcoin cash, to entities that still accept only fiat money. To do so takes only a few steps before sending the electronic cash, like providing the exact amount in fiat currency, the recipient’s name and their bank account number.

The expansion of all these services has allowed many companies, and not only those operating within the crypto industry, to start paying wages, bonuses and other remuneration partially or fully using cryptocurrencies. For instance, platforms such as Openbazaar, Augur, Uber and Airbnb are among Bitwage’s clients.

Others have introduced arrangements allowing part of the salary payments to be made in crypto. Japanese internet giant GMO implemented such a system early last year. And in May 2019, in response to Peter Schiff’s claim that “there is no way people are going to work for salaries paid in bitcoin,” crypto exchange Kraken revealed it just paid over a quarter of its employees in cryptocurrency.

Finding a Job Paid With Cryptocurrency

Technological advances, including the spread of cryptocurrencies, have made the world smaller and the importance of freelancing grows with every passing year. A study released in 2017 predicted that freelancers will form the majority of the workforce in the United States within a decade. Remote jobs are a phenomenon that’s rapidly gaining traction globally as well.

Right now, cryptocurrency is as close to a frictionless, borderless means of payment as possible. It can serve the expanding freelancing space very well. A survey exploring the payment preferences of freelancers in the U.S., conducted by Humans.net in 2018, showed that almost a third of the respondents would like to be paid partially or entirely with crypto.

If you are a freelancer looking for employment in the crypto industry and you want to be paid with cryptocurrency, there’s a bunch of online platforms that can help you find the job you want. Check out, for example, sites like Crypto Jobs List, Angel List, Peopleperhour, Moneo, Hire Match, Blocklancer, and Bitjob.

Workingforbitcoins is another option that gives the opportunity to connect with businesses hiring people for crypto. The platform supports major currencies such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and will let you pick a job paid with your favorite coin. You can also find thousands of job ads offering crypto remuneration on Crypto.jobs and a service called Freelance for Coins enables users to place offers and bids for freelance services.

Unschooling is an alternative education movement quickly gaining popularity and currency worldwide. Like Bitcoin, it is an individualist approach to an area of human action long thought to be established beyond question―education. Both cryptoeconomics and unschooling seek to provide autonomy to individuals, providing a return to logical, natural systems that value human life.

What Is Unschooling?

Unschooling is a buzzword popping up in random conversations, hashtagged heavily on social media, and a source of bewilderment for those who may know what ‘homeschooling’ is, but have never heard of this sister term. Unschooling. Unlearning. These sound on the surface like steps backward from the goals of centralized, compulsory education. And they are.

The oft-misunderstood term was coined by late U.S. school teacher-turned-unschooling advocate John Holt. In 1964 Holt wrote How Children Fail, whose outlined methodologies and observations would ultimately cost him his job―and bring him to the forefront of the unschooling movement. Holt’s legacy can be summed up in part by his brief observation:

“Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the product of the activity of learners.”

Unschooling Meets Crypto-Anarchy

At the time of writing, the Homeschooling Global Summit (June 17-29) is well underway. It’s an online event featuring 20+ homeschooling and unschooling advocates, speakers, and teachers. Some on the roster include Sir Ken Robinson, psychologist and founder of the Alliance for Self-Directed Education, Peter Gray, and Didi Taihuttu, “The Bitcoin Family” dad. Taihuttu sold most of his belongings back in 2017 to get into Bitcoin. Why?

I started to question the materialistic life, the economical system and the schooling of our kids and as a family we decided we needed to change and we did.

While Taihutti’s story is certainly one of the more visible examples, there are many others beside him choosing to live “outside the system” in some way or another, with crypto as a tool facilitating this. It affords flexibility. These are living examples of decentralized money and self-directed learning in action. And human action is ultimately what this all comes down to.

Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises wrote something similar to John Holt on learning, except regarding market action, noting in Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis: “All rational action is in the first place individual action. Only the individual thinks. Only the individual reasons. Only the individual acts.”

Holt and Mises were talking about the same reality, just applied to different―albeit overlapping and inextricably integrated―areas of human action. Both unschooling and Austrian economic principles stem from a sound understanding of property and individual self-ownership. An individual member of a group is still an individual without the abstraction called the “group.” The corollary does not hold true, however. A group without individuals is absolutely nothing. Only individual humans learn, and only individual market actors act.

A lot has changed since 2009. Like trendy talk about unschooling, though the concept of decentralization was not new when it began to gain social traction thanks to Bitcoin. The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto had already called it, loud and clear, way back in 1988:

“Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other.”

The manifesto goes on make many more prescient observations, an important reminder that the current evolution taking hold has been in the works for a long time.

The Roof Is on Fire, Send Gasoline

What can now be seen in state-sanctioned finance and education is an attempt to put out a “fire” from the inside of a collapsing, burning building―and to do so, moreover, with even more fire and gasoline. The “solution” being implemented is to the tune of billions in taxpayer dollars each year. Both state-sanctioned systems are failing miserably; failing the individuals forced to pay for them, in ways too numerous to name.

In education, this failure is evidenced by declining academic performance, arrest of elementary school students, physically and sexually abusive teachers, and of course the taking by force of 12 of the most important years of one’s life, not to mention repeated, blatant instances of direct kidnapping. Take Sweden, where individuals must run from the law or hide, with almost zero chance at exemption, just to choose the type of education their child receives. In the U.S, CPS kidnappings have become a real problem as well.

Where financial institutions are concerned, euphemized theft, gross fiscal irresponsibility, and outright violence against non-violent market actors abound. The question to be asked here is not how to put out the fire, but why the buildings are allowed to stand in the first place.

Human Nodes – Keys to the Kingdom

Flash-triggered, massive, avalanche-style decentralization of information followed the advent of the internet. The advent of Bitcoin and blockchain―this time the decentralization of trade and monetary systems―will continue to have similar implications of equally profound, if not greater, importance. Uber, Spotify, Airbnb and others are decentralizing legacy business models, giving customers the keys to their platforms, leveraging their userbases to do much of the heavy lifting for them. The “decentralize everything” trend is catching on. In just under 10 years the simple concept of Airbnb has enjoyed a 153% global compound growth rate. Uber has grown to 3 million drivers and 75 million riders making it a $72B company.

Signals from decentralized human “nodes” using platforms like Uber and others provide “boots on the ground” market data to business owners. Millions of engaged, independent users can relay much more about customer preference, market trends, and regional supply and demand cues than any board of directors in some remote high-rise ever could.

The more independent nodes, the more robust the network. It’s true for Bitcoin. It’s true for Uber and similar models. It should come as no surprise then, that it’s true in education as well. The more market options and opportunities for unschooling, community groups, student-led learning centers etc, the higher the quality of life for individuals set to do the learning.

A Return to Nature

The unschooling movement seeks the decentralization of education, and is an abandonment of centralized, authoritarian models. Where Montessori, charter schools, and state curriculum-based homeschooling might be the “Uber” and “Spotify,” forming quasi-decentralized legacy models of education, unschooling is far more radical.

It affords learners complete freedom to choose their own educational path, just as blockchains do not tell one how, why, where, or when to transact. Market actors know how they want to transact already, without coercive oversight to “help.” The same holds true in learning. Nature knows what it needs and wants to do. After all, if humans can become conversational in difficult languages like Mandarin or English in just the first three years of life, with no teachers, textbooks, or schools, why do some imagine that without this building called “school” no learning can take place?

The crypto and unschooling movements are a return to natural, logical systems, and the rejection of dysfunctional, illogical, and unsustainable ones. Unschooling is just another piece of the puzzle, where individual self-ownership and property intersect with learning and child development. As such, crypto enthusiasts are understandably interested in learning more.

The account is part of a larger trend, where people leverage the open nature of the blockchain to troll each other, watch trends, and see where the money is moving.

Bot accounts have become an important part of this space, since they automatically publish important events.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .

If you're not a cryptocurrency expert, it's hard to tell what the tweets mean.

""Liquidated long on XBTUSD,"" a recent one reads. ""Sell 13,480 @ 11861 ~ Multi kill.""

The tweet is from an account called REKT, an unofficial bot that tracks when users lose a ton of money on the popular Bitmex cryptocurrency exchange and tweets it out. The name ""REKT"" is an in-joke among gamers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alike, used when you get ""wrecked"" by an unfortunate turn of events.

A major virtue of cryptocurrency is that everybody can see the underlying blockchain, meaning it's impossible to fake or forge a transaction - a record of the money move is right there, permanent and ""immutable,"" in blockchain parlance. So while each individual user is anonymous, it's possible to see when a bad decision was made and somebody took a bath.

The REKT account is part schadenfreude, part warning: trading cryptocurrency is risky, and people can lose massive sums of money. On Bitmex, the risk is even higher since people are able to trade on margin, meaning they can borrow money from the exchange by putting down a bit of collateral.

If things go well, they stand to make a bunch of money - if the price of the token of choice goes up, they pocket the difference, less the loan they took from Bitmex. If the market turns against them, however, Bitmex can liquidate their position, keeping whatever collateral they put down and potentially even putting them in debt.

To add insult to injury, REKT automatically tweets out how much those users lost, along with funny phrases and emojis that indicate just how bad the loss was.

This tweet in particular meant that the user ""went long"" on a trade, buying the coin with the expectation to hang on and sell it later at a higher price. When the price dropped, Bitmex automatically cashed the user out - at a lower price than they originally bought it for.

Another bot account called Whale Alert, tracks the movement of large sums of bitcoin. Its tweets show large sums of money passing from one account to another, and eventually ending up on an exchange. As a complement to REKT, Whale Alert shows the massive sums of cryptocurrency that are moving around the whole ecosystem.

Even with the fortunes made and lost here, people seem to enjoy the spectacle: The REKT account has almost 46,000 followers, while Whale Alert is nearing 98,000.

One follower - prominent cryptocurrency trader Jacob Canfield - says the cryptocurrency community on Twitter - bots and all - is an important resource for traders and investors alike as a way to see how the market is moving.

""If you're going to be an active member in the space, Twitter is an absolute must so you watch things happening in real time,"" he said.

Canfield is a full-time cryptocurrency investor and has an active Twitter following of his own. A former pharmaceutical trader, he became a ""crypto influencer"" by warning people about cryptocurrency scams.

Today, Canfield runs Signal Profits ,where he gives trading advice and predictions to followers on Twitter, Discord, and YouTube.

""It's evolved dramatically,"" he explained. ""Due to the level of novice-ness coming in, I had to drastically change my approach. Most setups I give now are as safe as possible.""

Bankers, government officials, and regulators all over the world are feeling increasingly alarmed by the disruptive capabilities of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Facebook’s recently launched “cryptocurrency”, Libra, is the latest cause of fury, angst, and fear amongst regulatory bodies.

Regulators Concerned Over Crypto Growth

Threatened by the growing adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, governments and bankers are asking for more regulations and stricter scrutiny over crypto assets.

Especially, after Facebook’s announcement of plans to issue their digital coin Libra, lawmakers and regulators around the world immediately expressed concerns regarding the social media giant’s caprice and irresponsibility in handling user data.

The rising popularity of cryptocurrencies has forced key European leaders, such as French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, and German conservative MEP Markus Ferber, to make urgent calls to regulate and control cryptocurrencies. Le Maire actually intends to form a task force for the G7 countries to investigate digital currencies.

More Control, More Vigilance, More Oversight

Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), believes that innovations like crypto-assets may challenge any regulatory framework.

Thus, he has been asking regulators across the world to exercise more stringent controls over the use of Bitcoin and other crypto assets for retail payments. On June 25, 2019, addressing G20 leaders in Osaka regarding the topic of how to contain the risks of financial innovation, Quarles said,

“One example is crypto-assets. A wider use of new types of crypto-assets for retail payment purposes would warrant close scrutiny by authorities to ensure that that they are subject to high standards of regulation. The FSB and standard-setting bodies will monitor risks very closely and in a coordinated fashion, and consider additional multilateral responses as needed.”

Unlike Bitcoin, Facebook is a corporation, and it will have to withstand strict reviews from numerous interested parties. Reuters writes,

”Besides central banks, markets regulators, consumer protection watchdogs, and agencies that tackle money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes, Facebook’s payment network might also have to adhere to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures that are set by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Organization of Securities Commissions.”

Unnecessary “Watchdog” Intervention Impeding Adoption

Ignorance is one of the main causes of fear. Many government officials simply do not know how crypto assets work and what their impact could be on the financial markets.

Authorities in Singapore, for example, foresee significant hurdles that will make things difficult for Libra. In effect, Ravi Menon, Managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, is concerned about the Facebook virtual currency project.

According to Bloomberg, although acknowledging that cross-border transactions are “expensive, inefficient, and sometimes risky,” Menon could foresee Libra’s potential benefits. However, he said,

“The key challenge is to figure out the nature of the beast. What is it more like and which box we can put into? At this point, we are not sure.”

How do you think the advent of Facebook’s Libra will affect Bitcoin in terms of regulatory scrutiny? Let us know your comments below.

Texas Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles has entered three emergency cease and desist orders against promoters of fraudulent cryptocurrency-related investments who are soliciting Texas residents through Facebook “work from home” forums.

The orders stem from an initiative undertaken by the Enforcement Division of the State Securities Board, which last week started an investigative sweep of suspect cryptocurrency offerings after the price of Bitcoin more than doubled in the past three months. This marks the Enforcement Division’s second regulatory sweep of cryptocurrency investment offerings.

The first such initiative commenced in December 2017 and also followed a steep increase in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The first sweep led to 10 emergency injunctive actions against promoters illegally or fraudulently offering securities tied to cryptocurrencies in Texas. To date, the State Securities Board has taken emergency action against 61 parties in 22 administrative cases involving investments related to cryptocurrencies.

The three individuals and one company named in the June 28 orders are recruiting potential investors through advertisements on public Facebook groups for Texans working from home or interested in doing so. People who respond to the Facebook ads are being directed to contact the investment promoters through Facebook-owned WhatsApp, an encrypted instant-messaging platform.

Two of the promoters – Mikhail Rania Safiya of London, and Madeline O’Farrell, who lists an address in Belize – are promising investors they can earn lucrative profits for them by trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and foreign currencies. Both promoters are reaching potential investors through ads on the Facebook Group titled “Work From Home | Earn Money Online | San Antonio Texas.”

Neither Safiya nor O’Farrell are registered to sell securities, according to the orders, and both are intentionally failing to disclose the risks of trading cryptocurrencies, foreign currencies, and other products.

Safiya, according to the order, is directing potential investors to an online platform that supposedly allows for the trading of bitcoin and foreign currencies. Safiya is encouraging potential investors to create an account on the platform and fund it with bitcoin.

According to order, Safiya is telling investors she will access their bitcoin on the platform and trade their principal for a profit, taking 20% of the profits as her payment. Safiya is informing investors they must disclose their login credentials to her, which gives her access to their bitcoin and the ability to transfer it to a digital wallet she controls.

The third order alleges that India-based Tint X Mining is fraudulently offering Texas investors the opportunity to earn lucrative returns through bitcoin mining. The company and a promoter, Maxi Samantha Fortune, are recruiting potential investors through ads on the public Facebook Group titled “Texas Work From Home.”

Tint X Mining is telling investors they can earn $213,300 over three months on an initial investment of $5,100 in the company’s bitcoin mining operation.

The order states that Tint X Mining is falsely claiming it is a licensed firm. The company is also not disclosing any of the risks in mining cryptocurrencies, nor is it providing any information about its expertise or track record in bitcoin mining.",2019-06-29 17:21:11+03:00,,,,,,

Bitcoin is back! Year-to-date, the price of the digital currency is up by more than 200%, and people are taking notice. Bitcoin Google search volumes are up, brokers are advertising their crypto offerings again, scammers are coming back, and first-time buyers are knocking on the doors of exchanges.

To help crypto newcomers avoid classic beginner’s mistakes, we have compiled a list of the top twelve do’s and don’ts of investing in bitcoin.

Educate yourself about crypto before you invest

Before you purchase any digital asset, conduct thorough research on what you intend to buy. As the old investing adage goes, “don’t invest in what you don’t understand.”

It is essential to educate yourself about how the blockchain and cryptocurrencies work as well as the differences between the most popular digital assets. That way, you will understand the current and potential future value of each coin and token you are considering buying.

6 Essential Steps Before Investing in Cryptocurrency

Only use reputable exchanges

There are multiple ways to acquire digital assets. Once you know which assets you want to buy and you want to use an online exchange it is important to only transact on reputable, secure platforms.

There are hundreds of bitcoin and altcoin exchanges but only a handful of them regulated. The majority of exchanges do not provide much transparency as to how they operate, how well they are funded or how they handle their cybersecurity. Dealing on small, overseas exchanges that operate under little regulatory oversight can lead to an unexpected loss of funds due to an operational error, an exchange hack or an exit scam. Unfortunately, all these things have happened in the past, which makes a strong argument for only dealing on reputable trading platforms. However, even those might be hacked.

Securely store your digital asset holdings

As soon as you have purchased bitcoin and/or other digital assets, it is imperative to store your holdings in a secure personal wallet. There are a wide array of wallets to choose from, but hardware wallets, such as Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey and BitLox, are generally considered the most secure for long-term investors.

Invest only as much as you can afford to lose

It is also important to note that when it comes to investing in digital assets like bitcoin, you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.

While bitcoin is on the rise and many experts believe we will see it surpass its previous highs sooner than later, the reality is that bitcoin is a volatile asset that can easily lose 50% of its value in a short period of time. Hence, experts agree that it is best to only commit a small percentage of one’s overall investment portfolio to digital assets if you want to invest in the asset class.

Don’t let the volatility spook you

Bitcoin and digital assets are volatile investments. The price of bitcoin can easily go up or down ten percent in a matter of days (if not hours), so it is important to keep your cool as a crypto investor. Remember, this is not the stock market. Crypto experiences much bigger intra-day price swings and that’s ok.

If the volatility is making you nervous, maybe you are better off not checking the value of your digital asset portfolio daily.

Don’t leave your funds on exchanges

Exchange hacks are, unfortunately, still a widespread occurrence in the cryptoasset markets. Even one of the market-leaders, Binance has not been immune from cyber attacks. Hence, it is imperative to transfer your digital asset holdings off exchanges and into your personal wallet(s) as soon as you have executed your trades.

If an exchange is hacked and your funds are affected, it can take weeks to get your funds back (provided the exchange will pay for the security breach) or you will lose all your funds with little to no legal recourse to recuperate them.

Don’t listen to what mainstream media says about Bitcoin

Mainstream media has claimed that Bitcoin has died over 300 times. At the same time, mainstream media loves to report about bitcoin when the price is skyrocketing as it drives views and clicks from interested investors.

Generally speaking, you should be very cautious towards mainstream media when it comes to any sort of financial advice. The same also holds true for investment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, choose your crypto media sources very carefully, also, as the space is known for unprofessional reporting, biases and hidden paid articles.

Don’t fall for a scam

Unfortunately, with the rise in the price of bitcoin, the scammers are coming back into the market as well. There are a number of different crypto scams to look out for but when it comes to investment scams, the simple rule “if it looks too good to be true, it probably is” generally holds true. Avoid investing in any type of investment plans or schemes as they will likely turn out to be nothing more than Ponzi schemes. Instead, buy and hold the assets you want to buy directly if you want exposure to bitcoin and co.

5 Crypto Scams To Be Aware Of

Don’t take part in pump and dump schemes/groups

Pump and dump groups are very common in the crypto markets as it is easy to manipulate the price of small-cap coins and tokens that see very little trading volumes. It may seem enticing to join these groups/schemes but aside from the fact that these operations are illegal, you will also likely lose out as someone who tries to ride the pump before the dump happens.

Don’t get fooled by @bitcoin

The prominent Twitter account @bitcoin, which has over 950,000 followers, is not actually about bitcoin. It is a promotional account for bitcoin cash (BCH), seemingly run by bitcoin cash-focused news outlet Bitcoin.com.

Newcomers following this account may end up believe that bitcoin cash is the same as bitcoin and buy the altcoin instead. Hence, it is best not to follow and take advice from this account. Unless, of course, you want to diversify into bitcoin cash (BCH).

Don’t try to buy “the next Bitcoin”

Finally, a very common mistake of new crypto investors is to try to find “the next Bitcoin.” There are a number of cryptocurrency projects that claim to be the next Bitcoin in an (effectively fraudulent) attempt to entice newcomers to buy. There is only one Bitcoin and their altcoins are not it.

Find the latest Bitcoin news here.",,https://mashable.com/article/central-banks-response-to-facebook-libra/,"Facebook has only just revealed its far-reaching cryptocurrency plans, but Libra is already prompting global financial institutions to take action.

Central banks are reportedly becoming more interested in the idea of creating their own digital currencies following Facebook's Libra reveal, as evidenced by new comments from the head of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS),

As the bank used by central bankers. BIS is, in the words of Quartz, among the ""the stodgiest of stodgy institutions."" But BIS bank head Agustín Carstens now says central banks have to take digital currency much more seriously as a result of Facebook's move.

“Many central banks are working on it; we are working on it, supporting them. And it might be that it is sooner than we think that there is a market and we need to be able to provide central bank digital currencies,"" Carstens said in a new interview with the Financial Times.

So what is it about Libra that has captured the attention of central banks in a way that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others have not? It appears that there are two main factors at play.

The first is that Facebook's approach, which ties Libra's value to established world currencies — what's known as a stablecoin — ensures that Libra will be much more, well, stable. While Bitcoin and others are known for sometimes massive fluctuations, Libra is expected to remain relatively flat, making it more like actual ""money,"" as FT points out.

Also at play, though, are very real concerns that Facebook's entry into financial services could cause it to become even more powerful – potentially at the expense of big banks.

""A big tech could be small in financial services and yet rapidly establish a dominant position by leveraging its vast network of users and associated network effects,"" BIS writes in its newly-released annual report, which examines the potential impact large tech firms could have on financial institutions at length. ""In this way, the rule of thumb that encouraging new entry is conducive to greater competition can be turned on its head,"" the report says.

Though the BIS report doesn't only focus on Facebook, it's clear the social network is getting a lot of attention. In a speech on the potential risks posed by tech companies, BIS head of research Hyun Song Shin made it clear that the bank is taking Libra very seriously.

Big tech’s entry into #financialservices such as payments, savings and credit, could make the sector more efficient and boost #financialinclusion, but also brings risks, says @HyunSongShin - https://t.co/me0ndYn2t9 pic.twitter.com/nVS8JYOSDy — Bank for International Settlements (@BIS_org) June 30, 2019

""As the digital economy expands across borders, there is a need for international cooperation on rules and standards,"" Shin said. ""The recent proposal by Facebook to launch a digital currency, Libra, has underscored the importance of cross-border cooperation.""

Facebook (and its other partners) still have quite a bit of work to do before Libra is ready for the masses. And no one really knows what impact it will have, or if it will even take off.

But the fact that powerful central banks are taking it seriously enough to start openly discussing the possibility of their own digital currencies underscores just how much Facebook is already influencing the traditional banking system.",2019-06-30 19:58:49+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-link-btc-neo-leo-eth,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

From being outright dismissive of cryptocurrencies to adopting them, most central banks have come a long way. Research by the International Monetary Fund shows that several countries, both developed and developing, are toying with the idea of launching their own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). While Uruguay has already launched a CBDC pilot program, others are likely to follow suit soon.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is confident that cryptocurrencies are unlikely to pose a threat to the core business of the banking system. However, he believes that cryptos will provide healthy competition to the banks. JPMorgan plans to launch its own cryptocurrency JPM Coin by end of 2019. Similarly, Switzerland-based online bank Dukascopy is exploring options to develop its own stablecoin, called “Dukascash,” that will be pegged to the euro, Swiss franc, and U.S. dollar.

Institutional and large traders, who were previously wary of investing in cryptocurrencies, seem to be warming up to the idea and are using crypto to diversify their portfolio. Billionaire Henry Kravis has invested in a crypto fund launched by Ben Forman, who previously worked at his firm, KKR & Co.

The fundamentals in the blockchain and crypto space are improving rapidly. Will this boost prices higher or will the cryptocurrencies enter a minor correction and consolidate the recent gains? Let’s analyze the charts and try to find out.

LINK/USD

Chain Link (LINK) is the best performing major cryptocurrency. It has rallied more than 110% in the past seven days. Bulk of the gains came after Coinbase Pro announced listing of the cryptocurrency on June 26. Can the momentum continue?

As the LINK/USD pair has a relatively short trading history, we will use the daily chart to analyze it. The trend is clearly up as it has been making new lifetime highs on a regular basis. With the recent leg of the up-move, the RSI has risen deep into overbought territory, which suggests that the rally has been overextended in the short term.

If the rally stalls, the digital currency might correct to $3.34471, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent leg of the up-move. Below this level, we expect strong buying in $3.09630–$2.7455 zone, which corresponds to the 50% and 61.80% retracement levels.

Contrary to our assumption, if the rally continues, it can reach Fibonacci extension levels of $5.30 and above it $6.10. However, we give it a low probability of occurring in the short term.

BTC/USD

In the past week, bitcoin (BTC) led the bull market from the front. It easily scaled the overhead resistance of $12,000 and came very close to $14,000. The scintillating run is reminiscent of the vertical rally seen during the previous bull market. Its market dominance rose to over 60% during the week, the highest in the past two years. This shows that buyers are preferring bitcoin over other altcoins. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, warned that the bullish sentiment in bitcoin might not rub off to altcoins.

Many central banks in the developed countries have indicated that they are likely to ease their monetary policy to support respective economies. Deutsche Bank executive Jim Reid believes this policy initiative has increased the demand for bitcoin. A report by institutional crypto lender Genesis Capital shows huge institutional interest in bitcoin in the past 12 months. They believe this might also be a contributing factor in the recent surge in the top cryptocurrency.

While there are many reasons for the rise in bitcoin’s price, as traders, should we jump on the bandwagon or wait for lower levels to buy?

During the week, the BTC/USD pair reached a high of $13,973.5. However, profit booking was seen at higher levels that dragged the price to below $12,000. Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the price back above $12,000. If successful, it will keep the momentum alive. The target levels to watch on the upside are $13,973.50 and above it $15,433.33.

The trend remains bullish as the 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone. But if the bears defend the overhead levels, the pair might correct to $10,740.35 and below it to $9977.33, where we expect buyers to step in.

We are against the idea of chasing prices higher because vertical rallies are unsustainable and risky. Bitcoin is likely to correct or consolidate for a few days before resuming the uptrend. Therefore, traders can wait and buy on dips once the price stabilizes.

NEO/USD

NEO aims to build a robust ecosystem to stay ahead of the competition. NEO Global Development officially launched the previously announced $100 million EcoBoost program, which will have three phases. In the first phase, the program will establish various partnerships that will form a network to support the projects in the NEO ecosystem. Can this propel the price higher?

The NEO/USD pair is facing resistance in the $20–$25 zone. Therefore, a few weeks of consolidation is possible. On the downside, the pair will find support at the moving averages, which are on the verge of a bullish crossover.

If the price rebounds off the moving averages, the bulls will again try to scale the resistance of $25. If successful, a rally to $42 is probable.

Nonetheless, if the moving averages fail to provide support, the correction can extend to $8.17090666, below which a retest of the lows is likely.

LEO/USD

UNUS SED LEO (LEO), the recently launched token by iFinex, the parent company of Bitfinex, has made steady progress since listing on May 20 and has reached the 13th spot in terms of market capitalization. Can it continue its bull run and make a place among the top 10 cryptocurrencies? Let’s analyze the charts and try to find out.

We will use the daily charts because the LEO/USD pair has a short trading history. After the volatility on the day of listing, the pair has risen from a low of $1.00750 on May 21 to a high of $2 on June 26. That is a 98.51% gain in just over a month.

Currently, the price has been consolidating between $1.710 and $2. If the bulls push the price above $2 and sustain it, a rally to $2.29 and above it to $2.49 is probable.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $1.710, it will signal weakness and a drop to $1.42 is likely.

ETH/USD

As cryptocurrencies emerge out of a long bear market, transactions on the Ethereum network rose above one million on June 28, reaching the highest level since May 2018. Seychelles-based securities exchange MERJ is planning to become the first exchange to offer trading in a regulated security token on the national stock market. Will ether extend its recovery or will it enter a correction?

Though the ETH/USD pair broke out of the overhead resistance at $320.840, it failed to sustain above it and meet the pattern’s target objective of $557.43.

The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that buyers have the upper hand.

The pair might correct to the 20-week EMA. It will turn negative if the bears sink the price below both the moving averages.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bridging-the-gap-between-bitcoin-and-global-regulators,"Shin’ichiro Matsuo is a research professor and the director of B-TED research center at Georgetown University. He is also a co-founder of the BSafe.network, a global blockchain research test network used by 31 universities.

Since 2015, when bitcoin became an issue for regulators like the state of New York, the regulation of cryptocurrency (the G20 now calls it as a crypto asset) has been discussed in many places, mainly at bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

However, Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency has changed the landscape, ensuring a massive number of debates on regulation are likely ahead. To be sure, these debates will be about the size of companies specializing in internet technologies more than they are about technology architecture.

Yet, throughout the history of crypto asset and blockchain, regulators have been considered an enemy, even as most governments have sought new financial innovations based on the blockchain.

The main issue is, we still don’t have proper communication channels among stakeholders in this ecosystem. Regulators don’t have a functional language to talk with open-source engineers. Open-source engineers sometimes do not want to speak with regulators.

Business entities wish to use new and immature technologies by avoiding frictions with regulation. Citizens need transparency to business entities, but there are no standard criteria to ensure transparency of business. Generally (and I hope) regulators don’t want to discourage innovation, and open-source engineers don’t want to facilitate crimes. The goals of both are almost the same.

But, to make the situation more productive, we need to solve this communication problem. That is now beginning to happen.

Historical discussion at the G20

On June 8 and 9 of this year, the G20’s financial ministers and central bank governors met in Fukuoka, Japan, bringing together a group of 20 governments that discuss issues related to economics.

The FSB, FATF and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are the organizations which form regulations under G20 leadership. Before the G20 financial track, the FSB published an insightful report titled “Decentralized financial technologies: Report on financial stability, regulatory and governance implications.”

This report emphasized the importance of multi-stakeholder discussions, and that regulations and laws are not an 100 percent perfect tool for forming a healthy ecosystem. It concluded contributions from all stakeholders, including open-source engineers, are essential.

On June 8, the G20 held “G20 High-level Seminar on Financial Innovation Our Future in the Digital Age” to discuss the issue of multi-stakeholder governance.

This was indeed the genesis block of discussions by different stakeholders, including Klas Knott, the vice-chair of FSB, Brad Karr, managing director of IIF (a world group of established banks), Adam Back, the famous cryptographer, Shinichiro Matsuo (myself) who represents neutral academia views, and Jun Murai (moderator), the famous “Internet Samurai” who developed the first-ever inter-university internet communications network in Japan.

Knott firstly explained the FSB report and the views of his fellow regulators, including their regulatory goals. Karr went on to discuss many potential applications of decentralized finance, including financial inclusion. Back explained how blockchain technology is an excellent tool to achieve regulatory goals.

I discussed how multi-stakeholder discussion would facilitate healthy permissionless innovations in decentralized finance. We further agreed that the multi-stakeholder discussion is essential for decentralized finance to be made real.

As a result of this seminar and G20 discussion, the following historical sentence was written in the official communique.

“We welcome the FSB report on decentralized financial technologies, and the possible implications for financial stability, regulation and governance, and how regulators can enhance the dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders.”

What multi-stakeholder governance means

In general, governments tend to keep their right to control everything. The internet, which creates a global space of communication, was the first challenge to this order. Here, “global” is different from “international,” because it is independent from the nation.

The internet is also one of the most successful cases of multi-stakeholder governance.

Even in the case of the internet, the government tried to be the only entity of governance, but the effort failed; governments are one of the stakeholders of Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

This structure is an excellent foundation that facilitates a huge amount of permissionless innovation, but is also compliant with regulations. A similar situation will happen in finance, and this is the reason why the FSB and G20 are working toward the communique, through the involvement of multi-stakeholders might imply reducing their power of governance.

Here, stakeholders include open-source developers, regulators, business entities, consumers and academia, who are all seeking to solve the current chaos in terms of regulation and innovation in finance. I think it is good to start with have common understandings of regulatory goals; they are financial stability, consumer protection and preventing crimes.

Multi-stakeholder discussion on these goals will create healthier governance than regulation.

Academia facilitates the dialogue

Unfortunately, communications among stakeholders are not sufficient at this moment. However, we need more calm dialogue based on shared understandings and based on academically reviewed pieces of evidence.

One piece of good news is there are several existing initiatives which facilitate discussions among stakeholders. The Scaling Bitcoin workshop was established in 2015 to create a forum for technology discussions led by academics. Likewise, regulators today discuss their work with academics and economists.

This in mind, I believe academia can serve as a good trust anchor and neutral foundation to connect all stakeholder in one place.

A group of universities (currently 31 universities from 14 countries) called BSafe.network has started a new initiative to facilitate multi-stakeholder discussions based on its global neutrality. Right after the G20 financial track meeting, BSafe.network held a multi-stakeholder workshop “G20 meets G-20” with the University of British Columbia. It was the first event of a preliminary series of multi-stakeholder discussions.

A similar workshop, “Decentralized Financial Architecture Workshop,” will be co-located with Scaling Bitcoin 2019 Tel-Aviv, and we hope to see real engagement between regulators and bitcoin engineers.

Observing the current debates on Facebook’s Libra, I conclude we need more moderated and academia-backed discussions to make innovations healthier. The fact is, the Libra Association does not explain how their architecture achieves regulatory goals. Common understandings on regulatory goals and architecture among all stakeholders are essential to start a regulation discussion.

This is a good test case to apply the multi-stakeholder governance.

It may be more difficult than the case of internet governance to establish a formal body for multi-stakeholder discussion on finance. It might take more than a year. However, I believe the historical message triggered by the G20 and a series of workshops will open the door to a new era of a healthy blockchain ecosystem.

The price of Bitcoin has quietly been on fire of late. You can be forgiven for missing out because the cryptocurrency has attracted much less fanfare this time around.

After bottoming in the US$3,000 range for one Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has risen to more than US$11,500 per coin. That’s off a bit from recent highs in the US$13,000 range, but you can’t deny the trend.

It’s easy to see why some investors are excited about Bitcoin specifically and cryptocurrency generally. The benefits to having an anonymous way to transfer money are obvious, especially in today’s inter-connected world. But at the same time, these folks don’t want to go out and physically buy any Bitcoin.

There’s a solution to this. These investors can buy one of the Bitcoin-related stocks that have popped up on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Let’s take a look at one of those companies, Hut 8 Mining (TSXV:HUT).

Hut 8 Mining has two Bitcoin mining facilities in Alberta, with a larger one located in Medicine Hat and a smaller version located in Drumheller. The Medicine Hat assets consist of 56 BlockBox data centres operating at a maximum capacity of 62 megawatts. The Drumheller facility has 29 BlockBox data centres operating at a maximum capacity of 32.5 megawatts.

The two sites in Alberta were chosen because of low electricity costs. Mining Bitcoin uses a lot of power, so keeping input costs down is a good thing.

The company uses Bitfury designed data centres for mining, which it claims are the best and most advanced units out there. As part of a partnership, Bitfury owns 47% of Hut 8 shares.

In 2018, these data centres mined 5,592 Bitcoins at an average cost of US$3,433 per Bitcoin. Costs rose to US$3,951 to mine a Bitcoin in its most recent quarter, an increase management attributes to colder weather in Alberta.

The good news is the company began to hoard Bitcoin on its balance sheet when the price was low — a move that is paying off today. At the end of the first quarter, it retained 2,615 Bitcoins. Based on the price of the cryptocurrency today, the value of those digital assets alone is a little more than US$30 million.

The economics of mining Bitcoin have also stayed about the same versus the latter part of 2018, while the value of the cryptocurrency has skyrocketed. This bodes well for the future.

The opportunity

An opportunity exists today with Hut 8 shares, because while the price of Bitcoin has soared higher, shares haven’t. Eventually, this gap should narrow.

Since the beginning of 2019, Hut 8 shares are up an impressive 97%. But the price of Bitcoin is up 211%. While I understand that Hut 8 has a few warts and might warrant a bit of a discount, the gap between the two is simply too wide.

In fact, it’s easy to argue Hut 8 shares are poised to go much higher if Bitcoin continues its upward march. Hut 8’s mining costs should stay the same while the underlying product it produces is worth more. This translates into much higher profits.

Then there’s the sentiment factor. As Bitcoin keeps marching higher, it gets more and more attention. Folks will want to invest, which will drive up the price of all Bitcoin-related investments. Hut 8 would surely benefit from this.

The bottom line

If you’re a Bitcoin bull, there are two ways you can play this trend. Buying individual Bitcoins is the pure play, but it’s a complex process some investors might not want to experience. The easy way is to buy Hut 8 shares.

If Bitcoin keeps marching higher, Hut 8 shares won’t be far behind. You’ll be kicking yourself for missing out on this buying opportunity.",2019-06-30,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keiser said that with the development of the cryptocurrency space and adoption of Segregated Witness (Segwit) and the Lightning protocol, people began to better understand the store of value bitcoin offers, as well as scaling that would happen off chain. This, per Keiser, made crypto owners move their funds back into “the most secure chain [bitcoin].”

Keiser further projected that altcoins are going to pennies or even out of existence, because “all that cash is going to flow into bitcoin.” He reasoned that with bitcoin’s market current dominance 60% — which Keiser purports could go to 80%–90% — “the altcoin phenomenon is finished,” he stated.

Recently, veteran trader and author Peter Brandt predicted that bitcoin will continue to grow but altcoins will not feel the benefits. Brandt said that unlike the previous bull market cycle in 2017, bitcoin’s gains would not have a knock-on effect elsewhere. He summarized, “Cryptomaniancs expect alts to do so again — they may be very disappointed.”

In late June, ThinkMarkets chief market analyst Naeem Aslam predicted that bitcoin will hit somewhere between $60,000 and $100,000 during its next bull run. He argues that by hitting $20,000, discussion will move from conservative estimates exceeding the number one coin’s all-time high to forecasts of $50,000; from there, breaking $50,000 will move the price target to $100,000.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/g20-leaders-declaration-crypto-assets-commitments/,"G20 Leaders Issue Declaration on Crypto Assets - A Look at Their Commitments

The G20 leaders jointly issued a declaration on crypto assets at the end of their summit in Osaka, Japan. They declared their commitments, reaffirmed that crypto assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability, and requested further work done by standard-setting bodies.

G20 Leaders’ Declaration

The G20 leaders’ summit, the largest meeting Japan has ever hosted, wrapped up Saturday. During the two-day event, the G20 leaders and the heads of invited guest countries and international organizations met to discuss important issues including the global economy, trade and investment, innovation, digitization, and global finance. At the conclusion of the summit, the G20 leaders jointly issued a declaration which includes statements on crypto assets.

“We, the leaders of the G20, met in Osaka, Japan on 28-29 June 2019 to make united efforts to address major global economic challenges,” their declaration begins. “We will work together to foster global economic growth, while harnessing the power of technological innovation, in particular digitalization, and its application for the benefit of all.”

On the subject of global finance, the G20 leaders said that “Technological innovations can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy,” elaborating:

While crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, we are closely monitoring developments and remain vigilant to existing and emerging risks.

The leaders’ declaration adds to the joint statement by the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at the end of their meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, on June 8 and 9. The finance ministers and central bank governors specifically mentioned the risks from crypto assets relating to “consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT).”

Requests to FSB and Other Standard-Setting Bodies

The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. The Board submitted three reports to the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting. The first was a directory of crypto asset regulators. The second details standard-setting organizations’ regulatory approaches and work underway on crypto assets. The third focuses on the financial stability, regulatory and governance implications of decentralized financial technologies.

The G20 leaders declared:

We welcome on-going work by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other standard-setting bodies and ask them to advise on additional multilateral responses as needed.

Their declaration adds: “We also welcome the FSB’s work on the possible implications of decentralized financial technologies and how regulators can engage other stakeholders. We also continue to step up efforts to enhance cyber resilience.”

FSB Chairman Randal K. Quarles sent a letter to the G20 leaders ahead of the summit, outlining progress by the Board over the past year. “Harnessing the benefits of financial innovation while containing risks – a deep and early understanding of how technological innovation may transform financial institutions and markets is key for harnessing benefits while containing risks,” he wrote. Using crypto assets as an example, Quarles stated:

A wider use of new types of crypto-assets for retail payment purposes would warrant close scrutiny by authorities to ensure that they are subject to high standards of regulation.

“The FSB and standard-setting bodies will monitor risks very closely and in a coordinated fashion, and consider additional multilateral responses as needed,” the chairman’s letter concludes.

According to the FSB, some members noted that “the policy implications of crypto-assets do not always fit neatly into existing remits, which could result in significant regulatory asymmetries, potentially including with respect to investor and consumer protection issues.” Meanwhile, some members “consider that the majority of issues can be addressed with existing policy tools.”

In conclusion, the Board “recommends that the G20 keep the topic of regulatory approaches and potential gaps, including the question of whether more coordination is needed, under review.” In addition, the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors “welcome progress on the FSB’s initiative to identify effective practices for response to and recovery from cyber incidents.”

No Risk to Financial Stability

The FSB reported to the G20 in March last year that crypto assets did not pose risks to global financial stability but noted that this assessment could change if they “were to become significantly more widely used or interconnected with the core of the financial system.” This month, the Board updated its assessment of crypto assets’ impact on global financial stability, stating:

To date, the FSB continues to assess that crypto-assets do not pose material risks to global financial stability at present, but that they do raise a number of further policy issues beyond financial stability.

The Board additionally wrote that it “assesses that vigilant monitoring remains warranted particularly as a variety of new products and services seem to be under development.” Another report on crypto assets including developments in stablecoins and tokenization will be published in September.

Commitment to FATF Standards

Another standard-setting body that has been actively working on crypto assets is the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization which develops policies in areas such as combating money laundering. The FATF issued new guidance on the risk-based approach for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) on June 21. However, some industry participants have raised concerns over the implementation of some of the recommendations.

Regarding work done by the FATF on crypto assets, the G20 leaders’ declaration details:

We reaffirm our commitment to applying the recently amended FATF Standards to virtual assets and related providers for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.

They further declared: “We welcome the adoption of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Interpretive Note and Guidance.”

At the end of their two-day meeting on June 9, the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors similarly declared: “We reaffirm our commitment to applying the recently amended FATF Standards to virtual assets and related providers for AML and CFT.”

The FATF issued a report on June 27 ahead of the G20 summit to update the leaders regarding its work on crypto assets. “Under the Japanese Presidency, the G20 has continued to express its support for the FATF with a view to promote swift and effective implementation of the FATF standards worldwide,” the money-laundering watchdog explained, adding:

Technological innovations, including those underlying virtual assets like blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, may deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy.

In addition, the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors also welcome work done by the International Organization of Securities Commissions on “crypto asset trading platforms related to consumer and investor protection and market integrity.”

Global Unified Voice for Crypto Industry

Responding to the FATF recommendations, policymakers, government officials, and representatives of a number of crypto companies gathered to discuss challenges of implementing them at the V20 summit, a conference concurrent to the G20 summit which also took place in Osaka on June 28 and 29.

At the conclusion of the summit, a group of national industry associations signed a Memorandum of Understanding “to establish an association to provide a global unified voice for the virtual asset industry,” as news.Bitcoin.con previously reported.

A notable rise in the price of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies in the run up to the libra announcement on June 18, and since, suggests a market directly responding to this possibility and bolstered by it.

Of course, the price of bitcoin is known to rise and fall sharply on a fairly regular basis. Yet there is no doubt that having one of the world’s largest and most influential corporations throwing its weight behind the technology will calm nerves and build confidence.

More importantly, it gives legitimacy to the idea that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are here to stay. And, as I have argued in my research, must be taken seriously, not least by regulators.

Read more: Facebook's libra has staggering potential – state control of money could end

In the same moment the world is introduced to libra, tensions between the United States and Iran continue to grow, with President Donald Trump increasing US sanctions against Iran. The two are not directly connected, but libra (or other cryptocurrencies) could offer Iran a route round its sanctions. This, of course, is not something Facebook intends – but Iran’s interest in cryptocurrencies could have a serious influence on libra’s future.

EPA-EFE

A troubled past

In their contemporary forms, bitcoin and blockchain have been around for roughly ten years. In this time cryptocurrencies have proliferated wildly. According to the cryptocurrency platform, CoinMarketCap, there are now at least 2,248 different kinds of tokens. Many of these are actively and enthusiastically exchanged and traded by a growing number of people.

The recent history of cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin specifically, has not been all that positive. Famously, in 2013, the illicit darknet marketplace Silk Road was shut down following an FBI investigation. The site’s founder, Ross Ulbricht, was imprisoned for life. Silk Road users relied heavily on bitcoin to ensure anonymity, and the libertarian ethos underpinning bitcoin appeared to fit well with Silk Road’s rejection and evasion of authority and regulation.

What was so attractive for many about Silk Road, bitcoin and aspects of blockchain technology in general, was the fact that together they enable people to side step the usual legal constraints and regulations that apply online and offline when it comes to financial transactions. The anonymity bitcoin offers enables people to buy and sell just about anything without detection.

Silk Road offered a form of freedom to its users they were unlikely to have enjoyed previously. But this, of course, put it at loggerheads with laws and regulations in most countries and jurisdictions. While the Silk Road marketplace is now gone, cryptocurrency and blockchain are attracting more interest than ever before. At the same time governmental oversight of the technology continues to lag behind. Although things may be about to change on that front.

Crypto-Iran

Iran has long recognised the benefits of developing capabilities around crypto-assets and blockchain technology to counter US sanctions. This has included attempts to develop its own state-backed cryptocurrency.

That Iran might use Facebook’s new cryptocurrency libra to dance around US sanctions, a la Silk Road, is entirely speculative. Given Facebook’s contentious track record on the management of user data in recent years, and the fact that it is yet to convince US lawmakers and financial regulators of the legitimacy of its project, Iran, let alone billions of Facebook users, may not even get a chance to use libra at all.

Read more: US-Iran tensions: no route for de-escalation in sight

However, the potential for Iran to use libra raises serious questions about the level of control that should be demanded over cryptocurrency use. Robust state or corporate oversight of the technology (or perhaps a troubling blend of the two, as some have argued), could kill, once and for all, the libertarian dream that blockchains and cryptocurrencies have long encapsulated.

Facebook may well find stiff opposition to libra based on the vagaries of financial regulations. But it could well face stiffer opposition both politically, from governments who don’t want their foreign policies undermined – and commercially, from users not getting the empowering financial infrastructure they were promised, but, instead, a heavily controlled one.

Iran’s interest in cryptocurrencies encapsulates how, in today’s world, the empowerment and transparency that many advocates of cryptocurrencies and blockchains like to think is only a piece of code away is little more than a fantasy. Something always seems to spoil the party.

Blockchain has been celebrated as a technology to circumvent authority and regulation – the role of bitcoin in Silk Road and its continued use on the “dark web” since is evidence of this. Put simply, Iran is just another example of wanting to avoid the authorities.

But this could be a step too far for authorities. And this could have a serious effect on all cryptocurrencies – not just Facebook’s libra. If the perception in the US and elsewhere is that Iran intends to use the technology, this could require a significant rethink regarding the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchains.

It won’t mean the end of them, certainly not. But if this is the moment the technology truly became mainstream, then it could equally be the moment it finally yields to control and regulation – and the end of founder “Satoshi’s vision”. Libra could be a solution, but for some it may also look a lot like a problem.",2019-07-01 13:24:52+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/g20-leaders-reaffirm-position-on-cryptocurrencies-in-statement,"G20 leaders reaffirmed their previous stance towards cryptocurrencies in a declaration following the G20 Summit in Osaka on June 29

In the declaration, the G20 leaders state that cryptocurrencies do not currently constitute a threat to monetary stability, and that technological innovation can deliver significant benefit to the economy.

The participants also welcome the ongoing work on those assets by the Financial Stability Board and other standard setting bodies, and encourages multilateral responses when needed.

The authors of the declaration also reaffirm their determination to comply with the updated Financial Action Task Force anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing standards for cryptocurrencies. The document notes that the co-signers are also continuing to step up their commitments to enhance cybersecurity.

The contents of the declaration mostly reaffirm those in a joint communiqué published on the website of Japan’s Ministry of Finance on June 9, following the G20 meeting held in Fukuoka, Japan.

Additionally, the declaration contained statements on various other critical global topics, such as tackling corruption, addressing inequality and providing more equitable labor conditions.

The G20 also affirmed its commitment to addressing global climate change via public and private financing initiatives.

During a presentation at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei on Tuesday, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and CEO of the exchange, showcased a futures trading interface on Binance with features including longs and shorts on crypto assets.

“Binance will be launching a futures platform very soon. I don’t have the exact date yet. The simulation test version will be live in a few weeks,” he said. Referring to the screenshot of the interface showed on the stage, Zhao added:

“This is an actual screenshot of the working system. So Binance futures is coming.”

He indicated in his presentation slide that the leverage could be up to 20 times and will be offered for trading on bitcoin initially. While a firm releasing date of the feature is not yet set, a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk it plans to launch the test in about two weeks from now.

The futures trading feature comes after the firm rolled out margin trading on the platform last month.

“Margin trading will roll out to all users first (around July 11 or so), then futures testnet will come about a week after that,” the spokesperson added.

CoinDeal says the extension of its deal with Wolverhampton Wanderers gives the company the chance to get its brand in front of football fans around the world. With its logo proudly displayed on the team’s kit, the company estimates that its branding appeared on more than 350 million TV screens from June 2018 to April 2019.

The collaboration has also extended to advertising that highlights CoinDeal’s “fast verification procedures, security, multiple payment methods and top-flight support team.” One 40-second spot features some of the Wolves’ best-known players, and the promotion has attracted more than 1 million views since it made its debut on the exchange’s YouTube channel back in February.

CoinDeal says this partnership has long been about more than raising publicity for the crypto industry and driving mainstream adoption. According to the company, the sponsorship opportunity has forged new friendships and given its staff a newfound passion for football — so much so that the team regularly cheered on the Wolves throughout their Premier League campaign as they rubbed shoulders with the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.

Kajetan Mackowiak, the co-founder of CoinDeal, said:

“After an amazing season, we really made it our priority to come back for this season to be once again, global partners of the Wolves. We feel that this partnership has been incredibly beneficial to both sides involved, we truly feel like family here.

“There’s nothing better than game day in Wolverhampton — we try to be there as often as we can, regardless, we always make sure to cheer on and follow all games even in the office.”

Heading stateside

CoinDeal says it has become the largest crypto-fiat exchange in Europe since launching back in March 2018, but isn’t content sitting still. Now, the company is setting its sights on the United States.

To begin with, CoinDeal plans to be available in 14 states — Indiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia among them — with another 12 to follow in quick succession. The company believes its footprint in the U.S. will expand to 40 states by next year, once all of the necessary licenses have been acquired.

Explaining its motivation for going global, the exchange says it is keen to capitalize on statistics that suggest 40% of the U.S. population are open to the idea of cryptocurrency. Right now, CoinDeal claims that many existing exchanges are failing to meet the expectations of consumers — and the team believes there is an unparalleled, untapped potential of liquidity and potential traders who can benefit from their cutting-edge infrastructure.

Alex Strześniewski, the exchange’s business development director, said, “The US is the land of opportunity, and this may very well be the defining moment in our company's history.”

A powerful exchange

CoinDeal says that it offers its user base more than 40 cryptocurrency pairs — bringing together Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin with major fiat currencies including the euro, dollar, British pound, Polish zloty and Russian ruble. One intuitive feature enables the community to vote on which coins and tokens should be added next, and the company says this gesture enables everyone to take part in the growth of its trading platform.

To coincide with its stateside launch, CoinDeal has also unveiled the debut of a new utility token known as CDL. The company claims this token delivers higher liquidity, a greater number of trading pairs and the opportunity to benefit from lower trading costs.

According to the report, Busan city authorities are seeking to develop a blockchain-based digital currency project in collaboration with BNK Busan Bank, a subsidiary of local holding company BNK Financial Group.

Specifically, Busan is reportedly developing a crypto project in the form of stablecoin, a cryptocurrency pegged 1:1 to the local currency in the BNK Busan bank account. By issuing a local digital currency, Busan expects to revive the local economy, as well as to secure the leading position in blockchain, the report notes.

The news comes amid the upcoming establishment of South Korea’s blockchain regulation-free zone, for which Busan was selected as the preferred bidder along with its competitor Jeju Province, as reported in April 2019. As a part of the potential designation, Busan is reportedly going to promote blockchain tech in multiple industries, as well as to provide a basis for cryptos, particularly including initial coin offerings (ICOs).

In April, South Korea’s Ministry of Small and Medium Businesses (SMEs) and Startups said that the government plans to provide “extensive support if Busan develops its own blockchain-based currency structure or token economy.”

Earlier in February 2019, Busan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with blockchain company Hyundai Pay with the purpose of promoting blockchain industry through “contribution to the development of local ICT industry through mutual growth with related start-up businesses.”

Previously, South Korea’s government revealed plans to invest $3.5 million to create a blockchain-enabled virtual power plant in the city of Busan.

At press time, bitcoin prices in South Korea are once again trading at a notable premium to Western exchanges. The spread, popularly known as the “Kimchi Premium” after a Korean preserved food dish, rose to $1,048 on Sunday, the highest level since Feb. 24, 2018, according to data from cryptocurrency exchanges Bithumb and Coinbase.

Bithumb is South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange while Coinbase, headquartered in San Francisco, California, is the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange.

As of writing, the price differential on two exchanges is seen at $520.

Kimchi premium daily chart

As seen can be seen, the spread alternated between positive (premium) to negative (discount) in the range of +200 to -200 for nearly 15-months before rising sharply from $80 to $1,048 in the seven days to June 30.

Interestingly, the kimchi premium has spiked with bitcoin’s break above $10,000. While the spread is on the rise, it is still down 90 percent from the record high of $7,484 registered on Jan. 8, 2018.

Back then, a bull frenzy had gripped South Korea with the cryptocurrency reportedly drawing demand from many demographics, including college students and housewives. After all, BTC had rallied from $6,000 to $20,000 in the preceding two months.

With Korean’s paying nearly 25 percent premium, the government decided to clamp down on speculation in January 2018. As a result, the kimchi premium was all but evaporated by the end of February 2018.

Kimchi premium in the ether market

Other markets also witnessed a rise in the Kimchi premium last week. For instance, the spread between the price of ethereum’s ether (TH) token on South Korea exchanges and Western exchanges rose to $28.57 on Sunday, the highest level since May 2018. As of writing, the spread is seen at $14.40.

The kimchi premium in both bitcoin and the ethereum markets is falling back along with the correction in prices. While bitcoin is now trading at $10,500 representing a 24 percent drop from the recent high of $13,880, ether is changing hands at $286 – also down more than 20 percent from last week’s high of $365.

Continuing its wild ride, the digital currency dropped to $9,717 on Tuesday, down 8.1% on the day. Last Wednesday, the cryptocurrency shot up to $13,879, breaking through the $12,000 and $13,000 levels in less than two hours.

Bitcoin had languished below $6,000 for months, but was galvanised by Facebook’s plans to create a cryptocurrency called Libra next year.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Hide Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.



Other digital currencies have also fallen back. Reports that an investor placed a large short order on Sunday, betting that the bitcoin price would go down in coming days, sparked panic among investors.

Bitcoin has seen wild swings in the past, and some analysts say it could rise back to $20,000 again – or fall as low as $3,000. In late 2017, it rose to close to $20,000, before a spectacular collapse in 2018.

The cryptocurrency’s latest gyrations prompted the US economist Nouriel Roubini, a long-time critic, to say that the bitcoin price would eventually fall to zero. He tweeted: “Its true value is negative, not zero, given its toxic externalities! It will get to zero in due time.”

Nouriel Roubini (@Nouriel) Indeed Bitcoin is now down below 10k. Has lost a third of its value in less than a week. Still a long way to less than zero as its true value is negative not zero given its toxic externalities! It will get to zero in due time. https://t.co/Ek87DvRq6t

Simon Peters, an analyst at global investment platform eToro, said: “We appear to be in a period of indecision, where the market is figuring out where to go next after its heavy surge and sell-off.”

Investors hope Facebook’s entry into digital currencies will bring greater legitimacy to the sector. Regulators around the world have warned that the move could lead to greater controls and tougher regulation to protect consumers.

Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, cautiously welcomed Libra. He said the central bank would support new entrants into the UK financial system, but warned that Facebook would need to meet the highest regulatory standards.

Bloomberg reported last week that Henry Kravis, the co-founder of the US private equity firm KKR, had become the latest financier to bet on cryptocurrencies. He is investing in a cryptocurrency fund provided by ParaFi Capital.

Capitalizing on existing theories about the social media giant’s Libra protocol, the brief report suggested that publicity from mainstream consumers will ultimately flow into bitcoin.

The collateral attention will only help the bitcoin price and its overall acceptance, particularly in the face of global market uncertainty.

“I believe that Libra will allow users to be more inclined to use bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system while the uncertainties of the global markets are having investors flock into bitcoin as a store of value,” author Ryan Waldoch summarized.

His comments came a day before even bolder statements from Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin derivatives giant BitMEX.

Speaking to Bloomberg, Hayes, who will take on infamous bitcoin naysayer Nouriel Roubini in a head-to-head ‘duel’ later this week, had only one prognosis for Libra once its launches as a token.

“I think it will destroy commercial and central banks,” he said.

As Cointelegraph reported, Libra has already seen its fair share of criticism since Facebook unveiled its whitepaper last month. Concern focussed on its technical characteristics and data security, as well as the likelihood governments would attempt to ban it outright.

July will see a dedicated U.S. hearing about the project, as lawmakers already requested development stop until dialog is held.",,https://www.thestreet.com/investing/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-driven-by-halving-on-horizon-14999864,"It's difficult to miss bitcoin's parabolic price rise in June, despite its latest tumble.

The currency started 2019 below $4,000 and at one point last week neared $14,000 before stumbling this week and dipping below the $10,000 mark. Still, bitcoin appears to be experiencing one of its most profound bull runs since 2017 when the token eventually approached $20,000.

By most metrics, bitcoin is the best performing investment asset this year, outpacing stocks, bonds, gold, and oil in annual returns.

Much of this bullish sentiment is attributed to the ancillary excitement surrounding Libra, Facebook's long-awaited cryptocurrency. Information about the project was released in a white paper on May 18, bringing with it notable fanfare and speculation about the role of cryptocurrencies in the digital age.

At the same time, bitcoin's price began to rise, surpassing both the $10,000 and 11,000 thresholds in the days after the announcement. To be sure, there is a degree to which this is true.

For instance, a study by Yale professors Aleh Tsyvinski and Yukun Liu found that ""investor attention effect"" has a real impact on crypto markets. However, correlation and causation are not the same thing, and to assume that bitcoin's ascension is accredited exclusively to Libra's announcement is to miss the broader context of its ecosystem and the many factors that contribute to its price movements.

Blockchain Rewards Impact Price

The bitcoin blockchain is maintained by ""miners"" who deploy high-powered computers to solve the mathematical equations that validate the currency's transactions. Whoever completes this process fastest is compensated in newly minted bitcoin.

Currently, miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per ""block"" -- a term for a batch of data files on to bitcoin's network, much like a record book, that get recorded. Miners earn bitcoin for their efforts, but those rewards decrease over time. Much like ""real world"" precious metal mining, technology improvements yield faster bitcoin mining. Therefore, built into bitcoin's original plans is a ""halving"" mechanism that cut the reward to compensate.

The bitcoin reward halves every 210,000 blocks, which so far works out to every four years. For bitcoin wonks, the reward will hit to zero when miners hit bitcoin's limit of 21 million in ""circulation"" -- which, by the math, will be around year 2140. After that, miners will continue to get a reward for record keeping in the form of transaction fees.

The next change is scheduled for May 20, 2020 when rewards will diminish to 6.25 bitcoin per block created. This event, known as a ""halving,"" tends to have a positive impact on bitcoin's value, since it slows bitcoin's mining rate and creates scarcity.

Historical Precedence

We've seen this before.

When the bitcoin reward decreased from 50 bitcoin per block to 25 in 2012, the token saw a significant upward trend beginning in November 2011 that eventually more than doubled bitcoin's value by more than 300% over the next year.

Similarly, when block rewards halved to 12.5 bitcoin in 2016, the price saw a similar uptick nine months before the event.

To put it simply, investors tend to respond positively to a forthcoming block reward halving, a trend that begins roughly one year before the actual event. We currently reside squarely in that timeframe, and, although blockchain reward halving doesn't make the same headlines as Facebook's cryptocurrency, it's having an important impact on investor sentiment.

Of course, the upcoming reward halving isn't the only factor contributing to bitcoin's recent ascension. Investors increasingly view bitcoin as a hedge against global volatility, something that is evident in everything from the U.S. trade war with China to rising tensions with Iran and North Korea.

At the same time, bitcoin is gaining more support from institutional investors, and some major retailers are beginning to accept the cryptocurrency at checkout.

Taken together, bitcoin has several factors working in its favor, and they are collectively driving a bull run that is helping the first and most popular cryptocurrency maintain its prominence in the global financial ecosystem.

But before that operation gets going, Binance is once again reinventing itself and is preparing to offer Bitcoin Futures contracts at up to 20x leverage in addition to the margin trading the firm recently rolled out the beta version of. The addition of margin was met with a lackluster response due to the perceived low-leverage of just 2x maximum – will 20x Bitcoin Futures trading appease the masses looking for more from the industry leader?

Binance to Add Bitcoin Futures Trading with 20x Leverage

Binance is among the biggest names across the crypto space and for good reason. The company often is ahead of the trend, does right by the greater community at large, and is known for keeping funds “SAFU” under any and all circumstances.

The crypto community loves Binance for its exotic altcoin collection, Binance Coin token, and especially for its CEO Changpeng Zhao. The only negative press Binance has seen in recent weeks has been the lackluster debut of its margin trading products, and the company buckling under pressure from US regulators to block the country’s citizens from using the platform.

While complying with regulators is painful for crypto traders, it’s understandable for an industry leader looking to maintain its top spot. Margin trading is an entirely different beast, and while it’s nice to see leverage on Binance not too high given its users can buy crypto to trade on a credit card, 2x is low by any standard.

In what may be a move to offer a more attractive leverage point or simply to cater to a different type of trader, Binance has revealed that it will launch a new Bitcoin Futures trading platform fittingly called Binance Futures that offers up to 20x leverage.

How Does Binance Futures Leverage Stack Up to the Crypto Competition?

While speaking at Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that Binance Futures will only support BTC/USDT Futures with up to 20x leverage initially, but that more pairs and higher leverage is planned in the future.

While 20x leverage is certainly more attractive to traders seeking to margin trade than the 2x Binance had announced for their margin trading product, it’s still far less than most other exchanges across the industry.

Here we go!@binance just announced Binance Futures which will support 20x leverage for Bitcoin futures in the coming months. More sophisticated products. More liquidity. The virus is spreading 🔥 — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 2, 2019

These exchanges are likely to overshadow Binance’s 20x leverage until the company follows through with the promise of higher leverage in the future. However, the 20x leverage does easily trump the 2x Binance itself offers, and even beats other crypto companies offering leverage. OKEx and Kraken each offer between 3x and 5x leverage, while Bitfinex only currently offers up to 3.3x currently.

In the interview, Keiser said that the cryptocurrency market rally will exclude altcoins. Instead, all the crypto market value will reportedly flow into Bitcoin.

Keiser: Value will flow into Bitcoin

These somewhat controversial statements come as the cryptocurrency market has taken a slight dip. As some are debating whether the cryptocurrency market is just consolidating its gains before the next crypto bull run, Keiser’s statements come as a shock.

Specifically, Keiser notes that the cryptocurrency space is continually developing. For example, Keiser raises the adoption of the Lightning protocol and Segregated Witness (SegWit) as factors that make people better understand the store of value of Bitcoin.

This, along with a better understanding of off-chain scaling, are supposedly reasons making people move their funds back into the “most secure chain”, i.e. Bitcoin. However, Keiser argues that this comes at the expense of smaller altcoins. Moreover, he argues these altcoins are practically “finished”.

“No, there won’t be one [an altcoins bull run],” Keiser answered when asked about the potential for altcoins gains. In fact, Keiser projects that altcoins may “go to pennies” as investor are increasingly going to allocate their funds to Bitcoin.

“Altcoins are finished”

“Bitcoin Cash, the Roger Ver abomination, is going to ten bucks. Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, from Craig Wright, that’s going to ten bucks. Most, or all of these altcoins, are going to pennies, or they’re going to go out of existence, because all of that cash is going to flow to Bitcoin.”

Keiser further argued that the market dominance of Bitcoin would increase. What’s more, he also remarked that the “altcoin phenomenon is finished”.

“Look, the dominance index – and it’s the sixty percent again – it’s going, yeah, it [the market dominance of Bitcoin] is going to eighty percent, back to eighty, ninety percent. That’s where that’s going. And because that’s the only logical place for anyone who wants to be in crypto to be. And, the short answer is, in my view, the altcoin phenomenon is finished.”

Notably, this is in-line with a recent market forecast by veteran trader Peter Brandt. In it, Brandt predicted that while Bitcoin will continue to grow, altcoins will not feel the effects of this bull run. Nevertheless, it remains to see whether altcoins are indeed really “finished”.

On July 1, Joshua Green, CEO of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) implementation Bitcoin Verde, told the BCH community that the local government from Dublin, Ohio plans to mint a token using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). The unnamed SLP token will be used for city events, redeemed for city-branded swag, discounts, and can be given to volunteers who help Dublin prosper.

Dublin Ohio Plans to Launch a Token Using the Simple Ledger Protocol on Top of Bitcoin Cash

The Bitcoin Cash community has learned of a new SLP token used by a local U.S. government. Joshua Green, the creator of Bitcoin Verde, a full node client built from the ground up, announced that the city of Dublin Ohio plans to launch a city token built on the BCH network. When Green explained the project to the BCH community on Monday, he detailed that the token’s goal is to provide three functions for the residents of Dublin: digital identity, electronic polling system, and a token of value. Speaking with news.Bitcoin.com, Green noted that the Dublin token is actually a part of an RFP that Dublin published in October of last year.

“For their identity mechanism, we decided to use the same digital signature technology as the one used in Bitcoin (the Secp256k1 curve) because it’s gone through its trial-by-fire with the Bitcoin networks, and has a lot of community support, tools, and libraries,” Green said. “Plus it was something we had worked with already when building Bitcoin Verde. The intent behind the Dublin identity is to provide a digital means for identification that puts users in control of their data — allowing them to control if it’s shared and with whom, and even a way to revoke access to their data.”

“Dublin’s public polling mechanism uses their identity system to create anonymous ‘second identities’ and RSA keys to encrypt their responses, which allows them to be anonymous but also gives the user the ability to prove they’ve participated without revealing what their response was — Dublin intends for the public polling to be a tool for receiving feedback from the people about past and upcoming decisions,” the Bitcoin Verde developer explained. “An example we use internally is often asking: ‘What are your thoughts about the new roundabout on 33 and Riverside?’ We also envision this system to be useful for HOAs (Homeowner Associations) to set new policies (all without the city’s involvement).” Green insisted:

The Dublin token is intended to be a reward and barter system for Dublin’s citizens — to incentivize positive behavior. For instance, citizens may receive ‘Dublin Points’ for participating in volunteer programs and can use the points in exchange for city-branded swag, for priority parking, or can be redeemed by vendors for goods or rewards.

Dublin’s Token-Fueled Barter and Reward System

Green also revealed that his team is nearing the first public release of the token and he’s now able to discuss the project, which has been in stealth mode. The developer said that the team researched the SLP system a great deal and after the SLP project matured significantly, the developers grew confident that it would be a wise choice to serve as the platform for Dublin’s token.

“We investigated other blockchain and token implementations,” Green told the community on the Reddit forum r/btc. “But ultimately decided Bitcoin Cash’s scaling solution to be superior than other alternatives, and viewed the thriving developer community to be an important pillar to the platform’s longevity.” The developer added:

Dublin’s token is intended to be a barter and reward system to facilitate existing physical tokens and to incentivize positive behavior via rewards.

Green suggested that Dublin’s SLP token might also be used to digitize the cities already existing physical tokens. In the past, there have been many local towns or city-issued barter-like systems such as Ithaca New York’s ‘hour’ currency and in Massachusetts there’s Berkshire bucks (Berkshares). The Ithaca hour is actually the oldest and largest local currency system in the U.S and hours are used for town bartering, discounts, and other economic interactions. Berkshares or ‘Berkshire bucks’ in Massachusetts is a local currency accepted by 400 local merchants in the mountainous Berkshire region.

“Dublin’s token isn’t meant to be a currency per se, but with any distributed token we can’t really control what people do with them — I think that the local currencies are a really interesting case to learn from history and repeat the good decisions and avoid the bad ones,” Green explained when discussing the similarities and differences between other local currency systems. “To my knowledge, the Hours and Berkshares are (local) traditional paper currencies, not digital tokens, however, Liberland’s Merits are a BCH SLP token too, but I believe they’re trying to use it as a currency — which is great, and I think we can learn some lessons from them as things progress,” Green added. “I think if anything, the Merits and Dublin’s points help prove viability for other local governments to consider this path if it’s right for them.”

SLP Tokens Backed by the Security of the Bitcoin Cash Network Best Represent the City’s Intent

The Bitcoin Verde CEO said when the team considered creating Dublin’s token of value, the many benefits of the BCH network outweighed other blockchains that can create tokens. The biggest attribute was the low fees the Bitcoin Cash network provides so the cost of redeeming the token would not compete against the actual value received.

During the announcement, Green had emphasized that Dublin’s token is not backed by an asset and is only intended to resemble a coupon or barter system. The SLP token will use the baton system which means the city can issue additional tokens at any time. “We found this mechanism best represents the city’s intent behind the token of value,” Green explained. “Tokens are not expected to be directly tied to monetary value — For example, currently a (physical) beverage token at the Dublin Irish Festival may be purchased for $2, however, each token is not guaranteed to be “$2 of beer”, instead a vendor may offer a beer for 3 tokens, or a soda for 1 token, or whiskey for 4 to 6 tokens,” the developer added. We also asked Green if he thought other towns and cities might decide to emulate the ‘town-token’ idea using SLP-issued tokens in the future.

“I hope so,” Green replied. “We submitted a bid to the state of Rhode Island last week to give them a trial-run of Dublin’s system for their own use — The exciting thing here is use would be at the state level and could also explore some integration between the state and local government, which further paves the way for future adoption.”

Green also revealed that over the last few months the team has been discussing the token concept to surrounding cities and towns and even the state capital, Columbus. “While I cannot announce their direct involvement yet, I can say we have received amazing support and initiative around integrating with Dublin’s blockchain,” Green remarked. The creator also hinted that Dublin will have its own custom digital wallet for sending, receiving and storing the new token. Dublin’s token will be compatible with other SLP wallets like Bitcoin.com’s Badger wallet, Electron Cash, and Crescent Cash. The Bitcoin Verde developer also mentioned that his team looks forward to launching Dublin’s new token and concluded by saying:

We are excited to be releasing the first US government blockchain token and are thankful for having a local community that is both innovative and eager to dive into the future.

When asked if Abkhazia’s plans to create a large crypto mining farm are still valid, Khadjimba said that “unfortunately, there are some difficulties. We are trying to legitimize these processes so that they bring some revenue to the country's budget.” Khadjimba also pointed out that Abkhazia already hosts facilities illegally established by individuals.

Khajimba agreed with the remark that it is necessary to “put the whole thing on the state balance,” and added that “we want the state to govern such processes.” Despite the potential for legislative delays, Khajimba predicted that the plan to set up a mining farm can be implemented sooner rather than later.

Khadjimba’s statements were made in the wake of the news that Abkhazia’s Ministry of Economics approved a bill on the establishment of cryptocurrency mining activities in the country in late June. The proposed regulation defines legal, economic, organizational, and technical rules for the implementation of mining cryptocurrency activities in the republic.

As reported in January of this year, the Abkhazian government cut power to 15 mining facilities with a total capacity of 8,950 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which was purportedly equivalent to the electricity consumption of 1,800 households. The cuts were part of a series of “temporary measures to limit the consumption of electricity by certain categories of subscribers.""",,,,,,,

RELEASE THE TAPE YOU COWARD!",,https://www.coindesk.com/facebooks-david-marcus-libra-crypto-users-wont-have-to-trust-us,"Facebook’s David Marcus is pushing back against concerns about the social media giant’s new cryptocurrency project, Libra.

In a note published Wednesday on Facebook, Marcus addressed “a number of questions and a few misunderstandings” about the project.

The social media giant’s blockchain lead also confirmed he would be testifying before both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee on the project later this month.

In Wednesday’s post, Marcus sought to address a number of issues that have been raised by lawmakers and informed observers alike, including whether Libra is actually decentralized, why there isn’t a charter in place for the Libra Association and whether Libra can actually address financial inclusion.

Perhaps most notably, he addressed the widespread distrust of Facebook in the wake of Cambridge Analytica, 2016 election interference and other high-profile mishaps.

“Bottom line: You won’t have to trust Facebook to get the benefit of Libra,” Marcus wrote, adding:

“And Facebook won’t have any special responsibility over the Libra Network. But we hope that people will respond favorably to the Calibra wallet [made by Facebook]. We’ve been clear about our approach to financial data separation and we will live up to our commitments and work hard to deliver real utility.”

Facebook published a white paper and supporting documentation for Libra last month, but was immediately met with pushback from regulators worldwide.

Under various subheadings, Marcus addressed complaints about the project, including concerns that Libra would not be able to bank individuals who are currently under- or unbanked, as well as concerns about Facebook’s track record on consumer data protection.

“Someone wrote that the key reason people are unbanked is that they don’t have enough money to actually be banked, and claimed Libra wouldn’t solve this,” Marcus wrote, calling this explanation misguided.

In his view, Libra would lower the drawbridges to financial services for anyone with “a $40 smartphone and connectivity.”

Marcus also repeated a claim from the Calibra subsidiary’s public documentation in noting that Facebook would not have access to any financial data from the wallet provider.

“People will have many ways in which to use Libra and access the network,” he said. “You’ll be able to use a range of custodial and non-custodial wallets that will have full interoperability with one another, meaning you’ll be able to pay and receive payments across wallets from different companies, or use a software wallet you’d operate on your own.”

The company’s profit model for Libra would come from any commerce that occurs across its family of apps by ensuring that ads are more effective and advertisers are more motivated to buy space on Facebook’s platforms, he said.

“We are looking forward to continuing to engage with the various communities and stakeholders. We want to hear your feedback, and we are committed to taking the time to get this right,” Marcus said in his conclusion.

Decentralized token

While Libra will be controlled by a small number of entities at launch, it will gradually decentralize over time, he said.

Facebook, which is one of 28 founding members for the Libra Association – the governing association which will be responsible for overseeing the Libra network after it launches – will ultimately have the same amount of power over the network that its other launch associates will have, Marcus said.

“It’s easy to assume from the headlines that Libra is only associated with Facebook, but that is not the case,” Marcus wrote, adding:

“But it was important to start with trusted entities that could operate in a regulated environment and with the operational expertise required to ensure the integrity of the network in its foundational stage. I’d argue that one hundred geographically distributed, industry-diverse organizations is quite decentralized. … As a comparison, often the concentration of power in the hands of those running software for mining pools on other blockchains is overlooked.”

“But there’s no question that there are more decentralized blockchains available, and that the Libra Association must strive to gradually decentralize it further,” he said.

Each of the founding members will be a part of setting up the Libra Association’s governance rules and “other key decisions,” as part of an effort to limit the amount of power Facebook has over the network, he claimed.

The acquisition will enable the firm to introduce crypto transactions on traditional, non-bank ATMs in the United States.

Just Cash developed a software to retrofit ATMs to sell cryptocurrencies via a customer’s debit card without having to upgrade the machine’s hardware.

Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond confirmed that the technology has already been introduced to some ATM machines, a process that will continue until the end of next year.

There are approximately 250,000 non-bank ATMs that can potentially be upgraded with this feature. By partnering with two of the three major producers of non-bank automated teller machines – Nautilus Hyosung, Triton, and Genmega, though he was unable to disclose which ones – Diamond said Coinsquare expects to integrate with approximately 170 thousand machines across nearly all 50 states.

“We will outnumber the total number bitcoin ATMs within a year,” Diamond said.

Users will be able to buy and transact with bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, dash, litecoin, stellar, ripple, doge, among others directly through their bank accounts.

The machine will then offer a printed receipt that shows the user’s private and public keys, “effectively your paper wallet,” Diamond said.

The company’s roadmap includes a full US expansion in 2020, with the ATMs serving as an entry point. Just Cash’s software will “piggyback on the regulatory efforts” Coinsquare has pulled through in anticipation of this market entry.

Diamond hopes the ATMs serve as an efficient on-ramp to the crypto-uninitiated.

“Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” he said in a statement.

Diamond also said this feature will “bridge the gap” between traditional banking and the crypto industry, though he does not expect to integrate the software with bank partners soon.

“One, we need to believe [banks] want to use it… Banks have been hesitant to get involved [in anything crypto,]” he said, adding bank ATMs require the development of additional software upgrades, as each entity runs proprietary software.

The merged firms will operate under the Coinsquare brand, though Just Cash will maintain a degree of autonomy.

Luxembourg-based Argento, a securitization firm, joined forces with London Block Exchange (LBX) to issue the bitcoin-denominated bond, which is regulated under the United Kingdom’s regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

“We are thrilled to have structured and produced the world’s first institutional grade bitcoin-denominated financial product,” Argento manager Phil Millo commented.

“The large investment banks really dropped the ball on this one.”

The Argento-LBX bond represents a first in regulated cryptocurrency products, in that it contains no fiat exposure for investors. It is readily available via Bloomberg Terminal, and is the first crypto product to have its own ISIN code.

Various durations are available, Argento conspicuously naming them after crypto-specific phenomena such as ‘FOMO,’ ‘HODL’ and ‘MOON.’

For example, a market study conducted by LendEDU last year revealed that, out of a thousand gamers who were found to spend anywhere between six to 10 hours playing a game of their choice, nearly 69% of them made use of micropayments — with each individual, on average, spending $84.67 in the game.

However, before delving any deeper into this subject, it is better to outline the various earning models that video game developers have been making use of since the industry came to the forefront in the mid-1980s. During the first two decades of its existence, publishers primarily relied on a model referred to as “pay-to-play,” which essentially entailed a user paying the full price for a video game (CD-ROM/cartridge) to enjoy uninterrupted access to the title. However, over the past 10-15 years, publishers have started to use a new approach that essentially reduces the game into small parts, with the price of each supplement being charged separately through a digital transaction medium called “virtual currency.”

With that being said, micropayments have received a lot of flack from the global gaming community over the past couple of years: firstly, because they appear to serve as quick cash-grab schemes for game developers, and secondly, because they seem to take away a sense of accomplishment from the game itself.

Micropayments — shortcomings and advantages

Simply put, a micropayment is a commercial transaction that involves an extremely small amount of money — usually ranging from a several cents to a few dollars. Within this structure, there exist a host of business models (prepay, post-pay, pay-as-you-go, etc.) that are quite often employed by gaming companies to lure in more money from their clientele.

Popular titles such as FIFA, Fortnite and NBA2K have successfully made use of the microtransaction structure over the past decade. For example, even though Fortnite is a free-to-play video game, it was able to generate a whopping $2.4 billion in revenue for its publisher, Epic Games, last year. If that wasn’t enough, a recent study by Juniper Research indicated that in-game transactions are expected to surge past the $160 billion mark by 2022.

And while microtransactions get a lot of bad press on the internet, there are certain advantages for having such in-game content available. For instance, Fortnite’s cosmetic microtransaction system has largely been welcomed by the game’s followers, since it allows users to unlock new skins by simply playing the game for longer periods of time, without having to pay anything.

However, on the flipside, we can also see that there have been many instances in the past when developers have gone a little too far with their in-game payment schemes. This is best highlighted by a recent controversy that emerged when a Reddit user by the name of MBMaverick claimed that, even after purchasing EA’s latest Star Wars Battlefront 2 title, he still had to pay a whopping $80 to unlock Darth Vader — one of the series’ most central and iconic characters.

On the subject, he stated:

“This is a joke. I'll be contacting EA support for a refund... I can't even playing f---ing Darth Vader?!?!? Disgusting. This age of ‘micro-transactions’ has gone WAY too far. Leave it to EA though to stretch the boundaries.”

When is it too far?

The issue of microtransactions is on full display when one starts playing the hit game Grand Theft Auto Online, a multiplayer video game that comes as a free add-on with Grand Theft Auto V (a copy of which costs around $60). This is because the game’s developers have devised the narrative in such a way that it is extremely difficult for nonpaying players to earn any in-game money by going through the title’s standard missions. As a result, most gamers often get frustrated and resort to buying credit packs that usually cost them anywhere between $19.99 and $99.99.

Similarly, EA Sports’ FIFA franchise is also known to charge its players heavy microtransaction fees, even after they have purchased a licensed copy of the title. When playing the game, in order for users to unlock big packs containing a chance of obtaining a high-rated player, they need to either earn coins by completing a host of challenging tasks — or purchase FIFA Points. However, more often than not, players end up buying these points from EA’s online store — thereby shelling out up to $100. Even then, though, the players are not guaranteed to pack any of soccer’s biggest stars.

To further elaborate on this issue, we can see that there have been several instances of gamers in the past who have spent thousands of dollars on microtransactions, only to realize their mistake later down the line. For example, a United Kingdom-based gamer spent a whopping $10,000 on FIFA ‘17’s and FIFA ‘18’s in-game purchases. And even though his lavish spending didn't have a noticeable effect on his overall finances, he did admit that the entire pursuit wasn't really worth it.

In response to all this madness, United States Sen. Josh Hawley recently introduced a bill called the Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act, which (if passed) will essentially ban “pay-to-win” microtransactions within games that are designed exclusively for a young target audience.

So, how do crypto payments fit into all of this?

As online transactions have gradually become an integral part of the global gaming ecosystem, the past few years have also seen the advent of a new payment avenue for in-game purchases: virtual currencies. The idea was first brought to life back in 2017, a time when the industry as a whole was surging and the price of Bitcoin (BTC) was at its all-time high of nearly $20,000.

Back in 2017, Steam and Twitch were the first big-name platforms to allow their customers to make use of cryptocurrencies (mainly Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash) in order to facilitate their in-game transactions. However, owing to the volatility of this nascent asset class, Steam soon disabled its support for cryptocurrencies within just a couple of months. With that being said, Twitch still accepts a few altcoins, despite the company having briefly relinquished its support for crypto previously in March this year.

Listed below are several platforms that have already become popular among the gaming community and that charge in crypto for the purchase of game-related content or apparel.

— Bitrefill: As the name suggests, Bitrefill is a crypto-trading platform that allows its customers to purchase a wide array of gift cards for online gaming services — such as Steam, Xbox Live and Blizzard’s Battle.net — using Bitcoin. For example, an Xbox gift card worth $15 currently costs 0.0016020 BTC on Bitrefill and a $50 card is available for 0.00534900 BTC.

— Gipsybee: This crypto marketplace allows for the purchase of a host of gaming hardware, such as wireless gamepads, video game consoles, VR headsets and much more. Not only that, the platform currently accepts Bitcoin, Ether and Bitcoin Cash as forms of payment.

— Scan.co.uk: This is a haven for crypto enthusiasts looking to spend their Bitcoin on professional gaming hardware, like niche graphics cards, gaming PCs, RAM cards, DIY water-cooling systems, gaming chairs, GPUs, etc. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that some of the brands whose products are available on the platform include Corsair, Nvidia, 3XS and Intel.

— BMI Gaming: Video game aficionados who still have a thing for arcade gaming may already be familiar with BMI Gaming. The company’s webstore is filled with a number of classic titles, such as Pacman, Luigi’s Mansion, Space Invaders, etc. However, as is to be expected, these arcade machines can cost anywhere between $4,000 and $20,000 (depending on the rarity of the selected game). Payments can be processed via a number of different crypto pathways, including Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.

— Caseking: Similar to Gipsybee, this German firm offers its clientele with a plethora of gaming items, such as GPUs, gaming laptops/PCs, gamepads, joysticks, headsets, etc. However, it is worth pointing out that Caseking’s crypto payment options are currently restricted to just Bitcoin.

Looking ahead

The gaming industry as a whole raked in a mammoth $137 billion last year — which showcases a 13% increase in revenue when compared to 2017. Therefore, as time goes on, more and more game developers might start looking to explore the potential of cryptocurrencies within this burgeoning market space — primarily through the implementation of novel in-game, asset tokenization models.

Additionally, over the course of 2018, blockchain-based games — such as CryptoKitties, My Crypto Heroes and Gods Unchained — were able to generate a combined revenue of around $500 million. And this is quite impressive, considering how nascent this market really is.

And while a lot of people may not necessarily like the idea micropayments, it appears as though this mode of transaction is here to stay. Especially with crypto entering this space, the cost of individual transactions can be reduced quite substantially, thereby allowing developers to subsidize the overall price of their peripheral content (such as downloadable content, skins, etc.). Additionally, crypto assets like Bitcoin can be scaled down quite easily, thereby making it more efficient for gaming companies to process even the tiniest of transactions.

When it comes to individual privacy and security, cryptocurrencies blow traditional credit/debit card-based payment systems out of the water. To provide more context, it is worth remembering that the Equifax data breach, which took place a few years back, resulted in the credit card details of more than 143 million Mastercard and Visa users being leaked online and sold on the darknet.

Lastly, in regard to the crypto gaming boom that is currently being witnessed worldwide, Cointelegraph recently interviewed Morten Rongaard, CEO of Reality Gaming Group, about the future of the video game market. According to Rongaard:

“When talking about the future of the gaming market, the industry continues to catch the attention of not only players of all ages in the economy, but the attention of business owners and investors as well. As an industry, gaming is undergoing impressive growth.”

Rongaard also pointed out that his company was currently in the process of bringing blockchain into the gaming world, saying:",,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-04/bitcoin-investment-scam-steals-thousands-from-canberra-couple/11271742,"Nick Yeomans and his wife Josie thought they had hit the jackpot when a Bitcoin investment they made tripled in six months.

Key points: ACCC says Australians are losing more money to cryptocurrency investment scams

ACCC says Australians are losing more money to cryptocurrency investment scams Canberra couple warns they were drawn into a sophisticated scheme over more than a year

Canberra couple warns they were drawn into a sophisticated scheme over more than a year The couple were able to withdraw thousands of dollars, but lost tens of thousands more

To the amateur investors, the cryptocurrency trader they had found, Coinexx.org, seemed too good to be true.

Slowly, they poured more money into their account, and were met with greater returns. They convinced a family member to match their investment of more than $20,000.

But once they had no more money to give, their fees grew, their returns shrank, and roadblocks were placed between them and their money.

Then they got a message.

""Let me save you the stress, cus (sic.) you've been through a lot already. Coinexx is a scam. Everything and everyone involved are the same,"" it said.

""Don't bother about trying to get back your money. Just focus on getting money to take care of your family.""

After sinking into debt to pay account fees, Mr Yeomans received this message. ( Supplied )

Immediately afterwards the company ceased all communication with them.

""I doubled over, and I just felt sick. I was like, 'we're f***ed'. That's it. That's all I thought,"" Mr Yeomans said.

""We're left here with nothing, with no income, and with lots of debt, the debt has high interest, I thought 'how are we going to get out of this?'

""I just wanted to cry.""

The Canberra couple are among a growing number of Australians falling victim to investment scams lurking behind the volatile cryptocurrency market.

According to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)'s Scamwatch, investment scams involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have increased markedly in 2019.

By May 31 Australians had reported more losses to investment scams mentioning cryptocurrency than they had for all of 2018.

Everything seemed fine at first

Mr Yeomans said he was initially sceptical when introduced to Coinexx.org (not to be confused with Coinexx.com) through a Facebook group.

He decided to risk money on what he was ""expecting to be a scam"".

But, to his surprise, Coinexx took a $1,400 payment and delivered more than $3,700 within six months.

After creating an account, Mr Yeomans was given a login to the company's website, where he could ostensibly monitor his investment's growth.

The Coinexx.org website appears to offer eye-watering returns on investment. ( Coinexx.org )

While at first glance the website appears legitimate, closer inspection raises red flags — pricing plans contain grammatical errors, and the small investment company lists the building that houses the London Aquarium as its headquarters.

But over several months the couple became reliant on payments from the company, Mr Yeomans quit his job, and they restructured their finances around Coinexx.

""From previous experience and what you expect to see or recognise as a scam, a lot of things weren't there,"" Ms Hamill Yeomans said.

""I really didn't expect it to happen for such a long period of time.

""In terms of energy, just putting so much into it. Having the energy to speak to you every day, let you know what's going on, especially when nothing really is going on. It's such an incredible amount of detail to go into.""

'It's hard to believe it's a scam if they're paying you'

As it turned out, the Yeomans family were likely caught up in one of the oldest scams in the book: The Ponzi scheme.

""The description of the scam and text message exchange provided by the victims have the appearance of a Ponzi scheme,"" a spokeswoman for the ACCC said.

However, she said the ACCC had received no complaints about Coinexx.org.

The couple were given a login where they could track their ""investment"". ( ABC News: Jordan Hayne )

Instead of taking their money and growing it legitimately by trading Bitcoin, Coinexx.org instead would likely have paid them a share of other people's investments.

""They build up trust by doing the right thing — by keeping their word up to that point, but it was just such a long period of time,"" Mr Yeomans said.

""It's hard to believe that it is a scam if they're paying you.""

Like many similar schemes, Coinexx.org's account manager encouraged them to join up friends and family members, with the goal of sourcing more money to flow through the scam.

But the couple said, to them, it appeared as though an emerging business was simply trying to generate more customers.

""We were living this lifestyle, that this investment had given us, of course, why wouldn't you want to be able to share that?"" Mr Yeomans said.

Once the couple were bled dry, the scam stung

The couple and a family member had invested more than $43,000 with Coinexx.org, and become reliant on its payments by the time they were suddenly blocked from their money.

It started with a request for an additional withdrawal fee ""to comply with regulations"".

""It all sounded above board, they said 'so that we can comply with the law', and I thought 'that sounds fine, you're complying with the law, I respect that',"" Mr Yeomans said.

The couple, having already sunk their savings into the investment, took out a loan, believing they could pay it back instantly once the fee was paid.

It was the first of several excuses provided by Coinexx.org, and the first of several requests for additional payment — many of which were met.

""When it has become your main source of income, and it's been so reliable as well, you're just trying to think of how you can solve this problem that you're faced with, because you're trying to provide for your family, you're just trying to secure your income,"" Ms Hamill Yeomans said.

By the time they learned they had been sucked into a scam, the family had sold possessions, were behind on their rent and bills, and taken out short-term loans.

They were notified of the scam after the couple sent an email, begging for their funds to be released.

""She sent me a message and said look, 'I just want to save you the stress, this whole thing's a scam, you've been scammed, you're not getting your money back, just try and look after your family',"" Mr Yeomans said.

""It's not just the money that we lost … it's the whole future that we had built on this thing.

""We were building our business, we were expanding, everything was looking really good, it was looking like we were going to be able to take our family on a trip to Japan, and we were going to be able to be self-employed and be able to provide an abundant life for our kids.

""That whole future collapsed.""

The ABC contacted the WhatsApp accounts the Yeomans family dealt with, but did not receive a response. One of the scammers deleted Coinexx branding from their profile after being contacted.

Mr Yeomans said he and his wife had since taken moves to get back on their feet financially.

""We don't have time to feel sorry for ourselves, we've got other people relying on us, we've just got to get to work,"" he said.

""So that's what we did.""",2019-07-04,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kevin-oleary-crypto-crap-is-not-compliant-rogue-currency,"Canadian businessman and TV personality Kevin O'Leary said that cryptocurrencies pose serious compliance challenges to the financial services industry.

During an interview published on July 3, O’Leary said that he would not invest or get involved in cryptocurrencies because of their purportedly unregulated nature:

“If I want to be compliant and I don’t wanna breach any regulators because I’m a participant in financial services globally, and that is where the majority of money is, [...] I have to be compliant, I have no interest in doing any of this crypto crap because it is not compliant.”

O’Leary suggested a hypothetical “regulated” crypto asset based on two or three prominent fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the yen, and the euro or the Swiss franc.

With this asset, O’Leary claims it would be possible to buy equity, pay debt and taxes, and also convert back to the original fiat currency. When it comes to traditional cryptocurrencies, O’Leary said that he does not want to hold any:

“All of this non-compliant stuff… I don’t want to get involved with a drug dealer trading bitcoins somewhere. I want nothing to do with that.”

Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire challenged O’Leary by pointing out that intermediaries between the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the banking system are regulated:

“The crypto industry has been regulated in the U.S. since 2013. If you want to sit between the banking system and cryptocurrency, you have to be licensed as a financial institution.”

O’Leary concluded that, since one cannot pay taxes with cryptocurrencies, they are currently a “rogue currency.”

The TV host has previously expressed his pessimism toward crypto assets. In May, he said that he believes bitcoin (BTC) is a useless currency, since people accepting it want to hedge against its volatility.

Concerns about regulatory clarity and compliance are also shared by the cryptocurrency community. In the United States, regulators are working to better define digital assets so as to promote the industry’s development. In April, Representatives in the House of Representatives reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act, which aims to provide clearer guidelines for blockchain and crypto businesses.",,,,

The news captured international media attention and has dominated headlines for more than two weeks since the official announcement. But if this is the first time hearing of it, welcome to the future where data wasn’t enough and now Facebook wants to control monetary policy, too.

Those of us immersed in the Bitcoin realm have known that Facebook has been working on a cryptocurrency for some time, but it wasn’t until June 18 that we got to see exactly what it would look like. For many of us in this industry, it was more or less what we expected; namely, it’s not really a cryptocurrency and offers none of the benefits of the Bitcoin brand.

What is a cryptocurrency?

Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency best known in pop culture for its wild price swings, is called a cryptocurrency because it employs encryption to process transactions and transfer value. This end-to-end encryption makes transactions highly secure (nigh unbreakable) and irreversible. These transactions are recorded on what is called the blockchain. This technology, the backbone of the Bitcoin network, acts like a digital ledger that keeps an immutable and constantly up-to-date record of all account balances on the network and makes sure no one cheats the system to spend coins they don’t have.

The Bitcoin network’s (capital B) key features are immutability, security, permissionlessness, and decentralization — all transactions are final, the network is effectively impossible to compromise, anyone can use it as freely as the internet itself, and no central entity (like a government or bank) controls it. The network’s currency, bitcoin (lower case b), is scarce and censorship-resistant. Only 21 million bitcoin will ever exist, and the currency is as impractical to police or ban as the internet.

As an endogenous currency for the internet, Bitcoin is also global. Sending bitcoin from Nashville to, say, Seoul, South Korea could take as little as a few minutes depending on the transaction fee the sender sets. By contrast, a bank wire could take as long as a week.

Why Libra fails the test

To grasp the implications of Libra in the wider world of cryptocurrencies, of which there are thousands, it’s vital to understand how Bitcoin operates and why its users see value in a decentralized, non-national monetary system. By highlighting how Bitcoin works alongside Libra, it’s clear that the two have about as much in common as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy does with gold mining — or a corporate powerhouse does with an employee-owned company.

For example, unlike Bitcoin, which is an open system, Libra is closed and will be highly gatekept. Facebook announced the currency in partnership with 27 other major corporations, firms, and non-profits, including Visa, Mastercard, Spotify, Lyft, Uber and Ebay. These Founding Members make up the Libra Association, which will be in charge of processing transactions for the network and maintaining its version of the blockchain. By the coin’s tentative launch in 2020, the project hopes to expand to roughly 100 members.

This means a mere 100 servers, also known as nodes, will maintain the network. By contrast, Bitcoin features something near 11,000 nodes on a global scale to verify and broadcast transactions to the rest of the network. These “full nodes,” as we call them in the industry, are accompanied by “mining nodes,” which provide computing power to order transactions into blockchain and secure the network from attacks. They receive transaction fees and freshly-minted bitcoin from the network as a reward for this service; this coin minting process, which releases freshly mined coins at a set inflation schedule (right now, roughly 2% per annum), is how the network manages a monetary policy without a centralized entity. Together, these nodes construct the decentralized framework that makes Bitcoin so sturdy; if you were to take down or compromise one of these nodes, the network would still be secure because thousands of others are still running the code to support the network.

In no way will Libra be decentralized or offer the protections Bitcoin features by design. With Bitcoin, anyone can run a full or mining node, but with Libra, each Founding Member had to commit a minimum $10 million to have the privilege of joining the network. In the future, any other entity wishing to join the Libra Association will have to pay a similar or perhaps even heftier sum.

So what does running a node entitle these members? Well, besides becoming a sentinel of an entirely new monetary system, they will also receive transaction rewards and dividends from the Libra Reserve. This reserve will include a basket of government-backed assets, such as national currencies, bonds, and securities, whose interest will pay out in dividends to Association Members proportional to their stake in the Libra network.

Sound like a familiar model? If the federation of members, who have the monetary control to issue or redeem Libra coins for national currencies to authorized brokers, didn’t give it away, then the Libra Reserve should drive it home: The Libra Association is basically a corporation-run central bank not unlike the Federal Reserve. Its bank reserves will give the coin a stable value, likely a buck per coin, and each coin will be issued/loaned against this reserve and redeemable by it.

This is yet another major departure from Bitcoin, which isn’t backed by any asset other than itself. Some argue that this means bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and the Libra project explicitly states in its whitepaper that the Libra currency is backed by government-issued assets to inject it with “real” value. But as any Bitcoin proponent will tell you, bitcoin’s nature as a monetary network divorced from state interests is exactly why it is valuable; unlike government issued currency, which can be subject to reckless issuance/inflation and centralized control, bitcoin, like gold, is finite and disrupted in a decentralized manner.

Because Bitcoin it is decentralized, there’s no central authority to control monetary policy or police user activity. No one on the network can block you from participating, no one can keep you from transacting, and no one can freeze your funds. You are the captain of your wallet, the master of your coins.

A centralized network like Libra, however, loses all of these features we associate with cryptocurrencies. The Association will be able to blacklist users they don’t want to service, they will be able to rollback transactions they don’t like, and like a bank, they will have total access to all your financial information: who you paid, when you paid, why you paid, and how much you paid. Given Facebook’s reputation for mismanaging user data and its flippant approach to privacy, an understandable concern from the community and even lawmakers has been, “Can we trust Facebook with our money and its related data?”

Hijacking the crypto narrative

If Libra isn’t quashed by regulators before it launches, the market will decide where to place its trust and whether it will value convenience over privacy and financial self-sovereignty. Libra has waxed poetic about creating an inclusive, border-transcending monetary system that will serve both the the world’s unbanked and the economically privileged alike. Facebook took a page right out of Bitcoin’s playbook with this one, because this is exactly the impact Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator(s), Satoshi Nakamoto, heralded upon its launch in 2009: a parallel monetary system that exists outside of the traditional framework and that is borderless, free for anyone to join, and is extremely difficult for governments to censor. With Bitcoin, you are your own bank.

Libra has hijacked this narrative without offering any of the features that the narrative was built on. It is highly centralized, can bar people from using it as a means of exchange, and will make it very easy for governments to trace transactions and to disenfranchise users they don’t want on the network. With Libra, you’re not the bank; it is. It’s a glorified IOU for the dollar and other national currencies masquerading as a cryptocurrency whose “blockchain” will likely resemble something more akin to a cloud database than the real thing.

As such, its main competitor, ironically, is the banking industry. With Libra, Facebook and friends have opened up a new monetary front. For the first time since the Wildcat Banking of the 1800s, the Austrian ideal for privately-issued currency competition is yet again a possibility. With Libra, people now have an additional option alongside the state’s monopoly over currency issuance.

If you’re using Libra, the new boss is the same as the old boss; they just work in the corporate offices of Silicon Valley instead of the member banks of the Federal Reserve.

Bitcoin could rise above $12,000 with the daily chart reporting a bullish reversal.

A high-volume bullish breakout on the hourly chart indicates scope for a rise to the bearish lower high at $12,448.

BTC could yet post losses today, however, if prices find acceptance below key support at $11,385.

Bitcoin (BTC) looks set to close in the green on U.S. Independence Day for the fifth consecutive year, having recovered nearly 25 percent from recent lows.

The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose 1.17, 1.79, 3.35 and 1.67 percent on July 4 in 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, according to Bitstamp data.

BTC’s Independence Day performance in the years prior to 2015 is mixed. Prices saw little change in 2012, rose 3.16 percent in 2013 and suffered a 2.63 percent loss in 2014.

All-in-all, bitcoin, considered by some observers as an anti-establishment asset, has put on a good show on the U.S. Independence Day in five out of the last seven years.

The cryptocurrency now appears poised to extend the four-year winning trend, as the recovery from recent lows seems to be gathering traction and the short duration charts are now flashing bullish signals.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,600, representing 4 percent gains on a 24-hour basis, having hit a high of $12,061 earlier today. At that price, the cryptocurrency was up more than $2,400, or 25 percent, from the July 21 low of $9,614.

Hourly chart

BTC jumped 4 percent in 60 minutes late on Wednesday, confirming an upside break of the symmetrical triangle – a bullish continuation pattern – on the hourly chart.

Notably, the breakout was backed by a sharp rise in buy volumes (green bars). In fact, buy volume climbed to its highest since July 1, invalidating the bearish volume divergence represented by the falling trendline.

Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side and prices could rise toward the bearish lower high of $12,448 created on June 26.

While the momentum has cooled somewhat in the last 10 hours, the minor price pullback seems to have taken the shape of a bull flag – a pause that often restarts with upwards momentum.

The probability of BTC posting daily gains with a UTC close above today’s opening price of $12,061 would drop if the price finds acceptance below $11,385 – the low of yesterday’s high-volume bullish candle (horizontal line).

That, however, looks unlikely, as the daily chart is reporting a bullish candlestick pattern.

Daily chart

BTC rose 10.5 percent on Wednesday, marking a strong follow-through to the dip demand highlighted by the preceding day’s bullish hammer candle.

The candlestick pattern indicates the pullback likely ended at $9,614 and thus prices could continue to rise toward the recent high of $13,880.

Bitcoin has had a volatile week. Bitcoin was trading at over $13,000 on June 26 and under $10,000 on July 2. Bitcoin is currently trading at just over $11,850, and some analysts think BTC could rally significantly today as it is Independence Day in the United States. Crypto analytics website SFOX reported that holidays in the midst of a bull market tend to spark FOMO, a trend apparently supported by Google Trends data:

“At times when the market is already doing well or improving, holidays have the potential to drive renewed retail interest in buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. That behavior, almost by definition, is FOMO: buying into an asset because one sees it trending upward and wants to benefit from it.”

Top altcoin ETH is currently trading sideways at around $300. Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance recently announced that it was moving off the Omni standard and onto ERC-20 for its Tether (USDT) addresses. The exchange Poloniex also added support for Ethereum-based USDT, citing a cheaper and faster process for transactions and deposits.

Ripple is mostly trading sideways, with some minor losses at press time of approximately 1%. However, XRP has trended down significantly since its monthly highs on June 22 and June 26, seeing approximately a 15% correction from those peaks. XRP is trading just shy of $.40 at press time.

Ripple’s incubatory subsidiary Xpring recently announced that it has dedicated $500 million to XRP projects with since the coin’s inception. The investment group reportedly intends to bolster the infrastructure for XRP, as well as support innovative ripple projects.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, LINK saw a 26% on-the-day gain on June 28. Coinbase Pro had announced support for the smart contract token on June 27, as well as announcing full trading support for the LINK/ETH pair on June 28.

From lawmakers and economists to financial regulators and consumer groups, virtually all are worried that Facebook’s crypto could impinge on privacy and facilitate financial crimes.

Marcus also confirmed that he will testify before the US Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee in the next few weeks. While Facebook portrays its crypto as digital deliverance for the world’s unbanked, the company has offered few answers to some of the most pressing concerns. These include the possibilities of theft, money laundering, and default of the reserves meant to back Libra.

Although US and European policymakers appear well aware of Libra’s risks, there’s been little discussion of non-Western perspectives on Facebook’s crypto. In particular, the Russian attitude could be important because the country’s government has a checkered history with bitcoin, allegedly using it to fund interference in the 2016 US election. Interestingly, Russia seems unperturbed by Libra.

“No one is going to ban it,” said Alexei Moiseev, Russia’s deputy finance minister on July 1. It appears Russia will treat Libra like bitcoin, or any other digital asset. Russian crypto regulation is forthcoming and it may legalize cryptocurrency trading, but Moiseev explained, “The ruble is our national currency, and all calculations must be made in it.”

Russia is clearly not Libra’s target market—in November, Facebook said it only had 6.2 million users in Russia, a fraction of the 60 million (or more) Russians who use Vkontakte, another social media site. Still, unless the Libra network is geofenced, it could be accessible to Russian users. As such, it’s worth considering potential misuse, especially given the Russian security apparatus’ past use of bitcoin.

In April, the Mueller Report confirmed agents in Russia’s military intelligence service used bitcoin to finance operations related to the 2016 email hack of the Democratic National Committee. Russian nationals, like Alexander Vinnik—suspected of laundering billions of dollars through BTC-e, a cryptocurrency exchange—have further been linked to bitcoin usage. The country has also been a hotbed for initial coin offerings, an often-fraudulent fundraising method in which supposed entrepreneurs solicit cryptocurrency investments.

Bitcoin and Libra aren’t all that different under the hood, so there’s a realistic concern that bad actors might abuse Facebook’s crypto, too. Technically, Facebook’s proposal for the Libra network is very similar to bitcoin because both would allow anyone to send or receive digital funds, without government-issued identification or a bank account. The difference arises in that Libra would be redeemable for normal currencies, like the US dollar and euro, and because of that peg, Libra won’t face bitcoin’s volatility. Price certainty and a (potential) absence of ID requirements could make Libra attractive to money launderers.

Russia is the main source for money laundering in Europe, explained Anders Åslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank. He noted that Russia presently lacks significant crypto regulation, and worried that Libra might serve as a boon to financial criminals.

Bitcoin—and perhaps Libra—should be prohibited around the world because of the threat of money laundering, Åslund said. He also indicated that Facebook’s compliance with know-your-customer (KYC) requirements from US regulators would be crucial. It seems, he said, like they just want to jump over the issue.

Compared to the US and Europe, Russia is less concerned about protecting its economy, observed Katharina Pistor, director for the center on global legal transformation at Columbia University. It will be difficult for any government to exercise authority over the Libra Association, the Swiss nonprofit Facebook has established to oversee the Libra network and reserves, she said.

“The real concern for me is the scale,” said Pistor. While Russia is of consequence—and could attempt to infiltrate the network—she expressed even greater concern about the reserves that will eventually undergird the Libra. “There’s a scarcity of safe assets,” Pistor explained. She worried that Facebook and the Libra Association may relax standards for Libra’s underlying reserves, accepting “just safe enough,” like bonds below investment grade. As in the subprime mortgage crisis, the Libra is only as good as the assets it represents.

At the risk of sounding like an alarmist, Facebook’s Libra raises concerns about global financial stability and crime. Russia’s pedestrian response to Libra should probably read as an additional warning. Perhaps Facebook ought to return to the drawing board.

Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing themself.",,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/4/20682109/bitcoin-energy-consumption-annual-calculation-cambridge-index-cbeci-country-comparison,"Bitcoin consumes more energy than the entire nation of Switzerland, according to new estimates published by researchers at the University of Cambridge.

An online tool that launched this week called the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, or CBECI, estimates how much energy is needed to maintain the Bitcoin network in real time, before using this to calculate its annual energy usage.

Currently, the CBECI says the global Bitcoin network is consuming more than seven gigwatts of electricity. Over the course of a year that’s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt hours of energy consumption. That’s more than the country of Switzerland uses over the same time period (58 TWh per year), but less than Colombia (68 TWh per year).

It means Bitcoin accounts for roughly 0.25 percent of the world’s entire electricity consumption. That’s as much energy as all the tea kettles in the UK use over 11 years. It also means that the electricity wasted each year by always-on but inactive electronic devices in the US could power the Bitcoin network four times over.

“We want to use comparisons that set the narrative,” one of the co-creators of the CBECI, Michel Rauchs, told BBC News. ”Visitors to the website can make up their own mind as to whether it seems large or small.”

It’s well established that Bitcoin requires a huge amount of electricity, used by miners around the world running the computer hardware necessary to maintain the network and validate payments. But it’s also worth remembering these figures are very much estimates.

“Reliable estimates of Bitcoin’s electricity usage are rare”

In a blog post announcing the new index, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which oversaw the work, makes the same observation. “Reliable estimates of Bitcoin’s electricity usage are rare: in most cases, they only provide a one-time snapshot and the numbers often show substantial discrepancies from one model to another,” it says.

This uncertainty is reflected by the CBECI’s inclusion of lower and upper bounds for its estimates. The lower bound is currently around 22 TWh while the upper bound is just under 150 TWh. (Though these figures may have changed since the time of publication).

It’s a significant spread, and it suggests that exact comparisons between different estimates should be taken with a pinch of salt. Another popular estimate of the cryptocurrency’s energy usage maintained by Digiconomist pegs the network’s yearly consumption at 70 TWh, for example — six TWh greater than the University of Cambridge’s CBECI. You can read more about the exact methodology used to calculate the CBECI here.

Regardless of the exact figures, the energy usage of Bitcoin is certainly eyebrow raising. It’s increased rapidly, sometimes doubling in less than six months, and this sort of energy usages comes with a significant carbon footprint. Though, again, exact estimates of this environmental impact vary significantly because of the difficulty of determining how the electricity used to power Bitcoin’s mining hardware is generated.

The cryptocurrency also looks unwieldy in terms of day to day utility. Alex de Vries, a Bitcoin expert at PwC, told BBC News that the network processes fewer than 100 million transactions per year, a “completely insignificant” figure compared to the 500 billion payments processed by the traditional financial industry. de Vries estimates that Bitcoin uses more energy per transaction than all the rest of the world’s banks combined.",2019-07-04,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-bitcoin-market-cap-due-to-surpass-1-trillion-this-cycle-8-trillion-next/,"Crypto asset market analyst and partner at Adaptive Capital, Willy Woo, believes that the market capitalisation of Bitcoin alone will surpass $1 trillion dollars in the coming years. After letting off steam, he believes the next cycle will take Bitcoin’s market capitalisation to levels that rival that of gold today in terms of value.

The analyst also takes a rather unique, hyper extended view of Bitcoin. He consider the asset in the wider context of money and sees crypto as the beginning of “the digital age”.

Could Bitcoin Hit $50,000 by 2022?

Appearing on the Coinist Podcast earlier today, trader and Bitcoin optimist Willy Woo spoke about his current outlook on the crypto asset industry.

After discussion relating to his work with Adaptive Capital and his research into on-chain trading signals, Woo speculated on the future of Bitcoin. In response to a question about whether his much earlier call in which he stated that Bitcoin’s market capitalisation would reach that of gold by 2024, the analyst stated that he now felt it to be a little soon. Woo first made the call in 2012 when he was very new to the very new Bitcoin industry,

He stated that Bitcoin currently has another two to three years left of upside during the ongoing market cycle and that it will be during the bullish phase following a another lull that BTC surpasses gold as the planet’s primary store of value asset.

However, that’s not to say that this bullish cycle will not be impressive. The Adaptive partner believes that the price of Bitcoin will approach $50,000 at some point in the next few years. This will put its market capitalisation at around $1 trillion.

The 10,000 Year View of Money

Perhaps the most interesting portion of the interview comes during Woo’s closing thoughts. Taking a much longer view of Bitcoin, set in the context of the technology of money itself, Woo claims that Bitcoin represents the dawning of a new age in civilisation.

Bitcoin 10k year view with @woonomic: ""Crypto is money, & money has been around since Civilization has been around… Bankers say it's a bubble.

Technologist call it a disruption.

But, students of history would call it the dawn of a digital age."" ??: https://t.co/dwnWaEXZ3F pic.twitter.com/3b3Ysxwnio — CoinistPodcast (@CoinistPodcast) July 4, 2019

As we moved from hunter-gatherer societies, into agrarianism, industrialism, and beyond, the forms of money new technology makes possible and the requirements of money in ever-expanding communities slowly shift. Seashells were replaced by gold because it was a harder money, and gold was replaced by bank notes (backed by gold) because they were more useful in wider commerce.

Woo believes that the first digitally scarce asset, Bitcoin, is a crucial step forward for humans:

“If we’re in a digital age, we really want a digital currency and this is our first native digital currency… Bankers call [Bitcoin] a bubble, technologists call it a disruption, but students of history would call it the dawn of the digital age.”

In an interview with BloxLive.tv on July 2, he said the basic principle behind his forecast was classic supply-demand economics — still valid for the innovative digital asset class.

One of the largest drivers of continued price appreciation will be bitcoin’s halving — when mining rewards will be reduced by half — in May 2020, he said.

Meanwhile, most institutional investors aren’t even aware of this looming reduction in supply, he noted, suggesting that what will continue to drive the market from the perspective of sentiment will be a “continuation of trends we’re already seeing.”

These include increasing legitimization of the space, inflows of institutional capital, record trading volumes, and a climate of global instability that promotes recognition of bitcoin as a safe haven asset.

“Time is bitcoin’s greatest advocate,” Pomp added, and as these trends continue, he said his current 70-75% confidence level in $100,000 by 2021 will hit 90%:

“In August of last year I predicted bitcoin would go down to $3,000 before returning to $10,000. It essentially did that [...] Now I think it’s going to $100,000, but [...] there will be more volatility: there will be parabolic runs like we saw in June and then there will be 20-30% drawdowns from that. Along the way a lot of people will call the top at these local highs — they’ll be incorrect.”

Elaborating on the question of legitimization, Pomp agreed with the notion that Facebook’s entry into the space with Libra is a bullish sign. “People may not like Zuckerberg, but no one thinks he’s dumb,” he quipped, proposing that:

“Bitcoin will benefit from libra being a “gateway drug” for cryptocurrencies.”

It’s not so much a question of the token itself, he noted, but the digital wallet that will be rolled out alongside it, which will be a fantastic on-ramp not only for Libra, but potentially in future also other cryptocurrencies, tokenized securities, and even data.

Just yesterday, crypto merchant bank pioneer Mike Novogratz said he won’t be selling the next time bitcoin hits $14,000, anticipating its spectacular rally will see its value going much higher.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-company-gives-individuals-a-chance-to-mine-bitcoin-without-sky-high-energy-bills,"With demand for Bitcoin on the rise in response to soaring prices of late, attention is increasingly being turned to mining.

However, the market has changed from the early days of cryptocurrency, when Bitcoin was in plentiful supply, as few knew about the opportunity and high mining rewards could be gained by individuals using a small setup at home.

These days, an unhelpful combination of fierce competition, algorithmic difficulties and high maintenance costs often mean it’s economically unviable to fly solo when mining crypto. In response, a novel alternative has emerged for those who are reluctant to purchase expensive equipment and pay astronomical electricity bills: cloud mining powered by remote data centers.

“Affordable and fuss-free”

Hashing24 says its remote Bitcoin mining services give consumers a chance to lease hashing power from industry-leading data centers that have already done the heavy lifting by investing in their own hi-tech equipment for mining cryptocurrencies — predominantly Bitcoin.

According to the company, this approach can help solve the dilemma that many individual miners are facing at home. PCs and graphics processing units are not enough to cut through the noise in this increasingly advanced industry — and any revenue generated through mining is often outweighed by the cost of the energy it took to get there.

Hashing24 is available here

This isn’t the only hurdle on the horizon, as it can often prove near impossible for a single computer to compete with expansive mining pools, in which groups of miners combine their computing hash rates and distribute any proceeds between themselves. Although this could seem like a tempting proposition, Hashing24 claims this approach also has its downsides, as there are times when participants are not rewarded equally for their efforts.

As an alternative, remote mining services can enable individuals to enter into agreements with data centers that know what they are doing. Pricing is delivered in the form of a contract — and from here, the mining process is somewhat comparable to ordering a new pair of shoes from Amazon. Hashing24 sends the mining order to huge processing centers based across Europe, which use equipment with a 100% uptime, and minted coins are delivered on a daily basis.

Is it practical?

According to Hashing24, remote mining is not something that is to be embarked on lightly — and there are a multitude of factors that individuals need to take into account. A provider’s reputation, length of service and the technology they rely upon can all prove crucial in ensuring that consumers aren’t left out of pocket. It’s also important for those who lease mining capacity to do the math and devise detailed financial plans that weigh up revenue against cost. The length of a mining contract, when coupled with the constant issue of volatility in cryptocurrency prices, can place a significant strain on budgets and affect the end result. Maintenance fees also need to be considered — and depending on the provider, this charge could be weaved into a contract’s price or deducted when coins are minted.

Hashing24 says one way of weighing up the costs and benefits can be through using a mining calculator, which takes a multitude of factors into account to provide a projection of potential returns in the future. Demo mining can also be used to see how strategies would work in a simulated environment.

Hashing24’s partner — Bitfury — has data centers based in Canada, Norway, Iceland and Georgia. The company says that it uses the newest Application-Specific Integrated Circuits — otherwise known as ASICs, for short. This is coupled with the latest air and immersion cooling technology to guarantee performance while mitigating costs.

At first glance, Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency doesn’t make sense.

On its face, it is a non-speculative token which uses enough decentralization to make it difficult if not impossible for Facebook to profit off it as the company does from its social media platform.

But in crypto, there is always an upside to the people who launch a new protocol, in the event the protocol succeeds and even in many cases for simply having started development of the project.

This article deals specifically and exclusively with that upside, admittedly handwaving aside many other potential issues with the protocol, to be addressed elsewhere.

Libra users

It’s important to realize that Facebook is actually launching two cryptocurrencies: the one everyone’s talking about (Libra) and the one available only to Facebook and its corporate partners (the Libra investment token).

The former will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies and cash equivalents, which means that for every dollar of Libra in existence, there will be (in theory) a “dollar” worth of real-world assets which that token may be exchanged for under certain conditions.

As a normal user, you’d get $100 worth of Libra by spending $100. Your Libra can (again, in theory) be used across a variety of platforms or sent to an approved friend.

The Libra Association (a Swiss not-for-profit) puts your $100 into a variety of low-risk, short-term investments like U.S. Treasury bills. As of July 1, the one-month T-bill was yielding 2.125 percent on an annualized basis, so the association would earn $2 and change on your $100 Libra purchase.

What happens to that money?

Libra investors

Those funds are controlled and spent by the Libra Association. According to the white paper, funds are used first to fund the operation of the network with the remainder being divided among the Libra Investment Token holders according to their holdings, with policies determined by the association.

The association itself is made up of holders of the Libra investment token who invested a minimum of $10 million, as well as “special impact groups” selected by the association to have a vote but who don’t have to buy the investment token.

From the white paper:

“How will the reserve be invested? Users of Libra do not receive a return from the reserve. The reserve will be invested in low-risk assets that will yield interest over time. The revenue from this interest will first go to support the operating expenses of the association — to fund investments in the growth and development of the ecosystem, grants to nonprofit and multilateral organizations, engineering research, etc. Once that is covered, part of the remaining returns will go to pay dividends to early investors in the Libra Investment Token for their initial contributions. Because the assets in the reserve are low risk and low yield, returns for early investors will only materialize if the network is successful and the reserve grows substantially in size.” [Emphasis added]

Early investors are primarily large technology and VC companies, for whom $10 million isn’t actually a huge investment.

The big numbers come into play when you look at what success, big or small, would look like for the investors, at which point suddenly the project makes sense.

Size of the pie

To size up Libra’s potential market, let’s look at the U.S. money supply as tracked by the Federal Reserve.

In January 2019, M1 (which includes cash, coins, and money in checking accounts) stood at $3.7 trillion, in a country of about 329 million people. This compares against M2 at more than $14 trillion, which is everything in M1 plus savings accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit and other bank deposits.

Assume that after a couple of years Libra has achieved adoption equal to 10 percent of M1. We’ll also assume that by this time Libra has sold $1 billion worth of the investment token and that it costs $1 billion a year to run the network and manage the fund’s investments. And we’ll assume T-bill rates hold constant.

After those expenses, Libra would be generating almost $7 billion of interest per year, with a yearly return on investment (ROI) of 688.51 percent.

Remember, it’s the investment token holders who are reaping this return, not the Libra currency holders, who earn no interest on their collateral. The former group, in aggregate, have put in a much smaller amount of money than the latter – which is why they get such eye-popping yields from a portfolio of low-risk instruments.

Stealth returns

Over ten years, a hypothetical investment of $500 would return dividends of $34,425.35, assuming zero adoption beyond that initial 10 percent of M1. Of course, you can’t just invest $500, since the minimum threshold for investment tokens is $10 million – which, in this scenario, returns $688 million.

And that’s the conservative scenario.

The craziness here becomes even more apparent looking at our “middle of the road” scenario, where we assume that Libra would see adoption equivalent to 15 percent of the more inclusive money supply figure M2.

Yearly returns spike to 4,478 percent with $44.7 billion in net gain to investors. That hypothetical $500 investment returns $223,924.45 over 10 years and the $10 million minimum investment nets $4.4 billion over 10 years – still assuming zero new adoption

Market share takeover

In our “Partial Global Adoption” scenario, we use 25 percent of U.S. M2 as the stand-in for 10 percent to 15 percent of global M2. Yearly returns surge to 7,530% with net returns of just over $75 billion. Returns for $500 would hypothetically be $376,540, while $10 million buy-in nets investors a cool $7.53 billion.

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) takes honors in a recent report as the largest bank in the world with a whopping $3.47 trillion in assets. Banks haven’t had a market share challenger to their centuries-old oligopoly until now.

If Libra grabs a 25 percent market share of the U.S. M2 money supply, it would be the world’s “No. 1 bank.” It could achieve the same thing with a much lower percentage than that of the global money supply.

It’s taken ICBC almost 35 years to reach global dominance and Libra could hack that timeline and be the fastest all-time to reach number one.

The derivative opportunity

This is, of course, only the currency side of the opportunity. A longtime Holy Grail of cryptocurrency, not to speak of markets generally, has been the creation of a “trustless,” tokenized, collateralized assets and derivatives marketplace.

In any Libra success scenario, we can be assured that Libra-collateralized assets will quickly follow. Doing so opens up the next phase of the speculative opportunity with the potential for exponential returns far beyond the examples above.

Derivative, collateralized markets could represent hundreds of trillions of dollars of additional capital to the Libra system.

Supra-national digital currency

Libra is in a very real way, different. To longtime bitcoin users and advocates, it is both a beautiful and terrifying thing.

Part of cryptocurrency’s promise is the introduction of unstoppable competition in money. While governments have long maintained a tightly held monopoly on the issuance and management of regional and reserve currencies, that reality is largely by nature of there being no better, pervasively accepted alternatives.

Libra could very quickly change all of that.



On a recent episode of Let’s Talk Bitcoin!, co-host Andreas M. Antonopoulos observed:

“…This makes [Libra] look like a kind of Neo-IMF [International Monetary Fund]. A new model for an IMF that is based on consumer or retail banking, with reserves built up by consumers but which will give them the ability to do things very similar to what the IMF does. “If I’m a central banker, or if I’m a government politician or someone who works in the finance ministry of say, France or India, I would look at this and say ‘Dear God; at some point [Libra] will be able to come in, not only buy up our bonds, but then hold us over a barrel’ and dictate to small countries, until eventually it can dictate to medium countries, then large countries…”

Facebook is, right now, the dominant player in social media with more than 2 billion users on a planet of around 7.7 billion. This enormous scale comes with incredible power and lots of scrutiny. While its ability to hold the high ground in years and decades to come is an open question, few would doubt the depth of the company’s resources today, whether financial, technological or the sheer number of eyeballs served.

Libra seems like a way to capitalize on Facebook’s dominance of today’s social media (and its partners’ industries) to kick-start a real, global network effect around a supra-national digital currency.

If even a fraction of Facebook’s user base converts to Libra, it’s on the path to becoming the largest and most profitable “financial institution” (albeit decentralized) in the world.

Bitcoin basher Peter Schiff has been quietly holding some of the biggest cryptocurrency. Schiff, who is a gold bug, has been incessantly cranky on crypto and recently characterized bitcoin investors as “dumb.” The shoe is on the other foot now, as it turns out the Shiff, who is the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, received roughly $100 worth of bitcoin as a gift and has been holding it ever since.

Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony Pompliano brought it up on Twitter, and Schiff didn’t deny it, deciding instead to provide more details. This inspired Pompliano to offer to send the crypto skeptic more bitcoin. After one failed attempt, Schiff found his BTC wallet address and tweeted it.

I own about $100 worth. It was a gift. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 5, 2019

He has since racked up some $500 worth of bitcoin, all before the stock market even opened.

Meanwhile, his precious commodity gold has been almost as volatile as bitcoin. The gold price rose above the psychologically important 1,400 level at the beginning of the week only to fall back below it. Gold just lost more of its luster.

After U.S. jobs data came in better than economists were expecting for June, investors found less of a reason to invest in the safe haven and the gold price dropped. Schiff is still crying recession and he expects the Fed to cut rates, which he says would “boost inflation.”

Mark Mobius on Bitcoin

Gold bulls are skeptical about bitcoin because it threatens to take market share away from the precious metal, not to mention the coveted title as a store of value. Wall Street veteran Mark Mobius is another gold investor. He told Bloomberg that he “loves gold,” particularly in a market in which interest rates are falling.

Like Schiff, Mobius is open to owning some digital gold, but he remains a no-coiner for the moment, telling Bloomberg about his reservations. But Mobius, who is at the helm of Mobius Capital partners, is stuck on the fact that bitcoin hasn’t made its way into the mainstream yet and isn’t “widely used,” citing the common misconception –

“…except in a lot of illicit activity, a lot of the drug transactions and things like that are taking place with cryptocurrencies.”

Regulators around the world are cracking down on illegal activity surrounding crypto with a focus on anti-money laundering policies. Mobius is not a buyer – yet – but he’s not ruling it out, either.

“At the end of the day, there are many people who do believe in it. And if it continues and grows, then I would probably have to be a buyer and be involved in this.”

With the upcoming launch of regulated bitcoin futures exchange Bakkt, price discovery for bitcoin will improve, which should appease Mobius. Two major gold bugs are warming up to bitcoin.

Major cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Poloniex announced they were both moving their Tether addresses from Omni.

Tether addresses switching from Omni to ERC-20

While Bitcoin dominance over the cryptocurrency market is undisputed, Bitcoin-based protocols are slowly becoming less popular. The increase in adoption pushes transaction numbers way higher than what protocols such as Omni, an open-source asset platform on the Bitcoin blockchain, can handle, which is why many traffic-heavy cryptocurrencies have begun moving their coins to other platforms.

Tether (USDT) is the biggest and most notable company that has started to abandon the Bitcoin-based Omni protocol in favor of the more efficient Ethereum. Anthony Sassano, an Ethereum developer and head of marketing at Set Protocol, pointed out that the number of USDT as ERC-20 on Ethereum has significantly increased, and is now up to almost 40 percent of the total amount of USDT on Omni.

According to Tether’s ‘transparency’ page, the company currently has around $2.8 billion USDT in circulation on Omni. The protocol also holds very little fiat currency, with a balance of just over €1,600 currently on Omni. However, there is over $1.1 billion in USDT currently on Ethereum, as well as more than €50 million.

Sassano said it was very likely that the majority of USDT in circulation will live on Ethereum instead of Omni.

Major exchanges abandoning Bitcoin in favor of ERC-20

Tether isn’t the only one migrating USDT from Omni. Some of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world have already begun switching to ERC-20 based addresses for Tether’s stablecoin.

On July 3, Binance announced that Ethereum’s ERC-20 based addresses will be standard from now on when it comes to USDT. Apart from a 30-minute downtime for USDT withdrawals and deposits, the switch was relatively smooth. However, Binance noted that users will not be able to withdraw Omni-based USDT from their accounts from now on, but Omni-based USDT deposits will still be available.

Cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex announced it will begin supporting ERC-20 based USDT deposits on the same day. Users will also still be able to deposit and withdraw USDT from Omni addresses, the exchange said, alongside Tron and Ethereum-based tokens.

Cryptocurrency tracking instruments traded on established equity exchanges allow institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Now there is a new option to invest in bitcoin cash (BCH) with an exchange traded product in one of the most advanced markets in the world. Under the ticker ABCH, bitcoin cash is the sixth Amun crypto-asset tracker listed on the Swiss stock exchange Six.

Bitcoin Cash Exchange Traded Product

Amun AG, a Swiss fintech company aiming to facilitate access to crypto asset investments, announced on Friday, July 5 that it has listed the first exchange traded product (ETP) tracking the performance of bitcoin cash (BCH). Founded in 1850, Six is Switzerland’s principal stock exchange. It offers traders securities including Swiss government bonds as well as derivatives such as stock options.

The Amun Bitcoin Cash ETP is a fully collateralized product that is denominated in US dollars and has an annual investor fee of 2.5% that includes custody, insurance, and re-balancing fees. This new crypto investment instrument is seeded by Roger Ver with 25,000 BCH, worth more than $10 million as of today.

The flow of institutional money into digital assets of all kinds over the past few years has helped the new market mature, granting it similar status to investment categories such as stocks and other equities. By giving investors another option to profit from the success of bitcoin cash, this new tool will also support cryptocurrency becoming mainstream as more people are exposed to it financially.

Headquartered in Zurich, Amun was established in 2018 and is led by a team of serial entrepreneurs and experienced professionals from the asset management industry. It employs an institutional grade security and custody solution using a variety of safety measures including cold storage, multiple private keys, whitelisting and audit trails to hold the underlying crypto assets.

“As Bitcoin Cash is becoming a game changer in the crypto space and beyond, I believe Amun has the credential to carry out our objective, a global adoption of Bitcoin Cash. We are confident that our investment in the new Amun BCH ETP will set the example and drive more investors to join the growing community which believes in the success of Bitcoin Cash,” explained Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver.

Six Swiss Exchange Leads With Crypto ETPs

This launch of the BCH exchange traded product follows the listing in the past nine months of five ETPs by Amun for trading on Six. These cover the top 10 cryptocurrencies with the Amun Bitwise Select 10 Large Cap Crypto Index ETP (KEYS), the top five cryptocurrencies with the Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP (HODL), as well as three individual asset trackers on bitcoin (ABTC), ethereum (AETH) and ripple (AXRP).

Hany Rashwan, Amun Co-Founder and CEO, commented: “We are delivering our strategy, which is to provide investors with the wider product suite in the crypto-assets space, easily available on one of the most reputable market place, the Swiss Exchange. Thanks to this product, investors can now easily add Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to their portfolio.”

Given the occasional confusion between ETPs and ETFs (exchange traded funds), it is important to note that while the two instruments have technical similarities, they are legally two different products, and are listed under different categories on Six Swiss Exchange. When the matter popped up last year the exchange clarified that: ”ETPs are collateralized, noninterest-earning bearer debt securities which replicate an underlying [asset] (generally from the commodities sector), either on a regular or leveraged basis. Like ETFs, they trade in a multi market-making segment, but in legal terms they are not funds.”

Not satisfied with merely serving as a hub for investing in crypto assets tracking products, Six is also looking for additional ways to benefit from the innovation underpinning cryptocurrency. Earlier this year the chairman of the exchange, Romeo Lacher, announced Six’s intention to launch a new market powered by blockchain technology during the second half of 2019. The venue, to be called the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), is expected to initially run parallel to Six’s legacy exchange platform.

By incorporating distributed ledger technology, transactions on SDX will only require a single step and can be completed in less than a second, whereas the legacy platform requires three processes that can take up to several days to finish. Lacher also stated at the time that the exchange is hoping to conduct a security token offering.

The Swiss Advantage

The launch of this bitcoin cash exchange traded product is the latest example of how Switzerland is well ahead of most other countries in terms of crypto finance. For centuries the country was known around the world for its tradition of banking secrecy, but now the cryptocurrency industry has taken root in the country.

Cryptocurrency foundations, community organizations and entrepreneurs have all helped put the lightly populated Swiss canton of Zug on the business world’s map as ‘Crypto Valley’. This is mainly because the local administration has created one of the most welcoming environments for the industry, in contrast to much more restrictive jurisdictions such as the U.S. where many businesses complain innovation is discouraged by heavy-handed regulations.

The latest example of this trend is of course Facebook establishing the foundation for managing its Libra coin in Switzerland, which American politicians see as a possible threat to the hegemony of the U.S. dollar.

Last week during the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance annual conference, the prominent research group unveiled a unique tracking platform that monitors energy consumption of Bitcoin – the worlds most popular cryptocurrency.

The new index was announced by Michel Rauchs, the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Lead at CCAF. Rauchs, an expert in all things crypto, has published several well regarded empirical studies on blockchain (DLT) and cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin uses a “Proof of Work” (PoW) methodology to mint or mine new Bitcoins. This cryptomining process entails the use of computers attempting to solve an equation and thus “earn” a Bitcoin. As Bitcoin is currently worth about USD $11,000.00 – if you get the answer right you get to keep that bounty. China, a place where cryptocurrency is officially banned, is perhaps the biggest crypto mining jurisdiction in the world.

Over time, the mining process has migrated away from hobbyists operating their own mining nodes to highly professional mining farms scattered around the world competing to earn free money; except the virtual currency is not really free as it costs considerable sums to operate these farms – most of it in electricity bills.

Bitcoin, and those individuals and corporations that mine the crypto, have come under scrutiny and criticism for the amount of energy used in creating the crypto. The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) provides a “real-time estimate of the total electricity load and consumption of the Bitcoin network.” While acknowledging that the exact amount of energy utilized cannot be determined, the CBECI is probably the best real-time estimate of Bitcoin mining energy usage in existence.

So what does the Index tell us?

According to their numbers, annualized consumption stands at a whopping 60.45 TWh. That’s a big number, but to most of us, this measurement means little until you draw some comparisons which Cambridge provides.

Bitcoin mining uses more energy than the entire country of Switzerland in a single year (and just under the Czech Republic). Bitcoin energy consumption also tops Greece and Israel.

The amount of electricity utilized by BTC in a single year could power all of the Tea Kettles in Europe for two years (currently this includes the UK).

The electricity used by Bitcoin mining could satisfy all of the energy needs of the University of Cambridge for 343 years.

Bitcoin uses 0.24% of all electricity production globally and 0.28% of all electricity consumption

Cambridge adds that it is important for Bitcoin to be “inefficient.” It is this inefficiency that prevents a “single entity or colluding group of actors to easily gain control and dominate the network.”

Other Bitcoin defenders will ask the question as to how much energy does the traditional financial system consume? And what about gold mining?

The exploration and uncovering of gold takes massive investment and plenty of energy consumption. Bitcoin proponents frequently compare the favored crypto to being a gold like digital asset.

Additionally, at some point in the future, the mining of Bitcoin will end – because it is capped at a certain amount. The “Halving” (as it is called) is an event that takes place every four years when mining rewards are cut in half. This event has already happened three times with the fourth expected to take place next year.

As the supply of Bitcoin is limited, some people expect the value to rise. But markets can act in interesting ways – the price of Bitcoin could go down making it too expensive to mine. Or perhaps, Bitcoin will simply end, replaced by something else or taken down by an exogenous event. Anything is possible in the land of crypto.",2019-07-14,https://www.coindesk.com/arrington-backed-crypto-loans-firm-to-accept-telegrams-token-as-collateral,"Crypto loans firm Nexo says it will accept the gram ICO token from Telegram as collateral. Trouble is, the tokens may not be available for some time.

Nexo said that, once tokens have been received following the first public sale of gram tokens through the Liquid exchange platform, kicking off on July 10, it will allow customers to use the tokens as backing for its instant credit lines and planned credit card.

The limited gram sale – the first open to the general public – is being made via Gram Asia, a Korean firm claiming to be the largest holder of gram token – obtained through Telegram’s private, multi-stage ICO in 2018. The token sale reaped an astonishing $1.7 billion in two phases – the highest raised via an ICO at the time. Telegram is not associated with the gram offering, Liquid has told CoinDesk.

The ICO funding is being used to develop the Telegram Open Network (TON), an ambitious blockchain project aimed to decentralize multiple facets of digital communication, ranging from file sharing to browsing to transactions.

The Liquid exchange indicates that gram tokens will go on sale at a price of $4 each. Both U.S. dollars and the USDC stablecoin may be used for purchases.

However, it may be some time before grams are actually in users’ hands and can actually get to use them for backing Nexo’s loans.

That’s because the tokens will not be made available to investors immediately. New holders will have to wait until the TON launch, at which point tokens will be paid out in four tranches over 18 months.

Nexo told CoinDesk:

“If the mainnet launches, users would be able to claim their tokens at launch and immediately leverage them to borrow from Nexo, or to spend via our upcoming credit card.”

TON is slated to go live in Q3 2019, the representative said.

Should grams go see a wider public offering, the token has “the potential to become one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap,” according to Nexo. The full launch of the TON network is also likely to boost the market for grams, it said.

Nexo offers, its website says, insured accounts that provide automated and “instant” approvals for loans in over 45 fiat currencies. Crypto holders can also earn “up to 8 percent” interest on their assets.

The firm launched in April 2018, and is notably backed and advised by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, who confirmed to CoinDesk at the time that he holds a stake in the startup.

But on June 18, social networking giant

It's possible the reinvigorated market could cause some of the teens in this survey to rethink their position, and it may spur the 26% who said they were somewhat likely, very likely, or extremely likely to purchase cryptocurrency to pull the trigger.

As per the report, the CID argues that KBC is a Ponzi Scheme.

KBC reportedly launched 6 months ago, and its price has not moved since. KBC coins were reportedly issued at 10 paisas apiece, with the promise that they would skyrocket in value to 10 rupees in a short time ⁠— a 100-fold return on investment.

According to a CID member, an individual named Baljeetsingh Lashkariya promoted KBC via a pyramid scheme, saying that the “first investor in the chain would get an incentive from the last circle of investors. This offer played a major role in bringing more investors to the company.”

Lashkariya and another promoter, Mohan Patel, have reportedly “gone underground.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Indian legislators have recently proposed a bill that would punish crypto enthusiasts in the country with up to 10 years in jail for violating the country’s anti-crypto laws.

As far back as 2014, media pundits were referring to the bursting of the Bitcoin (BTC) bubble, with a Financial Times article from September of that year even containing the ill-fated prediction, ""We’re going to stick our neck out at this stage and call this the end of Bitcoin.""

Well, Bitcoin certainly didn't end in 2014, but this hasn't stopped other experts and commentators from throwing the word “bubble” around with gleeful abandon in the half-decade since the cryptocurrency's prematurely reported demise. However, while certain mainstream observers simply regard the entire cryptocurrency market as one giant balloon, other individuals have been offering more nuanced claims recently, assertions that revolve around a distinction between Bitcoin and the vast majority of altcoins.

More specifically, veteran trader and author Peter Brandt recently compared the altcoin market to the dot-com bubble, claiming that Bitcoin's recent strong rallies won't be replicated by other cryptocurrencies. Similarly, ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees argued last year that Bitcoin and altcoins form two separate markets, while on July 1, crypto-Twitter personality Lil Bubble published a parody music video that perfectly encapsulated the current plight of altcoins, which have been slightly flagging behind Bitcoin as it increases its market dominance to 62.2% (as of writing).

But even if it is true that Bitcoin's price has increased by around 128% over the last three months (compared to “only” 81% for Ether), there's no real indication or evidence that the majority of altcoins will tumble to virtually nothing while the original cryptocurrency remains strong. This is because, if you take the matter of market price out of the equation, it still remains just as arguable that certain altcoins have at least as much to offer in terms of functionality as does the bitcoin.

Bitcoin vs. altcoins

But try telling that to Peter Brandt. Not only did the author and founder of Factor LLC compare altcoins with the dot-com bubble in a tweet at the end of June, but in speaking with Cointelegraph, he doubled down on his comparison, predicting that the vast majority of altcoins will disappear in the not-too-distant future:

""I believe that the advance in late 2017 and early 2018 in altcoins will prove to be bubbles. I am of the firm belief that 95% of alt-coins will eventually be worthless and that BTC will occupy 80% to 90% of the total market cap of cryptocurrencies. No doubt several of the altcoins and macro-cap coins will find utility in specialized niches. It remains to be seen which coins these will be.""

These are strong views, but aside from the fact that Bitcoin has been rising in value more quickly than its rivals, it finds support in a number of quarters. For one, American broadcaster and Bitcoin cheerleader Max Keiser recently predicted during a CNBC interview that altcoins won't enjoy the same kind of rally that BTC is currently witnessing, and that most will fall away:

""Look, the dominance index is at 60% again, and it's going back to 80% or 90%. Because that's the only logical place for anyone who wants to be in crypto to be. But the short answer is, in my view, the altcoin phenomenon is finished.""

In fact, Keiser's views don't stop there. He told Cointelegraph that there's a big gulf between Bitcoin and other assets, particularly in terms of whether they've hit their “true” market value. Keiser wrote via email:

""Bitcoin is virtually the only financial asset ‘not’ in a bubble. Sovereign bonds are in multi-hundred year bubbles. The USD and various fiat money are in historic bubbles. Stock markets are in bubbles. Most property is also in a bubble. Gold and gold mining stocks are undervalued and good places to invest, but their upside is limited as compared to Bitcoin.""

In his interview with CNBC, Keiser offered some arguments to support his strong pro-Bitcoin view, such as that the top cryptocurrency has been improving its scalability with SegWit and the Lightning Network, and that it offers the most secure chain by quite a large margin. On top of this, he told Cointelegraph:

""Bitcoin’s hashrate, hitting new highs of 70 quintillion hashes per second (10x the estimated grains of sand on Earth), will continue to explode higher, taking BTC’s price exponentially higher and no alt-coin can compete. Like seedlings struggling under the canopy of a giant oak, they will wither and die.""

However, while other crypto traders would concur that Bitcoin is likely to increase its market dominance in the coming months, they wouldn't go so far as agreeing that altcoins are going to be wiped out. This is the position taken by Josh Rager, a trader who told Cointelegraph that, even with Bitcoin's current rise, there will remain other cryptocurrencies that perform well as a result of offering value propositions not covered by BTC:

""The Bitcoin dominance of the total market share is at 65% and as long as this continues to move up than the rest of the market will likely stay stagnant with price. As we see BTC dominance drop, we'll know that the rest of the cryptocurrency market will likely start to benefit with funds shifting towards altcoins with strong fundamentals. Not to mention a lot of other crypto assets with solid tech coming to the market starting in late 2019.""

United Kingdom-based trader and author Glen Goodman takes a similar view to Rager, explaining to Cointelegraph that at least some altcoins boast technological advantages over Bitcoin, something that makes their demise unlikely:

""Bitcoin is probably the most rational crypto asset to assign a high price to, because it currently has the highest likelihood of future mass-adoption. Some other cryptos are highly valued because their technological innovations show great promise, and that's perfectly valid, but technology is worthless if no one actually uses it, so all cryptos prices are based on the assumption that one day people will adopt the tech or use the product. Bitcoin is the only one most people have heard of, so it has a big head-start, but that doesn't mean the others are all doomed by any means.""

In other words, there appears to be a loose consensus among traders that Bitcoin is separating itself from the altcoin market, and that altcoins in general may be overpriced. Nonetheless, even with this separation, only the most hardened BTC champions believe that the altcoin market is on the verge of withering away. Indeed, as trader and CryptoOracle partner Lou Kerner told Cointelegraph:

""While most altcoins are probably significantly overvalued, some, like Chainlink, may emerge as very valuable entities. So it makes more sense to look at these on a case by case basis then make generalizations.""

Crypto as a whole

Speaking of generalizations, it's worth considering the question of whether the cryptocurrency market as a whole, including Bitcoin, is overpriced and currently passing through a bubble period. Well, as with the previous question, there is a consensus among traders that there is probably some overpricing going on, although this doesn't necessarily imply a Bitcoin or crypto bubble is taking place, as it looks as though the market is moving on the basis of a genuine belief in future adoption and growth. Glen Goodman, a former reporter for the BBC and ITV who quit his day job several years ago to become a full-time trader, told Cointelegraph:

""Crypto markets are largely driven by speculation but that doesn't mean they're currently in a 'bubble'. Classic speculative bubbles are characterised by euphoria and the mass-involvement of ordinary people who believe they will soon become rich. We saw that phenomenon in late 2017. […] I sold my crypto holdings shortly after, and waited for the bubble to fully deflate, which took about a year.""

Now, Goodman agrees that the market is still driven by speculation, but this is speculation in the sense that people still don't know for sure how the industry will develop, even if they're confident that crypto will sooner or later gain a wider foothold within the global economy:

""The market is still driven by speculation because it's difficult to assign fundamental value to cryptos. They don't have profits and revenues like stocks do, so it's very hard to decide how much they're truly worth. But crucially, that does NOT mean they're worth nothing. They are priced according to traders' personal assessments of their future prospects. Amazon didn't make profits for many years, but its share price kept rising anyway, because people expected great things in the future. Likewise, if many people rationally believe Bitcoin will achieve mass-adoption, then a high price is not unjustified.""

Josh Rager also holds that, overall, crypto isn't really in a bubble phase, although he does admit that certain aspects of the cryptocurrency market and industry have been bubble-like in recent months:

""The cryptocurrency market as a whole isn't a 'bubble' but I do believe we saw a bubble with ICOs and crypto assets not backed by solid fundamentals. In 2017 all you had to do is put together a small team, build a website and have a white paper to be considered a potentially valuable company. But as we saw, the majority of these companies 'run out of funds' by the end of 2018 and their assets were dumped on exchanges.""

Likewise, Rager asserts that the total crypto market cap has remained generally resilient over the past year, despite having fallen from its peak of around $485 billion. He also argues that, even though the market cap — without taking Bitcoin into account — is just $105 billion, it will start to slowly creep back up once the price of BTC begins a sideways movement and more money will flow into altcoins. More importantly, Rager believes that current market prices are sustainable, and that likely developments and innovations will gradually push it higher. According to Rager:

""The psychology of 5-digit Bitcoin over $10,000 has already set in as we saw sub-$10k prices were quickly bought up over this past week. Bitcoin and crypto miners seem to be holding on to more Bitcoin because they're profitable once again so there is a lack of selling pressure from miners overall. Not to mention all the new instruments for Bitcoin and the crypto market including BAKKT and institutions getting into the market more. And even LedgerX was recently approved to offer physically settled Bitcoin Futures to retail investors.""

As Rager concludes, ""All these signs show me that the market is maturing and we're not in any type of mania."" Other traders agree that things have changed decisively since 2017, as Scott Melker — a trader at Texas West Capital — noted to Cointelegraph that recent advances have come from more sustainable sources:

“I know it's cliché to say that ‘this time is different,’ but the evidence seems to support this belief. The recent increase has been fueled by institutional investors — retail has only started to pay attention in the past week, when the price advanced to nearly $14,000. During the last bull run, average people were already interested long before the price reached $10,000. The mania has not set in this time.”

Regardless, even if much of the current market activity has been sustained by unjustified hype and overexcitement, some traders would argue that this isn't much of a problem, since bubbles and manias are a part of capitalism and are necessary to build the foundation on which lasting industries are based. As GNY.io co-founder Richard Jarritt put it to Cointelegraph:

“Alan Greenspan famously warned against ‘irrational exuberance’ in relation to price-to-earnings ratios of stocks way back in December 1996. The talk of bubbles in stocks had arrived prior to the infamous tech bubble of the late 90's that saw the NASDAQ Composite scale to its height at 5,132.52.”

Jarritt adds that technology has proven particularly resistant to calls of being a bubble throughout modern history, and that Bitcoin and crypto more generally have only just begun as an industry. He said that “taking the diffusion of innovation theory and putting it into the context of how few daily transactions there are on the Bitcoin network currently (compared to how many daily transactions the Visa network handles), it gives space to imagine that cryptocurrency market valuations have not yet fully matured into what could be a peak many multiples above today's values or any past peaks in the industry.”

But assuming that the bubble-esque market of today does evolve into a fully fledged and sustainable industry in the coming years, it still remains to be seen which cryptocurrencies will still be around in a decade or so, and which will have gone the way of the dodo. Once again, opinions on this are mixed, with Bitcoin bulls unsurprisingly arguing that the first cryptocurrency will be one of the few present-day crypto’s still alive.

“In ten years we’ll see Bitcoin, and a bunch of coins that don’t exist now; the new crop of seedlings that start with promise, then fade away,” Max Keiser said, implying that even new coins arising in the future will struggle to dislodge Bitcoin from its position of dominance. Other traders, however, aren’t quite so bold, and while they accept that many cryptocurrencies will most likely perish, they admit that, perhaps, even Bitcoin might end up being supplanted by other coins at some point in the future.

“In ten years, most of the cryptocurrencies we know and love will probably be in the crypto graveyard,” Glen Goodman predicted. He went on:",,https://www.coindesk.com/rising-institutional-investment-setting-pace-for-future-crypto-growth,"Financial institutions have begun to enter crypto with a quickening pace, setting the tone for the remainder of 2019 and 2020.

What makes these years different from ones prior is the speed of professionalization taking place in the markets, according to our sources.

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB – a financial services group with digital asset specialism, drew comparisons on the various bull runs experienced over bitcoin’s (BTC) lifecycle, with the exception given to this year’s fundamental growth.

“The 2013 bubble was driven by technocrats and dark web trawlers and the 2017 rally was led by the whims of speculative retail traders, 2019’s growth belongs to financial institutions who are diversifying stale portfolios and finally have the professional machinery to do so.”

Last month in the UK alone, 9 financial institutions for banking and over-the-counter (OTC) trading were brought into the fold by BCB. That raised the count to 32, most of whom came onboard this year, says Landsberg-Sadie.

“This is a fundamental shift in client profile compared to last year which was dominated by crypto projects looking for liquidity.”

On the horizon

Indeed, crypto has been experiencing some of the largest levels of institutional growth as seen with bitcoin futures open interest and volume as well as a number of established banks issuing their own cryptocurrencies on their private blockchains.

In addition, these financial institutions are supporting a variety of blockchain projects focused on commodity trade finance and shipping, says Kari S. Larsen, a partner at Perkins Coie’s Blockchain Technology & Digital Currency group based in New York.

“Exchanges are changing their focus from retail traders to institutional traders, providing such customers better ability to customize the front end of their trading platforms and providing APIs that better suit what institutional traders are used to.”

Institutional investors rely heavily on regulated products and processes, organizations rely on steady progress on the regulatory front as well as infrastructure improvements, which directly affects the pace of institutional involvement.

However, the pace from financial regulators, at least in the US and parts of the EU, when it comes to providing guidance and licenses for entities seeking to focus on digital assets, has been very slow.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), for example, appears to be moving very slowly with broker-dealer applications from companies seeking to provide services supporting security tokens or related crypto products says Larsen.

Although, that is beginning to change mostly due to Facebook’s recent announcement on entering into crypto and the subsequent pushback from regulators on a global scale.

This has been reflected in BTC’s violent price swings in recent weeks, amplifying the discussion amongst regulators about what must be done about that ‘crypto issue’.

Setting the Stage

Facebook’s battle with regulators is sure to set the stage for crypto moving forward as the nuts and bolts of the regulatory framework are metered out.

With the potential advantage of on-ramping billions of users to digital assets through its Libra/BTC pairing, it can be argued that crypto poses a threat to traditional finance in a number of ways.

Therefore the time has come to tread carefully as over-regulation could put an immediate stop to bullish advances reflected in BTC’s latest price swings. Peaking at $13,880 on June 26 during a strong uptrend, BTC fell to a low of $9,950 before shooting back up to where it currently stands at $10,550.

Still, progress continues as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the United States’ regulatory agency with jurisdiction over futures markets, grants ErisX Clearing a derivative clearing organization (DCO) license under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

Rules and regulations take time to hash out but eventually the goal is to arrive at a happy medium that provides a stable platform to trade digital assets while encouraging fair trade and reducing risk.

There is a level of finesse when it comes to new markets as regulators scramble to make sense of crypto and how that fits into the current global financial model. The key here is to let the golden goose run free, careful not to implement too many restrictions while also reaping the benefits.

Month-to-month market capitalization

The monthly chart above reveals interesting insights into the total market cap experienced by the industry as of late, demonstrating its overall recovery which is nearing 50 percent retracement from the 2018 bear market and made headway amid another strong weekly showing in the form of large buy orders during June 1-June 30, suggesting these moves involve more than just the average trader.

A resurgence began on February 1 of this year when the total value closed above $130 billion for the first time in over two months, marking a strong shift in sentiment and trend with a hint of institutional interest.

Since then, the upward trajectory has been checked by steady increases in growing (bullish) volume seen by the large bars on the monthly chart, backing the trend.

Now above $300 billion, growth seems very plausible, given crypto’s recent bullish fundamentals, however, that will also depend largely on how the industry navigates the upcoming regulatory framework.

The unstable virtual currency, which plummeted more than 70 per cent in 2018, has enjoyed a phenomenal rally since the turn of the year.

Its value has gone from $3,714 - roughly £2,966 - at the start of January to a high of $12,444 - roughly £9,938 - in the end of last month, thought to have been fuelled in part by Facebook's announcement that it is to launch its own currency, Libra, in 2020.

Today, its value stands at $11,369 - roughly £9,079.

Bitcoin, which exists only in the digital world as computer code, was launched in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto and was the world's first decentralised cryptocurrency.

Its value has fluctuated wildly since its creation, and its value last month was the highest since March 2018, where it reached $11,557 - roughly £9,230 - before plummeting dramatically to $3,193 - £2,550 by December 2018.

However, despite the wild fluctuation and the chance for huge losses for investors, bitcoin's advocates believe it has the power to revolutionise money.

It is not controlled by national governments or central banks and so is seen as a way of keeping money out of the hands of financial authorities.

Facebook's announcement last month of the launch of its own cryptocurrency prompted a further rise in bitcoin's value.

Facebook has linked with 28 partners in a Geneva-based entity called the Libra Association, which will govern its new digital coin set to launch in the first half of 2020

Jehan Chu, co-founder digital currency investor Kenetic Capital, said: ‘The price surge is due to two major factors.

‘One is an increasing consensus among the investment community that bitcoin is a legitimate store of value for the digital age, and two, Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency launch has forced every chief executive to take crypto seriously.’

Wood is a tax lawyer representing clients worldwide from the offices at Wood LLP in San Francisco. He is the author of numerous tax books and writes frequently about taxes for Forbes, Tax Notes and other publications.

The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. This discussion should not be regarded as legal advice.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats Bitcoin and other cryptos as property. That means each property transfer can trigger taxes, with a tax hit to both the recipient and the transferor. A key question is the market value at the time of the transfer. Some crypto investors put crypto in legal entities such as corporations, LLCs or partnerships. Another avenue is a trust that holds crypto assets.

In North Carolina Dept. of Revenue v. Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family Trust, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously said that a state could not tax out-of-state residents on trust income without minimum contacts. We’ll come back to that case, but should note that trusts can be taxed in several different ways, depending on their type. There are living trusts that people usually use for estate planning, but living trusts are not separately taxed.

Crypto and living trusts

So, if you transfer Bitcoin to your living trust, it usually isn’t a taxable transfer, since your living trust isn’t really a separate taxpayer. It is still you, so you still report the gain or loss on a later sale on your personal tax return. There are also nongrantor trusts, in which the transferor is not taxed on them. These are separately taxed, and a separate trust tax return must be filed.

Trust tax rules can be complex, but that means the trust itself pays the taxes. There can be another tax on the distribution to beneficiaries. But leaving distribution issues aside, where does the trust pay taxes? That depends. Some trusts are foreign, meaning that they are set up outside the U.S. Those rules are complex, but if you are a U.S. person, you should not assume that you can avoid U.S. taxes with a foreign trust.

Still, it might be possible to have your trust pay the lower corporate tax rate of 21% rather than your individual tax rate.

What about state taxes?

This is where things get more interesting. Some trusts are set up with an eye on reducing or avoiding state taxes — say, if you are in California and don’t want to move to Nevada before you sell your Bitcoin. You want to cut the sting of California's high 13.3% state tax, but you aren’t willing to move — at least, not yet. You could consider setting up a new type of trust in Nevada or Delaware.

A “NING” is a Nevada Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trust. A “DING” is its Delaware sibling. There is even a “WING” in Wyoming. The usual grantor trust for estate planning doesn’t help, since the grantor must include the trust income on his/her own tax return. With a Nevada or Delaware Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trust, the donor makes an incomplete gift to the trust, and the trust has an independent trustee.

The idea is to keep the grantor involved but not as the owner. The state of New York changed its law to make the grantor taxable no matter what, but the jury is still out on these trusts in California and other states. Some marketers of NING and DING trusts offer them as alternatives or adjuncts to a physical move.

The idea is for the income and gain in the NING or DING trust not to be taxed until distributed, when the distributees will hopefully no longer be in the high tax state. The trustee must not be a resident of the high tax state. Parents frequently fund irrevocable trusts for children and may not want the trust to make distributions for years, removing future appreciation from the parents’ estates. Tax-deferred compounding can yield impressive results, even if only state tax is being sidestepped.

For tax purposes, most trusts are considered taxable where the trustee is situated. For NING and DING trusts, a common answer is an institutional trust company. Trust investment and distribution committees should also not be residents. The facts, documents and details matter, and states like California may well push back. However, doesn't the Supreme Court's recent North Carolina case help?

North Carolina case

The court ruled that North Carolina’s tax statute asserting jurisdiction on a foreign trust based solely on the residence of a beneficiary was too broad. But it is still constitutional for a state to tax based on the residence of the trustee or the site of the trust’s administration. Who forms the trust matters, too. In the North Carolina case, the trust was formed by the taxpayer’s father, and he was a resident of New York.

The taxpayer in the case was the daughter, and she was not the trustee and had no control over the trust. She didn't even receive any distributions from the trust in the years involved in the case. That made it a pretty compelling case for the Supreme Court to tell North Carolina it couldn't tax her.

California case

In contrast, many NING/DING trusts are formed by the person in the high tax state trying to avoid state tax — a person in California, for example. And then there's the distribution question, as some NING/DING trusts do anticipate that the settlor might receive distributions. The administration can be touchy too, as some NING/DING trusts include the settlor/beneficiary as a member of a distribution committee that exercises control over trust distributions.

Depending on the facts of the NING/DING trust, therefore, the Supreme Court's ruling seems pretty limited. In fact, the case is limited to the handful of states that use beneficiary residence as the sole factor for determining the state’s taxing jurisdiction. The court said its ruling should not impact states that consider beneficiary residence as only one of several factors for determining their jurisdiction to tax. Interestingly, California is one of five states identified in the case that establishes jurisdiction based entirely on the beneficiary's residence.

Even here, though, the opinion carves out California’s tax statute as an issue to resolve at a later date. California law only allows the state to assert jurisdiction based solely on the beneficiary residence when the beneficiary’s interest is not contingent (such as not subject to the discretion of a trustee). The North Carolina case involved a trustee who had discretion to control distributions, or to not make distributions at all.

So, will your NING/DING trust work to shield you and your beneficiaries from state tax? Creative trusts can be worth trying, depending on the right facts, but you need to be careful. You don't want to be low-hanging fruit for the high tax state to attack.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

The current hot debate is whether bitcoin will continue to rally while altcoins languish. Many have been outspoken in support of the largest cryptocurrency as it maintains its market dominance above 62%. Though bitcoin is the undisputed leader, it is unlikely that it will remain the only cryptocurrency that will see a sharp increase in price.

We believe that after the recent rally, bitcoin will take a breather while traders shift their attention to altcoins. However, unlike the previous bull market, this time, the market will differentiate between altcoins depending on their use cases. Therefore, a few altcoins might outperform while others continue to struggle to move up.

Traders should not buy tokens that have corrected sharply from their highs in hopes that their price will also recover. Their prices are near the lows for a reason. A better approach is to buy cryptocurrencies that have started to move up as it shows trader’s interest in them. Let’s look at the top five performers of the past seven days and analyze their charts.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) has risen by 8% in the past seven days and is the best performer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. If the market sentiment improves, can it continue its outperformance in the next few days? Let’s look at the charts.

The sharp fall in the XMR/USD pair from close to $120 in the week before found buyers at the critical support of $81. This is a positive sign because it shows that bulls are keen to buy on dips. This is the third time that $81 has held since mid-May, hence, this now becomes the new floor for the pair.

Both the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover on the weekly charts. This shows that the trend is changing and traders should utilize dips to buy.

The cryptocurrency is likely to trade between $81 and $150 for the next few weeks. As the range is large, traders can initiate long positions at the current levels and keep a close stop loss just below $78. The target objective is a rally to $150. Though there is a minor resistance at $120, we expect it to be crossed. This trade has an attractive risk to reward ratio. Our view will be invalidated if bears sink the price below $81. The next support on the downside is at $60.

BTC/USD

With the recovery in prices, bitcoin (BTC) bulls are getting confident again. Sky-high targets are back on the table. Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of crypto asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets, expects bitcoin to hit $100,000 by the end of 2021. Pompliano has walked the talk and has invested 50% of his wealth in bitcoin.

A report by Binance shows that the correlation between bitcoin and altcoins has decreased from 0.73 in Q1 2019 to 0.61 in Q2 2019. In the current leg of the up-move, bitcoin futures volumes have spurted. This shows that large traders are investing in the cryptocurrency. However, institutional traders are unlikely to continue their buying spree as prices skyrocket higher. Therefore, we do not expect the rally to sustain. What is a good level to buy? Let’s analyze the charts.

The uptrend from the lows ended with the BTC/USD pair forming a gravestone doji in the week before. Though buying was seen below $10,000, as suggested by us in the previous analysis, failure of bulls to sustain highs of the week shows that traders stuck at higher levels are bailing out of their positions closer to $12,000. If buyers fail to break out and sustain the price above $12,000 in the next week, it will attract further profit booking that can drag the price below $10,000 levels once again.

If bears plummet the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $9,965.48, the price can extend the correction to $8,727.40, which is the 50% retracement of the recent rally. A breakdown of this level can drag the price to the uptrend line. The upsloping 20-week EMA is also just below this line. Hence, we anticipate strong buying if the cryptocurrency corrects to this level. As the trend has changed from down to up, traders should use these dips to buy.

Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls propel the price above $12,000, the digital currency can retest $14,000. A breakout of $14,000 will resume the uptrend but we give it a low probability of occurring in the short term. We believe traders should wait and buy on dips instead of chasing the price higher.

BNB/USD

Binance is planning to launch futures trading in bitcoin with leverage of up to 20x. While leverage can be useful to an experienced trader, it can easily destroy a novice trader, so use it judiciously. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has switched tether deposit and withdrawal addresses from Omni-based addresses to ERC-20-based addresses, which will be the standard going forward. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices spurted higher on the announcement that Binance will list it. With fundamentals remaining strong, can Binance Coin (BNB) resume its uptrend?

While most cryptocurrencies are still struggling well below their lifetime highs made in the previous bull market, the BNB/USD pair continues to trade close to its lifetime highs. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the 50-week SMA is also turning up gradually. This is a positive sign and shows that the pair is in a strong uptrend.

Any dip to strong support levels offers a low-risk buying opportunity to traders. The first support on the downside is $28.7168. If this support breaks, the fall can extend to the uptrend line. The 20-week EMA is also close to this line, hence, we anticipate strong buying at this support. Traders can watch the price action at the above-mentioned levels and buy in a phased manner.

After the sharp up-move from the lows, the digital currency is likely to remain range-bound for a few weeks and consolidate the gains. The next leg of the up move will start on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $40.

ETC/USD

Recently, the Atlantis hard fork entered its testing stage. The update is scheduled for September. ETC Labs and Metronome also announced that chainhop functionality had been enabled between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic (ETC) blockchains. Though the cryptocurrency was backed by positive news on the fundamental front, how does its chart look?

The recovery in the ETC/USD pair hit a wall close to $10.040. This shows profit-booking at higher levels. However, a minor positive is that bulls have kept the price above the 20-week EMA during the pullback.

If the price rebounds off the 20-week EMA, bulls will again try to push the price above the $10.040–$11.880 resistance zone. This is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the price to $15 and above it to $20. Traders can buy part of their intended position size above $10.040 and add the rest on a breakout above $11.880.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-week EMA, the pair can slip to $5.22. Therefore, we suggest traders wait for the price to break out before initiating fresh positions.

XRP/USD

Xpring, Ripple’s ecosystem initiative, claims to have committed $500 million on XRP projects to over 20 companies since May of last year. The goal is to support projects that create use cases for Ripple’s XRP token. Let’s see what its chart projects.

The XRP/USD pair has been a laggard during the recent recovery in crypto prices. The bulls have repeatedly failed to sustain the price above $0.450, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. Currently, the pair is taking support closer to $0.370. Both the moving averages are also located at this level. Hence, this is an important support to watch out for.

If the price bounces off this support, bulls will again attempt to scale above the overhead resistance zone of $0.450 to $0.5050. We anticipate the digital currency to start a new uptrend and pick up momentum after it sustains above $0.5050.

However, if the price breaks below the moving averages, it can slide to $0.27795. A breakdown of the $0.27795–$0.24508 support zone will be hugely negative for the cryptocurrency. As the price is stuck inside the range, we believe that the best approach is to stay neutral on it until it starts a new uptrend. Notwithstanding, for traders who want to trade it, the best strategy would be to buy closer to the support and sell near the resistance.

3,000 Transactions Per Second in BCH Benchmark Stress Test

Software developer and miner Jonathan Toomim published a video on July 2 which shows how he built a benchmark to measure the performance of the Bitcoin Cash reference client Bitcoin ABC. Toomim’s test generated 672,000 transactions and mined them into blocks in roughly a nine-minute time frame. The results equate to more than 3,000 BCH transactions per second on his desktop computer. Toomim is well known for his Xthinner project and the developer said he plans to work on Xthinner so it can “propagate blocks before performing full transaction validation (and after only doing data integrity/merkle root+PoW checks).” “Testing block propagation was the original motivation for building this test apparatus,” Toomim explained. The software engineer continued:

I also intend to set up a networked version of this test with four 40-core computers, using the Linux netem module to inject artificial latency and packet loss. Again, this is primarily and initially to be used as a testbed for optimizing block propagation.

Bitcoin Cash Network Becomes the Second Most Valuable Chain

On July 2 the founder of Ryan Research, Peter Ryan, explained in a recent research analysis hosted on Coinspice.io that Bitcoin Cash recently became the second most valuable chain according to transaction volume or the total amount of value transacted through the blockchain. “While Bitcoin Cash might be fifth by market cap, its transaction volume is now 2nd,” explained Ryan’s analysis. “Around mid-May, that volume started to really take off and exceeded $2 billion per day — Other notable cryptocurrencies like ETH, LTC, and XRP are well below these new milestones.”

In fact over the last six months when comparing bitcoin core (BTC) and bitcoin cash (BCH) transaction volume there’s been a slight downturn, but in April both networks showed positive growth. After that, however, BCH began to outpace BTC in growth drastically, Ryan detailed. The researcher added:

In May, BCH saw 185% month-over-month growth in transaction volume while BTC only grew by 56%. BCH came close to a third of the volume of BTC in May only to settle in July at about a quarter.

As Bitcoin surged to prices not seen since 2017, a rising hash rate mirrored renewed interest in the cryptocurrency. By July 1, the Bitcoin mining hash rate surpassed 69 quintillion hashes per second.

Nevertheless, the action by Iranian officials is a stark reminder that regulatory moves can still hold sway over the use of cryptocurrencies around the world. The Bitcoin mining space has marched on over the last two years through the depths of a humbling and harsh environment for the entire cryptocurrency space.

According to data from Blockchain.com, the Bitcoin mining hash rate has been on a steady increase over the last six months:

These are encouraging signs for the mining ecosystem despite pressures on a number of fronts. Price volatility and regulatory efforts have been notable obstacles. With this latest instance of regulatory pressure on cryptocurrency mining in Iran, Cointelegraph takes a deeper look at the major countries that have extensive cryptocurrency mining activity and the stances they have taken over the past few years toward the emerging industry.

China

China has had an intriguing relationship with cryptocurrencies over recent years. Its government has taken a hard line toward cryptocurrency trading, with financial institutions by banning Bitcoin trading, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto exchanges.

Despite the status quo, China’s Bitcoin mining scene is a major player in the global hash rate, with China-based mining pools reportedly mining potentially 70% of all the coins created yearly. Furthermore, the global Bitcoin mining pools are dominated by Chinese ones. The reason for this dominance is largely due to the massive surplus of electricity in the country. This is most evident in the Sichuan province, which is considered to be the Bitcoin mining capital of China. It has been reported that this surplus of electricity has led to various power producers encouraging companies to set up mining operations in order to exploit untapped energy.

The dominance of China’s Bitcoin mining contingent could be disrupted if the regulations that were suggested back in April of 2019 come to fruition, with a government agency lobbying to ban crypto mining outright in the country.

It is a potentially damning blow for a country that is home to the likes of Bitmain, the producer of the world’s most popular ASIC miners. The company also has its own mining operations setup in the country.

Various reports in 2018 also suggested that many mining operators were looking for greener pastures overseas amid growing pressure from the Chinese government. It is understood that environmental concerns and a lack of tax revenue are driving factors of the apathy toward crypto mining in China.

Russia

Russia has a more lax approach to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in comparison with China — in that it still does not have a definitive regulatory stance on the space. Bitcoin is not regulated, but its use as a payment option for goods and services is illegal. This is set to change in the summer of 2019, as the Digital Financial Assets bill is expected to come into effect.

Up until this point, cryptocurrency mining has continued in the country, with the cold climate and cheap electricity as contributing factors. However, a report in June suggests that cryptocurrency mining operators could face fines in the future.

Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, told local media outlet TASS that the cryptocurrencies created on open blockchains were considered illegitimate. At the same time, Aksakov stressed that it is not illegal to hold Bitcoin in Russia if the cryptocurrency has been bought or acquired outside of the country.

Iran

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, Iran’s government has taken a stern stance toward the crypto mining industry in the country due to a massive increase in electricity usage over the past month. The Iranian energy ministry believes that mining operations are to blame for an irregular 7% spike in electricity consumption amid fears of its grid is taking undue strain and intends to cut power to crypto mining operators until it has approved new energy tariffs.

Iranians currently benefit from government subsidies, which reportedly bridge the gap of how consumers are billed and what their actual electricity costs are. It is a situation that has provided a favorable environment for crypto miners. The mining ecosystem received a regulatory stamp of approval in September 2018 after a number of Iranian government departments officially accepted crypto mining as a legitimate industry in the country. This is expected to be ironed out by formal regulatory and legal frameworks.

Given the increase in mining activity and the profitability in Iran, the country’s deputy energy minister, Homayoun Haeri, suggested that the billing of mining operations should be the same as charges for power exports in June 2019. Despite the positive sentiment that was portrayed at the tail end of 2018, the crypto mining scene in Iran will have to endure a few months of uncertainty until the new electricity tariffs are approved by the Iranian government. It is a blow for a country that is looking to cryptocurrencies as a possible means to bypass harsh economic sanctions that have hampered its ability to trade with the global community.

Canada

Canada has positioned itself as a crypto-friendly country that is openly providing opportunities for cryptocurrency mining operations to set up shop. The country has classified Bitcoin as a commodity, which makes users liable to pay tax, depending on how they acquire and use the cryptocurrency. If a Canadian receives Bitcoin as income, it is taxed as such, and if they hold it as an investment asset, they are liable to pay capital gains taxes.

As Cointelegraph contributor Selva Ozelli noted in an expert take last year, cryptocurrency mining is also taxed, depending on whether the operation is run as a business or a personal hobby. The latter is considered a nontaxable event. While the trade and use of cryptocurrencies are welcome but controlled in the country, the mining scene has been nurtured to a far greater extent.

A major catalyst for this has been the work of electricity provider Hydro-Québec and the Canadian government’s energy regulator, Régie de l’énergie. In May 2018, Quebec’s provincial government lifted a moratorium on the sale of power to cryptocurrency mining operators. At the time, over 100 potential mining operations had applied to purchase power from Hydro-Québec with reported energy consumption in excess of 10 terawatts per hour. Hydro-Québec runs 60 hydroelectric power stations, which, at that time, produced a surplus of around 13 TWh.

In June 2018, Hydro-Québec then introduced rules that required prospective cryptocurrency mining companies to bid for electricity. Their request would need to be substantiated by business cases, which specified jobs and investments that would be generated by their specific operations. Part of these rules would allow Hydro-Québec to enforce load-shedding on mining operations during periods of increased power demand from the province.

Within a couple of months, the energy supplier had to halt the processing of requests from miners due to the massive demand from the industry, which exceeded the provision of electricity at the time. Almost a year later, in April 2019, the Régie de l’énergie released new rules for the sector that have essentially ironed out the process for cryptocurrency miners to gain access to electricity.

Hydro-Québec was ordered to allocate 300 megawatts to the blockchain industry over and above the 158 MW that it had already been providing to its existing customers, along with 210 MW supplied by municipal distributors. In order to gain access to this allocated power, mining companies have to pass a selection process. The main criteria include jobs created, payroll of these jobs, the value of investments as well as heat recovery.

The Czech Republic and Iceland

The Czech Republic is worth noting, as it is home to Slushpool, one of the biggest mining pools in the world. The pool accounts for 7.5% of the total hash rate distribution. The European country is fairly relaxed in terms of its regulatory stance toward Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole. The Czech government does not consider Bitcoin as legal tender and classifies the cryptocurrency as an intangible asset.

Likewise, Iceland became a hub for cryptocurrency mining, given its cold climate and abundance of renewable energy sources. In February 2018, it was speculated that the electricity usage of the industry would surpass the total amount of energy used by households in the country. At that time, Genesis Mining was reported being the biggest energy consumer in Iceland.

The United States

America also has a strong mining culture that has been enabled by a fairly pragmatic regulatory approach in the country. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classified Bitcoin as a commodity in September 2015, and it is still treated as such. There are no specific restrictions on mining activity, while several states have taken different lines of approach to cryptocurrencies in general.

The city of Plattsburgh in New York could well be the only place in America that has formally banned cryptocurrency mining back in March 2018. This occurred after local residents began to complain of rising electricity bills as a result of cryptocurrency mining in the area. The city is located near a hydroelectric dam that provides cheap electricity. In March last year, the biggest mining operator in Plattsburgh reportedly used 10% of the city’s 104 MWh power supply. As a result, the Plattsburgh city council enforced an 18-month cryptocurrency mining ban.

A report from Crescent Electric Supply Company last year identified the cost to mine one Bitcoin in relation to the cost of electricity in each U.S. state. Louisiana was identified as the cheapest location to mine the first cryptocurrency. It was followed by Idaho, Washington, Tennessee and Arkansas. GigaWatt, the largest mining farm in the U.S., is situated in Washington.

A global phenomenon

The countries mentioned above have significant mining activities, but the truth is that cryptocurrency mining has become a global phenomenon. The major factor in the location of large mining farms is the availability of affordable electricity. Following that, the climate also plays a role. European countries and places like Canada have the added benefit of being in cold environments, which makes the cooling of equipment a straightforward endeavor.

The nature of Bitcoin mining, in particular, demands an increasing amount of power as the mining pool grows. The difficulty is constantly adjusted every 2016 blocks to ensure that one block is mined around every 10 minutes. This means that mining could potentially use more energy over time, as more miners vie to verify transactions and receive the BTC reward after mining a block.

Late in 2018, a study suggested that the total electricity usage of global cryptocurrency mining had surpassed that of mineral mining. This is a fact that has led to heavy criticism over the past two years. Some of these concerns have been abated by another report in June 2019 that suggests that as much as 74% of Bitcoin mining is powered by renewable energy sources. This will continue to be a hotly debated topic and will no doubt continue to be a consideration for mining operators around the world.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-futures-demand-bitcoin-derivatives-explodes/,"For a while now, investors have been waiting on futures for Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. These expectations have been stifled though, with regulatory uncertainty and interest concerns about the crypto asset.

But, according to a recent report from The Block, the CME Group, one of the world’s largest financial exchanges, is prepping to launch a product for Ethereum. For those unaware, the CME is a Chicago-based institution that famously launched Bitcoin futures near the peak of 2017’s boom.

The Block’s Frank “Fintech Frank” Chaparro suggests that the CME altering its reference rate and index for Ethereum could mean that futures are coming. An industry source told the outlet that this change is being done to “prep for an Ether” vehicle.

You see, according to the individual in question, cash-settled futures like the CME’s cryptocurrency contracts can be manipulated, requiring a robust index to mitigate such risk. This recent alteration may be taking place to convince regulators to approve of Ethereum-related products.

Ethereum Futures Gain Support

This tidbit of news comes as Ethereum futures have garnered support from key individuals in the cryptocurrency community.

One such individual is Thomas Chippas, the chief executive of upstart crypto exchange ErisX. In an extensive. 10-page letter given to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the American regulator that presides over digital asset futures, Chippas accentuated the need for an Ethereum vehicle.

He claimed that Ethereum, unlike some cryptocurrency projects, has a real and vibrant community, actual use cases, proper institutional involvement (JP Morgan, government organization, Ernst & Young, etc.), among other tenets of a healthy network. He went on to write that the CFTC supporting ETH would align with the agency’s commitment to “foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound derivative trading markets.”

There may be some bias in Chippas’ statement, as his company is looking to launch Ethereum futures in the near future.

Regardless, an unnamed CFTC official that spoke to CoinDesk earlier this year claimed that those at the governmental organization are amicable towards Ethereum. They quipped shortly after claiming that the CFTC is comfortable with the cryptocurrency:

“A derivatives exchange comes to us and says ‘we want to launch this particular product.’ … If they came to us with a particular derivative that met our requirements, I think that there’s a good chance that it would be [allowed to be] self-certified by us.”

Bitcoin Vehicles Also Well on Their Way

The seeming inevitability of regulated, U.S.-centric Ethereum futures comes hot on the heels of news that a number of cryptocurrency exchange startups have bagged licenses to list physically-delivered Bitcoin vehicles.

As reported by NewsBTC previously, ErisX revealed Monday that it has secured a DCO license from the CFTC. With this regulatory stamp of approval, the Bitcoin exchange now has the authority to list “digital asset futures contracts” on a platform slated to “launch later this year”.

The firm has notably been backed by Bitmain, CME, CBOE, ConsenSys, Digital Currency Group, DRW, Nasdaq, Fidelity, and, most notably, TD Ameritrade. The retail brokerage is expected to soon open Bitcoin and digital asset trading for its millions of customers across the U.S., many of which will soon get their first taste of cryptocurrency via an ErisX product.

This was revealed shortly after a similar announcement from competitor LedgerX. As reported by this outlet previously, the New York-headquartered platform received clearance from the CFTC last week. The approval also allows LedgerX to trade physically-settled BTC futures.

According to CoinDesk, chief operating officer Juthica Chou has claimed that her company has no exact timeline, but she noted that LedgerX is looking to be the incumbent in this market.

Featured Image from Shutterstock",2019-07-08 00:00:06+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/high-frequency-trading-is-new-battleground-in-crypto-exchange-race,"The Takeaway

High-frequency trading (HFT), a longtime and controversial practice in traditional markets, is becoming commonplace in crypto, too.

Placing trading servers physically close to exchanges’ matching engines can win an edge on speed. This helps HFT firms make large profits in the legacy markets.

Crypto exchanges such as ErisX, Huobi and Gemini are trying to attract large algorithmic traders with colocation offers.

Demand for the service is high, but its benefits are a matter of debate, due to the structure of the crypto market.

A handful of cryptocurrency exchanges are rolling out the red carpet for high-frequency traders.

Huobi, based in Singapore, and ErisX, in Chicago, have separately begun offering colocation, in which a client’s server is placed in the same facility or cloud as the exchange’s, officials at each exchange told CoinDesk. This allows those investors to execute trades up to a hundred times faster, giving them an edge over the rest of the market.

These exchanges join Gemini, which was one of the first crypto firms to offer colocation at a popular data center in the New York area, and is about to expand the option to include a second site in Chicago.

Notably, none of these exchanges charges for the service, seeing it as a way to differentiate themselves. “It’s our competitive advantage,” said Andrey Grachev, head of Huobi Russia, the exchange’s Moscow client office.

To be sure, such accommodations remain rare in crypto, which historically was dominated by individual traders and only recently began to draw interest from institutional investors such as hedge funds and family offices.

But the exchanges’ moves are a sign that high-frequency trading (HFT), a longtime and controversial practice in traditional financial markets, is slowly entering the crypto sphere. And though “bots” have been present in crypto since the days of Mt. Gox, colocation takes algorithmic trading to a different level.

Eric Wall, former crypto and blockchain lead at Cinnober, a financial technology company acquired by Nasdaq, told CoinDesk:

“It’s big business, everyone I’ve been speaking to that runs an exchange mentioned being approached by Wall Street types with these kinds of requests.”

Most crypto exchanges are not ready to satisfy this demand, Wall said. These are “very new concepts to many retail-focused exchanges with no experience of the traditional world, it seems.”

800K trades a day

In the six months since Huobi opened its Russia office, around 50 clients have taken advantage of its colocation service by locating their servers in the same cloud and using the same domain name service (DNS) as the exchange, according to Grachev.

The option allows these clients to make trades 70 to 100 times faster than other users, he said. “One of our clients makes about 800,000 trades a day, and there are more and more such clients.”

Unlike many crypto exchanges that use cloud-based servers, ErisX has a hardware matching engine, located in the Equinix data center in Secaucus, New Jersey, said Matthew Trudeau, the exchange’s chief strategy officer.

The same facility houses the matching engines of a range of major traditional exchanges, brokers and trading firms, Trudeau told CoinDesk, so traders that colocated servers in the data center can connect to ErisX’s matching engine there. (The firm launched spot trading in several cryptocurrencies in April and recently obtained regulatory approval for futures.)

Gemini, founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also houses its primary trading platform at Equinix and offers colocation there. The exchange plans to offer another colocation option soon in Equinix’s Chicago data center, where multiple stock exchanges — and their HFT customers — keep their hardware, according to Gemini’s website.

In a statement, Gemini’s managing director of operations Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto said the exchange “offers a variety of connectivity options to suit our customers’ needs. Each option is available to all of our customers free of charge.”

Coinbase, the leading U.S. crypto exchange, almost entered the fray, but this year closed down its Chicago division that had been working on services for high-frequency traders, including colocation. At the time, the exchange cited its prioritization of other institutional services.

The company declined to comment for this article. (Gemini, which just opened a Chicago office, hired some of Coinbase’s former employees there.)

Controversial practice

All of this invites the question of whether HFT, given its history on Wall Street, could exacerbate problems in the opaque and volatile crypto markets.

As depicted in Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys, algorithmic stock traders placed their servers in the physical vicinity of exchanges’ to execute trades faster than other investors and make profits on arbitrage between markets in fractions of a second.

The issue with HFT, as explained by Lewis, is that in a market where some players can perform trades hundreds of times faster than ordinary users, they get an unfair advantage and leave ordinary, non-algorithmic traders with inferior price options.

Another problem with HFT, according to a 2011 report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), is that it can dramatically increase volatility in markets.

In particular, it contributed to the so-called Flash Crash on May 6, 2010, when the prices of many U.S. securities fell and recovered dramatically in minutes, exposing ordinary traders to a higher risk which they couldn’t manage as quickly as HFTs.

High-speed trading has led to other technical glitches that cost companies hundreds of millions of dollars, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago wrote in 2012, noting that “some high-speed trading firms have equity ownership stakes in certain exchanges.”

Maturing market

However, ErisX’s Trudeau (who, it should be noted, was one of the early employees of stock exchange IEX, the heroes of Flash Boys) argued that high-frequency arbitrage and automated trading, in general, can benefit markets.

They are helping to narrow the price spread between different exchanges over time and make markets more efficient – including the crypto market, Trudeau said, explaining:

“This phenomenon has occurred in other asset classes as trading has become more electronic and more automated. Market makers and arbitrageurs are able to trade more efficiently, which improves price formation, price discovery and liquidity. Arbitrage opportunities may become fewer and more fleeting, which is a sign of a more efficient and maturing market.”

It’s important, however, to check if the exchanges and high-frequency traders strike deals with preferential terms which are not disclosed to the market, he noted.

As for ErisX, it “offers transparent, standardized pricing and connectivity options for our customers. All customs are offered the same terms of access and fees,” Trudeau said.

For its part, Huobi tries to make sure all users “compete on a level playing field,” said the exchange’s head of global sales and institutional business, Lester Li.

Li told CoinDesk:

“Our users know that we monitor for any abusive trading activity. We also continually remind users that there will always be risks when you trade, that is why we strongly recommend users to trade within their means and be mindful of the risks involved.”

Protecting retail

Still, other exchanges contacted by CoinDesk made a point of saying they don’t do anything special for algo traders.

A smaller exchange tailored for institutional clients, LGO Markets, which launched earlier this year, took the opposite approach, deliberately slowing the trading process for everyone, according to CEO Hugo Renaudin.

Before getting matched, the orders are gathered into batches and the hash of every batch gets recorded in the bitcoin blockchain — each batch takes around 500 milliseconds to form, so this serves as a “speed bump” for trades, Renaudin said. As a result, “every trader has the same feedback on the activity of the platform.”

Taking a similar stance, Kraken’s vice president of engineering, Steve Hunt, told CoinDesk the exchange doesn’t do anything differently for HFT customers.

“We want all customers regardless of size or scale to have equal access to our marketplace,” Hunt said.

Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is not considering offering colocation, account manager Anatoly Kondyakov told attendees of a recent “elite investor” meetup in Moscow. He gave two reasons.

First, “we’re trying to protect retail customers,” Kondyakov said, answering a question from the audience. Second, colocation means an official presence in a particular jurisdiction, he said, which Binance is not willing to do at the moment. (Binance is known for its deft regulatory arbitrage.)

Too soon?

Still, others said the crypto market hasn’t caught up with the traditional financial world to the point where offering colocation services to HFT firms would make much sense.

“Currently, the crypto market structure is still developing. HFT, in the context of equity and FX markets, does not really exist,” said Wilfred Daye, head of financial markets at San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin.

Traders coming into crypto from the traditional markets do ask for colocation, he said, but “the ask is one-off, not a popular ask in crypto,” so OKCoin doesn’t offer this service.

David Weisberger, сo-founder and CEO of market data platform Coinroutes, has another reason to be skeptical about HFT in crypto: this market is so much more dispersed and volatile that what works with stocks just won’t with bitcoin.

The concept of HFT front-running is irrelevant in crypto, Weisberger said, where the prices vary between different exchanges much more than in traditional markets:

“In futures or equities, with relatively large minimum quote variations, the bid offer spread is often stable with a lot of bids and offers at the same price. In that circumstance the fastest gets to be at the front of the queue whenever the price changes. Those orders at the front of the queue are profitable, while the ones at the back are not. In crypto, the tick size (price variation) is so small, it is easy to be ‘first’ by paying a slightly higher amount, so no need for incredible speed.”

Plus, crypto exchanges are so scattered around the world that there is no point in “being colocated to one exchange and still having to wait seconds for Binance to update,” Weisberger added.

The reason there is demand for colocation at crypto exchanges, he concluded, is simply human nature:

“People always fight the last war. People do what they are used to.”

Cryptocurrency skeptics who only focus on Bitcoin’s immediate price action are failing to see the forest for the trees.

In a recently published op-ed, Bloomberg contributor Leonid Bershidsky advised investors to ignore Bitcoin’s quick ascension to $5,000 as the move was nothing more than a “blip” driven by manipulation. Throughout the article, Bershidsky questioned the logic of investors optimistically viewing “Bitcoin as a better safe haven than other, more traditional investments” which provide more reliable returns and he advised investors to steer clear of cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, this guidance relies on more misconceptions than truth.

Bitcoin Forces Stocks to Play Second Fiddle

Admittedly, last year’s cryptocurrency price action was far from stellar, but viewing 2018 in isolation fails to incorporate Bitcoin’s performance since inception and this stunted view also ignores the technological strides blockchain and the Bitcoin network have accrued over time.

The premise that cryptocurrency investors are essentially putting their money into a slot machine is flawed and while most people will agree that Bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset, conventional portfolio building strategy calls for representation of high growth assets. Since the end of 2017s monster rally a number of financial analysts have suggested that a 1 to 2 percent digital asset allocation should be part of every well-diversified portfolio and considering Bitcoin’s current performance this appears to be sound advice.

As the chart below shows, the first half of 2019 provided great returns for stock investors and at the moment Bitcoin is strongly outperforming each of these markets.

Bitcoin vs. Major Markets

Bitcoin’s rise from $3,200 to $5,000 meant it was time for investors to begin paying closer attention to the cryptocurrency market and investors who followed Bershidsky’s advice in April have now missed out on a 180% gain.

Bitcoin-USD Daily Chart

The Market has Grown Beyond Speculation

According to Bershidsky:

There has been no good news about cryptocurrencies lately — they aren’t acquiring greater acceptance as investments or payments, and the crypto experiments of central banks, governments, and major companies haven’t moved beyond dabbling.

Again, there are numerous inaccuracies within this statement. In reality, the cryptocurrency market is booming and in more ways than one. Venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, financial institutions and numerous governments took note of Bitcoin’s 2017 performance and in 2019 the cryptocurrency market is backed by more than just speculative retail investors.

Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs, TD Ameritrade, and the Intercontinental Exchange are just a few of the larger players that have expressed deep interest in Bitcoin investment. Contrary to Bershidsky’s statement, the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem has evolved and also begun to penetrate other sectors.

In fact, less than two weeks ago MetLife announced that it would use Ethereum blockchain to streamline the processing of life insurance claims and StateFarm and USAA are reported to be following suit. Mastercard, Visa, Bank of America, and a growing list of companies are regularly filing blockchain-related patents and hiring blockchain developers at an increasing rate. The mass adoption of blockchain by these massive insurance and banking corporations is no laughing matter as life insurance is currently a $2.7 trillion dollar industry.

Further proof of the sector’s diversification and expansion comes from the rapid growth in the industry surrounding peer-to-peer and institutional-level crypto lending. This multi-billion dollar industry has blossomed to the extent that there are now a number of companies which allow cryptocurrency holders to securely stake and lend their digital assets for an attractive return.

Therefore the one-sided view that cryptocurrency investing is nothing more than gambling is quickly approaching obsolescence. Today investors have a range of crypto-investment options to choose from and it is much easier to align one’s selection with their appetite for risk.

Don’t Believe the FUD

There’s been bad news, though — more big hacks, more dying currencies, more pump-and-dump schemes (sometimes, the extinctions and the schemes go together). -Leonid Bershidsky

Obsession over the threat of manipulation, hacks, scams, drugs, dark markets, terrorism, and other illegal activities are another frequent set of critiques no-coiners and crypto skeptics often present when lambasting cryptocurrency. While manipulation, hacks, scams and, ransomware does pose a credible threat to portions of the sector, research has shown that less than one percent of Bitcoin is used for the aforementioned illicit activities.

The oft-referenced possibility of the Bitcoin network becoming centralized and susceptible to a 51% attack is also baseless. In reality, the Bitcoin network is stronger than ever and on June 21 the hash rate notched a new all-time high above 65,000,000 TH/s. This means it would take an immense amount of computing power to compromise the network and the fact that other fundamentals like block size and daily on-chain transaction volume are on the rise are all proof that a growing number of people are using Bitcoin.

Critics unwavering concern with hacks and scams are partially sourced from the trauma some investors publicly endured as the initial coin offering (ICO) era of 2016-2017 imploded and many projects and investment schemes were exposed as nothing more than get rich quick schemes.

Looking to the present, these issues have been addressed and thanks to the ingenuity of large cryptocurrency exchanges, entrepreneurs, and blockchain startups can now safely raise funds through initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Major exchanges like Kraken and Binance have also addressed the threat of hacks by integrating stringent security features to protect users funds.

Kraken upped the ante by providing increased transparency into its reserves through a Proof-of-Reserves audit which is carried out by an independent auditor. Meanwhile, Binance protects investors with its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). Recently the fund was put to the test when Binance underwent a $40 million hack in May and not a single investor lost money.

Simply put, major players in the sector have worked hard to address the weaknesses that undermined the sector’s credibility and the current state of the market does not align with the dystopian vision that crypto-skeptics frequently project onto the sector.

Ultimately, Things are Looking Up for Bitcoin

A simple investing idiom that many traders throw about is ‘don’t trade against the trend’, especially if it’s pronouncedly bullish. Bitcoin’s recent performance should perk up the ears of any sensible investor and while attempting to counter trade such a strongly established trend is questionable, completely ignoring it is nothing short of foolish. As Bitcoin repeatedly cascaded to new lows in 2018, smart money quietly began to accumulate Bitcoin and institutional demand for the digital asset has steadily risen since November 2018.

Proof of this comes as recently as June 17 when open interest for Bitcoin contracts at CME Group eclipsed the volume seen during the peak of the 2017 crypto bull market to reach 5,311 contracts totaling 26,555 Bitcoin (roughly $246 million). At the moment the general consensus is that institutions and Bitcoin’s upcoming halving event are fuelling the current rally.

From a bird’s eye view, the cryptocurrency sector is clearly vibrant and expanding. Crypto-payments and peer to peer transactions are gaining traction across the globe and Bitcoin is fast becoming the preferred store of value and exchangeable currency in economic and politically volatile countries like Iran, Venezuela, Argentina, and Turkey.

At the same time, investors in democratic countries with stable economies now have more credible, regulated options for investing in cryptocurrency and as discussed in this article, investment is merely one component of what has now become a multifaceted sector.

Cryptocurrency is bigger than investing and it’s bigger than just Bitcoin. The narrative that cryptocurrency has no future other than speculation is utterly false and the failure to adopt a long view of the sector’s growth potential means investors and businesses are leaving money on the table.

If you’re capable of shopping on the darknet, you’re capable of encrypting your order. PGP provides protection for both parties, thwarting man in the middle attacks and keeping busybodies at bay. The following guide explains how to install PGP and then use it to place an encrypted order on the darknet.

Pretty Good Privacy Is Very Good

Don’t let the name mislead you: Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is better than good – it’s excellent. The encryption standard developed by Phil Zimmerman in 1991 is today widely used for signing, encrypting and decrypting emails, text documents, and other files. If you’re familiar with using Bitcoin, you’ll understand the public/private key pairing that is integral to PGP. With Bitcoin, your public key is represented as your wallet address, while your private key is the part you guard with your life, since it’s used to access your wallet.

With PGP, your private key is used to verify your identity every time you sign a message, and thus should equally be safeguarded. For the purposes of this guide, we’re going to use GPG Suite which is designed for Mac. Windows users can install Gnu PG instead or similar open source software. If you’re wondering what the difference between PGP and GPG is, incidentally, the latter stands for Gnu Privacy Guard, and is simply a more up to date version of PGP. To all intents and purposes, however, they’re the same.

Setting up GPG Suite

GPG Suite comprises four pieces of software: GPG Mail, GPG Keychain, GPG Services, and MacGPG. Hit the download button and the 25 meg file will install on your desktop within a minute or so.

Run the standard setup guide, which will auto-install the software on your Mac, and then open GPG Keychain. Your first task is to create a new key, which will be used to sign and decrypt all communications you send and receive. Gpgtools has a good guide to creating your own key pair, which can be summarized as follows:

Select ‘New’ from the top left of the GPG Keychain console. Enter a name, email address and strong password. (Note: you don’t need to use your real name or real email address – nor should you if you’re intending to use this key on the darknet.) Decide whether to have your key uploaded to a public server, so others can easily import it and message you. If you’re creating this key solely for use on the darknet, you’re better selecting ‘No.’ Note that once a key has been uploaded to the key server, it cannot be removed. Select ‘Generate key’ and after a few seconds your new key will appear in GPG Keychain, with the words ‘sec/pub’ (secret/public) and a green bar to show it’s valid.

Now that we’ve covered the setup process, let’s take a trip to the darknet and run through the ordering process on one of its many marketplaces.

How to use PGP to Order From a Darknet Market

For the purposes of this walk-through, the darknet market chosen is Tochka Market, its onion address selected from dark.fail. Upon logging in to Tochka and selecting the item I wish to order, I’m prompted to enter my details.

If I was being lazy and wasn’t bothering to encrypt, I’d just paste my delivery address in here, but for the reasons outlined at the outset, this is ill-advised. Instead, make sure that you have GPG Keychain open on your desktop. Then, select the vendor’s PGP key that is displayed above the message window. (Other DNMs may require you to visit the vendor’s profile page to obtain their PGP key.)

Select everything from —–BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—– to —–END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK—– including these two headers. Then select CMD+C to copy the address. When you do this, the GPG Keychain icon in your dock will bounce, and when you click on the icon you’ll be asked whether you wish to import the key. Select ‘Yes’. If you order from the same vendor again, you’ll be able to skip this part since you’ll already have their key stored for future reference.

Next, open Textedit and paste your postal address into a blank document, select the text so that it’s highlighted, double tap on the trackpad, and from the menu that appears select Services > OpenPGP Encrypt Selection. In GPG Keychain, check the box pertaining to the vendor whose key you just imported. (If you’ve shopped with a few vendors, you’ll have multiple keys stored in here, so it’s important to make sure you’ve selected the correct one.) Select ‘Encrypt’ and a jumbled message that looks like this will appear in a new Textedit window:

Copy and paste the message into the order form on the darknet market, submit and that’s it: your encrypted message will be sent to the vendor.

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is an indicator, created by Marc Chaikin, that’s used to analyze Money Flow Volume over a specific “lookback” period of time, usually 20 or 21 days.

The concept of Money Flow Volume (MVF) is a variable used in the calculations by Chaikin and measures the buying and selling pressure of an asset over a single period. In order to calculate money flow, one must first determine the Money Flow Multiplier used in the overall equation.

To calculate the Money Flow Multiplier for a period:



[(Close – Low) – (High – Close)] /(High – Low) = Money Flow Multiplier Money Flow is defined by multiplying the Multiplier with the volume for the current period: Money Flow Multiplier x Volume for the Period = Money Flow Volume

Thankfully, you don’t need to do the equation every single time, as charting websites like TradingView can do it for you.

The Chaikin Money Flow

The CMF’s value fluctuates between 1 and -1, with the basic interpretation that when the CMF is closer to 1, buying pressure is higher, while, conversely, when below 0 and closer toward -1, selling pressure is higher.

What to watch for

The chart above shows that from period Jan. 6 to Jan 9. 2019, prices began to retrace after a slight rally occurred the day prior.

But with a triggered sell-off along the $4,000 former support zone, the CMF illustrated a huge pickup in selling pressure and confirming the bearish move as legitimate and extensive.

Indeed, savvy investors could have used the CMF to gauge the swift rejection at the neutral zero-line, conserving 9-10 percent of their investment in the process.

Bear/Bull Cross

A bull or bear cross with the CMF simply means a crossover above or below the neutral zero-line when the indicator begins to move and switch from one zone to the other.

Recent price action shows a dip below 0 as it crossed into negative territory amid a minor sell-off, indicating that selling pressure is greater for that current period and the possibility for dipping lower is increased.

However, the CMF isn’t always perfect and only posts information after a major move has occurred, allowing one to simply confirm its placement in terms of momentum and volatility.

The CMF is best used in conjunction with other indicators like the relative strength index (RSI), stochastic or Chaikin oscillator in order to provide confirmation to your primary reading.

And while it is useful on all time frames, the CMF functions optimally in analyzing longer-term trends.

Weekly chart

Here we see the RSI providing a fairly lackluster reading on Dec. 31 of 31.54 combined with the bearish cross on the CMF as price made no new highs after temporarily attempting to rally higher.

Once the CMF reaches the bottom of the range, selling pressure is at its greatest extent and if no further drawdown is achieved then you may consider prices to be stabilizing at those current levels.

But there are limitations…

The Chaikin Money Flow faces limitation in the aforementioned Money Flow Multiplier as it does not take into account the change in a trading range between periods, meaning any price gaps on the chart won’t be picked up and will fall out of sync until an eventual reset or a reconfiguration of the values.

When combined with other indicators, however, the Chaikin Money Flow can be a useful tool for measuring the buying and selling pressure of a particular asset over a specified timeframe and could save you potential losses in the future when used in conjunction with other noteworthy signals.

The announcement from Facebook that it is launching its own cryptocurrency, Libra, has the potential to change all of this. With close to 2.4 billion people using its social network each month, combined with the company’s many other social platforms, like WhatsApp and Messenger, Facebook brings with it the necessary critical mass to help take Libra mainstream.

Overcoming regulatory hurdles

However, a growing challenge for any new cryptomerchant is regulation. National regulators around the world are now much more knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies than they were even two years ago and are developing global policies, alongside card scheme limitations, to bring them under the oversight of the relevant authorities.

There have been some countries that have taken the leap into facilitating the use of crypto early on, such as Estonia and Malta. But, with Facebook’s customers potentially driving Libra into every corner of the globe, those regulators that haven’t yet made moves will need to be on their toes and prepare the way now for the arrival of digital currency.

Most governments and regulators have resisted acting to bring crypto into the fold for several reasons. Many lack an in-depth understanding of how they work. Others have been concerned about crypto’s potential to devalue local currencies, as well as the lack of transparency around flow of funds.

With one of the largest companies in the world is pushing a crypto product into their country regulators no longer have choice but to act. They will also have to work out ways to keep up. Facebook tends to self-regulate and, from the initial public communications, Libra will be no different. With regulators in most countries not yet having a specific crypto policy, it looks like the rest of the industry will now look to play by Facebook’s rules.

“With such a huge company as Facebook now leading the charge, others such as Apple, which is becoming increasingly payment focused with Apple Pay, may look to replicate. Perhaps the likes of Google and Amazon will soon join in?

Investment and innovation

There are big positives for the crypto industry in general as a result of this development.

Firstly, the fact that such a huge tech company, like Facebook, is entering the market legitimises the concept in the eyes of the masses, so will switch current doubters into believers that this truly is the future of currency. Once this obstacle is overturned, there will be many more potential consumers pulled in with the Facebook tide.

Secondly, with such a huge company now leading the charge, others such as Apple, which is becoming increasingly payment focused with Apple Pay, may look to replicate. Perhaps the likes of Google and Amazon will soon join in?

It may well be the case that these newcomers will look to buy a ready made cryptocurrency, instead of developing their own product. This therefore creates innovation in the market, with investment to support the innovation. Combined with the changing legislative landscape, this will serve to create a radically different and exciting sector.

All of this will, no doubt, be seen by some parties as a weakening of the core ideal of cryptocurrency. After 2008’s economic challenges, Bitcoin developed as a way of taking control from the financial institutions that caused the problems and brought control back to the people. What is happening now is that the financial control is being transferred from financial corporations to tech corporations who, in the eyes of many, already have too much power and knowledge of their users. Observing how this plays out in a world that is increasingly trading personal data for convenience will be very interesting.

I have said for years that Bitcoin, Ethereum and the like are essentially the Myspaces of crypto and that everyone is waiting for the Facebook of crypto to arrive. With the launch of a new digital currency by Facebook itself, it looks like that analogy may be more accurate than even I predicted.

But we cannot know for sure – only time will tell if Libra truly turns out to be the crypto that makes it to the payment mainstream.

Nasser Hakimi, deputy governor for new technologies at the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), said that bitcoin trading is not legal in the country, citing a related prohibition by a local anti-money laundering (AML) authority, the Supreme Council of Combating and Preventing Money laundering and Financing of Terrorism Crimes.

In an interview with Tasnim News, Hakimi warned the public against legal and investment risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, outlining a high level of bitcoin’s volatility. Alongside, the official also expressed concerns about crypto advertisements, bringing awareness of promoted bitcoin pyramid schemes in the public.

The official has also reportedly raised the issue of the need to draw a distinction between the production of cryptocurrencies and its trading.

In late June, Iranian authorities announced that they start cutting power to cryptocurrency mining until new energy prices are adopted, with a local energy official reporting an abnormal spike of electricity consumption allegedly caused by increased mining of crypto. As such, local prosecutors seized around 1,000 bitcoin miners from two now-defunct farms in late June, BBC reported.

On July 6, Iranian Assistant Minister of Industry, Trade, and Supply stated that the United States Congress is allegedly working to stop Iran’s access to crypto and bitcoin mining in an attempt to prevent the country from using a tool for evading sanctions.

When Satoshi Nakamoto built Bitcoin, design choices were made that effectively limits the number of Bitcoins that will ever exist to (roughly) 21 million.

A fixed supply limit certainly gives Bitcoin BTC anti-inflationary properties, but the reason it was set to 21 million is hidden in personal correspondence between Nakamoto and software developer Mike Hearn.

21 million was an educated guess

According to an email shared by Hearn, Nakamoto intended Bitcoin‘s unit prices to eventually align with traditional fiat currencies, so that 0.001 BTC would be worth 1 Euro, for instance.

“I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,” Nakamoto said.

“If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit,” they added.

Turns out, Nakamoto was a little off in their prediction. 0.001 BTC is currently worth 10.62 Euro, almost 11 times their original example.

OK – but how did Nakamoto come to 21 million Bitcoin?

Nakamoto explained why they chose 21 million for Bitcoin‘s supply limit, but never really expressed how.

One solid theory involves dissecting Bitcoin‘s distribution model (which had been hinted at in the Hearn email), but it unfortunately requires some mathematics.

Many believe that Bitcoin‘s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set when Nakamoto made two key decisions, that: Bitcoin should add new blocks its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average); and the reward paid to miners (starting with 50 BTC) halves every four years.

A post on the Bitcoin section of popular dev forum StackExchange suggested Bitcoin‘s 21 million supply limit is more of a mathematical coincidence than a conscious choice.

Calculate the number of blocks per four year cycle: 6 blocks per hour

* 24 hours per day

* 365 days per year

* 4 years per cycle

= 210,240

~= 210,000 Sum all the block reward sizes: 50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + … = 100 Multiply the two: 210,000 * 100 = 21 million.

But as one responder put it: this arithmetic only really provides the maximum amount of Bitcoin that can ever exist, and that number was determined by the parameters set by Nakamoto in the first place — so again, this doesn’t answer why.

Yeah but that’s just numbers

If you’re like me (and you’re over the mathematics already), the internet is ripe with alternative suggestions much easier to understand.

Satoshi Nakamoto decides 21 million is a good number, 2008

An interesting theory, sure …

This is worth looking into

So, there you have it. Nakamoto is a secret numerologist, die-hard table tennis fan, and a serial guesstimator.

Shapeshift, the company that allows traders worldwide to exchange hundreds of cryptocurrency pairs launched its new crypto platform that now offers an integrated suite of digital asset management in a noncustodial fashion. The firm believes the latest release offers a true end-to-end solution that aims to bolster free market finance.

Shapeshift Launches New Trading Engine and Self-Custody Solution

Launched in 2014, the Shapeshift platform has provided cryptocurrency users with the ability to quickly swap a variety of digital assets in a secure environment. Not long after the company started, Shapeshift began to offer hundreds of trading pairs. This week the firm has launched its new platform which can be found at the domain Shapeshift.com. After leaving private beta testing period on Monday, the web-based crypto platform has a whole new look with a dashboard that shows current assets and a tab that accesses the vast amount of trading pairs. Moreover, the biggest advancement for the new Shapeshift is the end-to-end solution for storing, sending, receiving, trading and tracking the company’s wide variety of digital coins.

Shapeshift allows people to trade some of the most popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) which recently became the second most valuable blockchain by transaction volume, according to a recent research analysis conducted by Ryan Research. You can also swap other well known digital assets like litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH), alongside a wide selection of lesser-known coins and ERC20 tokens. The newly integrated digital management suite for Shapeshift provides you with the ability to merge with the trading platform using either a Keepkey or Trezor hardware wallet device. According to the team, there will be more methods of key storage coming in the future. The new Shapeshift platform seeks to be an easy to use solution that competes against third-party solutions. Moreover, the new app is tethered to real-time market-data via the Coincap API for accurate, up-to-date pricing and historical data.

During the launch announcement, the company explained that rather than targeting institutional custody solutions Shapeshift aimed for an international retail audience. Giving traditional everyday crypto users an integrated digital management suite and the ability to swap coins in a noncustodial fashion has been Shapeshift’s main driver. Since the inception of cryptocurrencies, centralized trading platforms have been plagued with hacks and exit scams. Shapeshift’s latest product is focused on curbing this problem by giving traders the ability to trade coins in a far safer manner while also storing them in one place.

“For too long the cryptocurrency space has been fractured, with price tracking, trading and holding taking place on dozens of separate apps and sites — With the new Shapeshift, it’s all finally under one roof,” said Michael Perklin, Shapeshift’s chief information security officer.

An Entire System Built Without Custodial Risk

Shapeshift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees said the new platform has been in the works for quite some time. “For over a year we’ve been preparing the next evolution of Shapeshift, a holistic crypto-platform for hodling, buying, selling, trading, tracking, and managing digital assets across multiple blockchains, all without custody.” Voorhees continued by adding:

The new Shapeshift is arguably the world’s first non-centralized multi-chain digital asset platform — It becomes the basis of self-sovereign finance and we’re immensely proud to bring this to market.

Existing users can check out the new Shapeshift today and anyone can register to start trading over 50 digital assets held on the exchange. Individuals should note that a know-your-customer (KYC) verification is required to use the platform’s trading engine.

Voorhees explained that the new Shapeshift is built “on years of technology and learning, to deliver an end-to-end non-custodial digital asset experience.” Before the platform opened to the general public Vorhees revealed that roughly 20,000 users tested the platform during the beta trial period.

As a second layer over the blockchain of the biggest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), the LN is designed to enable fast and zero-fee transactions by creating payment channels between users. Specifically, the network aims to address bitcoin’s scalability problem by keeping the majority of transactions off-chain.

By launching its own LN node, Bitstamp aims to promote the growth of the network, as well as encourage the crypto industry to adopt the technology, the firm wrote in an official announcement.

Bitstamp said that bringing more nodes to the LN will keep the network active, describing the nodes as its basic building units. As more nodes generate payment channels, the total network liquidity increases, which in turn increases the transactions capabilities on the network, Bitstamp explained.

Most recently, LN services became available on major American crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase through payment crypto recharge provider Bitrefill. In late May, Bitfinex crypto exchange revealed its plans to launch LN support for the USDT stablecoin operated by its sister company Tether.

At press time, Bitstamp is the 39th largest cryptocurrency exchange according to its adjusted daily trading volume of around $175 million, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

In May, Cointelegraph reported that Bitstamp launched an investigation after a large bitcoin sell order strongly affected its order book.",,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullshit-nouriel-roubini-tells-bitmex-boss/,"News Taipei Debate Update: Bitcoin Is Bullshit, Nouriel Roubini To BitMEX Boss

Anyone who says Bitcoin is a decentralized payment technology is bullshitting, according to noted economist Nouriel Roubini.

The chairman of Roubini Macro Associates called the cryptocurrency a “total flop” because it allocates power to only a handful of people. He claimed that almost every business activity that took place inside the Bitcoin industry has turned centralized. Mining, for instance, is now in the hands of a few big players, as not envisioned in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Exchanges, too, practice significant control over the cryptocurrency’s liquidity and price.

Roubini also noted that a higher percentage of Bitcoin wealth belongs to a lesser number of people, which means they could move the cryptocurrency trend in any direction based on their preferences. Excerpts:

“Vitalik Buterin [the Ethereum co-founder] spoke about the inconsistent trinity. You can only encrypt something decentralized, scalable, and secure. Crypto does not satisfy even one of them let alone two of them.”

Bitcoin Takes Finance Back to Stone Age

The statements appeared during a debate with BitMEX CEO & co-founder Arthur Hayes held last week at the Asia Blockchain Summit 2019 in Taiwan’s Taipei. Mayes projected Bitcoin as a technology that gives people financial security and freedom without needing a bank while Roubini dissented entirely.

The economist went on bashing Bitcoin for its lack of security, citing how centralized exchanges controlled 99 percent of the cryptocurrency trading. They didn’t have what it takes to secure their clients’ funds, which is reflective in the higher number of hacking incidents that took place in the past decade. Roubini further thrashed the idea of having public keys as a mean to protect oneself against an exchange’s immaturity, stating that anybody with a gun can force a person into sharing those private keys.

“If somebody holds me to a gunpoint and take me to an ATM, then there is 300 bucks out of me not $300 million. Bitcoin is completely insecure,” said Roubini. “Instead of being a sophisticated financial system, it goes back to the stone age.”

Hayes, on the other hand, believed that letting people have complete ownership of their money is what Bitcoin excelled at entirely.

“Bitcoin is for personal sovereignty. If you hold your keys, you are much less likely to lose them,” he reasoned.

Attacking Bitcoin Network is Bad for Everybody

On Nouriel Roubini’s remarks on centralization in Bitcoin mining, Hayes explained to the scholar that a mining pool does not necessarily mean a single operator’s control over the Bitcoin network. A pool comprises of many small miners allocating a certain percentage of computation power to confirm and add blocks on the blockchain.

“Bitcoin,” added Hayes, “has not faced a single 51 percent attack happening on the network and destroying the value. Because at the end of the day, if a miner or group of miners colluded to, say, reverse transactions, they would essentially bring the infrastructure’s worth down to zero. It is not in their interest to violate these rules and that is the whole point and that is why Bitcoin is more secure than any centralized system.”

Earlier today, a combined 707.1 BTC was sent from one of the hacker‘s Bitcoin wallets to a separate pair of addresses.

The two transfers, for 706.1 BTC ($8 million) and 1 BTC ($11,384) respectively, were detected by Twitter-based transaction monitor @whale_alert.

In May, Binance (one of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges) suffered a sophisticated cyberattack that saw hackers make away with 7,000 BTC (then, $40M; now, $83.5M) in a single transaction.

In response, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao publicly floated the idea of rolling back the Bitcoin blockchain to reverse the attack.

The plan, however ill-advised, would’ve consisted of recruiting a majority of the Bitcoin network to work in unison against the hackers, a plot similar (in effect) to a “51-percent attack.”

Zhao abandoned the idea shortly after announcing it.

In June, the hackers mysteriously moved portions of the stolen 7,000 BTC in a strange series of transactions, albeit after splitting their loot across seven separate Bitcoin addresses, as detected by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

But with 10 percent of the stolen funds now shifted, all eyes are on the Bitcoin addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges across the internet — as the hackers are likely hunting an avenue to launder (and cash out) their digital loot.

We apologize for the mistake.",2019-07-08,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-ponzi-scheme-says-it-has-no-cash-to-pay-out-to-upset-investors,"Bitcoin Wallet, a lucrative South African “investment scheme,” used to attract hundreds of investors a day, many of whom clamored at the company’s doors to invest. Now, the company’s shuttered office is attracting hundreds of protestors demanding their cash back, according to Ladysmith Gazette.

As of July 4, the enterprise that many regulators and media had begun suspecting of operating as a Ponzi scheme shut down. The firm enticed investors with promises of 100-percent returns in just over two weeks by reinvesting customer deposits in cryptocurrencies. These same investors want to know where their money went now that the company closed.

Bitcoin Wallet founder Sphelele “Sgumza” Mbatha admitted to the Ladysmith Gazette on Saturday that he doesn’t have any more cash to pay out to clients.

“I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know online or how this system works. [It has] to be workshopped,” he said.

Before closing, Bitcoin Wallets had grown so popular that Mbatha stopped taking in deposits of less than 5,000 rand or $350. At the time, African News Agency speculated the firm received more than R2 million in cash deposits per day, representing “the largest daily cash flow in the whole of Ladysmith.”

A former paramedic, Mbatha claimed in a June radio interview that his operation was aboveboard though efforts by the ANA to confirm the legitimacy of the business registration proved futile.

The news agency spoke with market regulator Financial Services Conduct Authority (FSCA) which reportedly stated that the registrar’s signature in Bitcoin Wallet’s business certificate looked like it had been forged and needed to be investigated.

Despite these reported concerns of potential fraud, hundreds of South Africans had invested in the cryptocurrency upstart. Mbatha certainly made it easy.

According to ANA, investors would queue up overnight outside the Bitcoin Wallet office, provide basic identification information, sign a single page form, deposit however much they could, and then wait 15 working days to receive 100-percent returns.

The company charged a 10-percent administrative fee.

When asked about his business operations Mbatha stated funds entrusted to Bitcoin Wallets were reinvested in cryptocurrencies and then resold to the market at a higher price. Later, Mbatha declined a follow up interview stating, “time is money.”

Now, Mbatha claims he was only the “manager of the Ladysmith branch,” and that “I won’t continue working. I don’t have cash anymore. The owner says people must go online and collect their money online. I, myself, have invested my money in there. I submitted my banking details online and now I am also waiting.”

ANA previously reported Mbatha had become a local celebrity, drove luxury cars, and even had a police escort.

In a letter dated Monday to the Senate Banking Committee responding to pointed questions the lawmakers sent in May, Marcus took a diplomatic tone, acknowledging the panel’s concerns about data privacy and telling them:

“I want to give you my personal assurance that we are committed to taking the time to do this right.”

A similar letter was sent to the House Financial Services Committee, the Hill reported earlier Tuesday.

In the letter, which was printed on Facebook letterhead, Marcus said personal data would not be attached to any transactions conducted on the Libra blockchain.

“Similar to existing and widespread cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and bitcoin, transactions that take place directly on the Libra Blockchain are ‘pseudonymous,’ meaning that the user’s identity is not publicly visible,” he wrote, reiterating a promise Facebook has been making since it unveiled the Libra project last month.

The blockchain addresses in a transaction, a timestamp and the transaction amount will be public, but any know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money-laundering (AML) information would have to be stored by the wallet providers.

As a caveat, Marcus noted that Libra will be an open-source platform, any third party developer will be able to build their own digital wallet.

These third parties would be responsible for how their Libra wallets are built, Marcus explained, saying “it will be the responsibility of these providers to determine the type of information they may require from their customers and to comply with regulations and standards in the countries in which they operate.”

He added:

“Regulators of Calibra and other digital wallet services can require them to collect information about the identity and activities of their users and make such information available to law enforcement and regulatory agencies, such as for AML, CFT [counter-financing of terrorism], and sanctions purposes.”

In response to questions about what sort of consumer financial information Facebook already has, Marcus wrote that a subsidiary of the social media giant (unrelated to Libra) stores “non-public personal financial information data,” such as payment credentials, in compliance with existing law for transactions, but that this information is not used for advertising or for personalization.

Moreover, because the Facebook Payments, Inc. subsidiary processes these transactions, Facebook itself does not have access to any payment credentials information, though it does collect other information affiliated with a transaction, such as the merchant, the transaction amount, the date and time and the purchased good.

Church and state

The Libra Association, Facebook’s governing council for its blockchain network, will have even less information than Facebook Payments does, Marcus told the senators.

Because validator nodes or wallets will process and store transactions, neither Facebook nor Libra will store personal data, he claimed.

Facebook set up a subsidiary to develop an open-source wallet for Libra, called Calibra. Marcus explained that “Calibra will be Facebook’s representative in the Association. As a separate, regulated subsidiary of Facebook, Calibra will safeguard consumer financial data and will not use or share this data for ad targeting purposes.”

As a custodial wallet, Calibra will maintain some consumer financial data, however.

“Aside from limited cases, Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook or any third party without customer consent,” Marcus wrote.

Exceptions include data shared with law enforcement agencies or regulators in accordance with law for AML or CFT purposes, as well as in accordance with sanctions law.

“For example, Calibra customer account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on Facebook or across its family of social media and messaging products,” Marcus added.

In response to questions about individual credit ratings, Marcus wrote that “Facebook does not obtain or use consumer reports or credit scores for any purpose.”

Revealed last month, Facebook’s exhaustive plan to create a widespread payments system targeting unbanked individuals was immediately met with regulatory and legislative pushback. Lawmakers and other government officials worldwide have been questioning the project, if not outright calling for a moratorium on development.

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on the project on July 16, with the House Financial Services Committee holding another the next day. Marcus will testify at both.

Marcus said in his letter Tuesday that the company had reached out to financial services firms, regulators, central banks, policymakers, treasury and finance ministry officials and other groups to discuss the project.

“The Libra Association will work with policymakers and regulators to make sure this new ecosystem is a value-add to economies, that consumers are protected, and that the role of government oversight and central banks is appropriate. The Association is fully committed to advancing the global dialogue on how blockchain and cryptoassets should be regulated.” he wrote.

David Marcus image via CoinDesk archives",2019-07-09 21:19:19+00:00,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/investing/bitcoin-price/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Bitcoin prices have been whipsawed during the past few weeks, surging to nearly $14,000 on June 26 before plunging all the way back to about $9,600 on July 2. The price of one bitcoin has since rebounded to just north of $12,000.

Whew! What's driving this breakneck volatility?

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with ThinkMarkets FX, said that bitcoin's spike above $10,000 on June 21 sent a strong signal to average retail investors thatwas back. It was the first time bitcoin eclipsed the $10,000 level since March 2018.

Several other cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin and EOS, have soared as well.

But Lennon Sweeting, director of institutional trading with Coinsquare Capital Markets, said the recent surge also led to the subsequent drop. Larger investors looked to quickly cash in on the violent short-term moves.

""There are some key players who hold a lot of bitcoin and can rattle the market,"" Sweeting said.

Facebook validating cryptocurrencies?

Several fundamental reasons to explain the rapid moves in bitcoin and other so-called alt-coins as well.

Facebook's FB Amazon AMZN planned launch of a cryptocurrency called Libra is an event that Aslam said helps legitimize bitcoin. He said he wouldn't be surprised to seeand other big tech and retail players look to get more involved with digital currencies.

Amazon was not immediately available for comment about any possible cryptocurrency plans.

But Facebook's Libra proposal is controversial, especially since the social network is still dealing with questions about its influence on several global elections over the past few years and a scourge of fake news on the platform.

Some politicians, including Democratic Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren have even called for Facebook -- which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp -- to be broken up.

So it should come as no surprise that Congress has its sights set on Libra. A Senate Banking committee hearing about Facebook's crypto plans will be held on July 16, followed by a House Financial Services committee hearing a day later.

And Sweeting said some investors may have gotten too excited about what Libra might mean for bitcoin.

Bitcoin and the blockchain are not one and the same

He said that it's important to note that there's a difference between blockchain -- the digital ledger that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrency transactions -- and bitcoin. Facebook's Libra push might lead to a wider adoption of the blockchain, but not necessarily bitcoin.

""Some investors have viewed any positive blockchain story as being good for bitcoin,"" Sweeting said.

Still, Aslam remains bullish on bitcoin. He thinks it will soon top its all-time high of near $20,000 from December 2017, and could eventually approach $50,000 over the next few years.

His rationale? More institutional investors may start to add bitcoin to their portfolios as a hedge and a way to diversify. He notes that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange now has futures contracts for bitcoin, and that money management giant Fidelity is dipping its toe into bitcoin trading.

Aslam adds that he thinks it's only a matter of time before the Securities and Exchange Commission eventually approves an ETF backed by bitcoin.

The SEC has taken a cautious approach to proposed crypto ETFs so far and is currently reviewing several applications. But Aslam believes that all it will take is for one ETF to get the regulatory green light before the floodgates open.",2019-07-09,https://news.bitcoin.com/irs-agents-propose-draconian-tactics-to-investigate-bitcoin-users/,"IRS Agents Propose Draconian Tactics to Investigate Bitcoin Users

A recently published U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) slide describes alarming recommendations on how tax agents should deal with digital currency users who are not paying taxes. The slide recommends that agents question crypto users’ friends and family, comb through social media posts and issue subpoenas to make sure U.S. residents are paying taxes on their cryptocurrencies.

IRS Proposes Extreme Tactics for Investigating Crypto Users

An IRS slideshow created by James Daniels, IRS-CI cyber crimes program manager, describes some concerning methods IRS agents should use to crack down on crypto-using tax evaders. The slide follows the IRS’ recently announcing tax guidelines on cryptocurrencies, which will contain rules about the tax treatment of digital assets and forks. Even though the new tax guidelines haven’t been issued to the public, IRS agents who enforce the tax laws have have had no problems prosecuting bitcoin users for tax evasion. Agent Daniels’ recently published slide gives a lot of detail on how agents should combat crypto tax evaders by using a variety of investigation methods. Within the 181-page document, there are thorough descriptions of what a cryptocurrency is and chronicled paragraphs on assets like ripple (XRP) and bitcoin cash (BCH). The report discusses a myriad of digital currencies including BTC, XMR, BCH, XLM, XRP, and LTC. Daniels’ descriptive study even calls certain hardware wallet users “fanboys.”

Toward the end of the report, the slideshow explains how agents can track a bitcoin address using a public block explorer. “Once a Bitcoin Address is identified, it can be looked up on a Bitcoin Blockchain Explorer to find information such as value, transaction times, transaction locations, which may help in corroborating information, identifying additional addresses, or assist in locating the subject,” the text expounds. “It can also be used to show if bitcoins were transferred after a seizure warrant was served, which is discussed below.” Additionally, the slides give a well-documented summary of bitcoin mixers and how they are used to obfuscate trails of transactions on a public ledger. If an IRS agent determines a tax-evading suspect, the slide recommends sending grand jury subpoenas to a variety of tech companies. The slideshow states:

Issuance of a Grand Jury Subpoena should be considered for Apple, Google, and Microsoft for the Subject’s complete application download history.

Investigating a Bitcoin User’s Financial Habits

What’s more alarming is that Daniels’ slide advocates agents investigate the financial habits of individuals who are using crypto to evade taxes. This includes, but is not limited to, conducting interviews with “bank tellers, family, and friends of the subject (if feasible), and establishments the subject frequents that may accept bitcoins. [Investigating] Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets.” The IRS slide suggests searching the subject’s financial accounts, including bank, credit card, and Paypal records. “[Automated clearing house] ACHs and wire transfers should be identified to see if any of them are related to bitcoin,” Daniels’ slide suggests. The “Getting Information” section in the slide states:

Transfers to and from a subject’s Paypal account should be analyzed in much the same way, verifying the parties involved with each transaction — Vendors who accept bitcoin, such as Amazon Payments, can also be considered for subpoena. However, this method may not reliably yield results.

Further into the slides, the agent explains that if the subject in question does maintain a bitcoin balance, an attempt should be made to identify their bitcoin wallet and associated addresses. The IRS report emphasizes that a user could also have numerous crypto addresses. A person can be identified if they posted a public address on social media and the slide recommends searching “through posts by the subject on his Facebook page or Twitter account.” If the suspected tax evader uses a bitcoin wallet service, a subpoena for records could be issued to the wallet company to identify the subject’s bitcoin balance, addresses, and any identifying information. The IRS cybercrime agent also states that there are various blockchain surveillance companies available that can help with an investigation. Firms that offer distributed ledger monitoring services mentioned in the IRS slides include Chainalysis, Elliptic, and Ciphertrace.

“This software could accurately trace the history of bitcoin payments and wallets — Moreover, it is able to map wallets into known “clusters”— that is, mapping addresses to known entities like Silk Road, Coinbase, and other large Bitcoin players,” the presentation explains.

Slideshow Shows Agents Are Studying Cryptocurrency Technology Extensively

The 181-page report is a daunting display of how IRS agents can invade a person’s private life in order to prosecute them for tax evasion. James Daniels’ slides also show that the IRS is well aware of bitcoin mixers, the use of Tor, and other transaction obfuscation methods. The study gives a detailed analysis of Bitmixer.io and explains that before the site closed down it mixed 65,000 BTC per month since 2014. “In addition to Bitmixer’s website on clearnet, the operation also had an official Tor mirror as well on the deep web,” the powerpoint presentation details. The slides also give step-by-step instructions for crypto beginners and explain how agents can easily sign up for Coinbase and other popular exchanges as well as a Bitcoin ATM walkthrough.

People will likely be shocked by this display of law enforcement going to great lengths to obtain cryptocurrency information on specific people. Very few crypto users are actively taking steps to protect their privacy 100% of the time. Perhaps this slideshow will urge more people to use mixing applications like Cashshuffle, operate wallets using a VPN and make sure they keep addresses off the clearnet. The recent IRS announcement that virtual currency guidelines are on the way is all but meaningless when agents will investigate or prosecute you anyway if you don’t follow the criteria. Pay taxes or wind up in a cage.

Following G20 meetings, where Japan led several discussions regarding crypto assets, the country’s top financial regulator told news.Bitcoin.com that 110 crypto exchanges are now interested in launching in Japan. The country recently passed a new cryptocurrency bill, and some approved crypto trading platforms have undergone changes.

110 Exchanges Want to Enter Japanese Crypto Space

Under Japanese law, companies wanting to operate crypto exchanges are required to register with the country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA). There are currently 19 registrants operating in the country, 16 of which were approved in 2017 while three were approved this year. However, many more crypto exchange operators have expressed interest in entering the Japanese crypto space.

The FSA revealed to news.Bitcoin.com Monday that these businesses are in various stages of registration such as “preliminary consultation” and “inquiries regarding registration,” adding:

The number of crypto asset exchange service providers which have expressed their interest is about 110 as of June.

Among applicants waiting to be approved is Line Corporation, which owns Japan’s most popular mobile messaging app, Line. The company currently operates an exchange called Bitbox, which is available worldwide except in the U.S. and Japan due to regulation. On June 20, Bloomberg reported that the company is near obtaining approval from the FSA to offer its exchange service in Japan. However, there has been no announcement from the regulator regarding the company’s registration status.

19 Registered Crypto Exchanges

The FSA maintains a list of all registered crypto exchange operators in Japan following the country’s legalization of cryptocurrency as a means of payment in April 2017. The first 11 exchange operators were registered on Sept. 29, 2017 — Money Partners Group, Quoine, Bitflyer, Bitbank, SBI Virtual Currency, GMO Coin, Huobi Japan (formerly Bittrade), Btcbox, Bitpoint Japan, Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange, and Tech Bureau. SBI Virtual Currency Co. Ltd. changed its name to SBI VC Trade Co. Ltd. on July 1.

On Dec. 1, 2017, DMM Bitcoin, Taotao (formerly Bitarg), Bitgate, and Xtheta were registered. Bitocean followed suit on Dec. 26. No operator was registered last year, largely due to the January hack of Coincheck, one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges. Since then, the FSA has tightened its oversight of the industry including conducting on-site inspections of exchanges.

This year, three exchanges have been approved so far. Coincheck successfully registered with the FSA on Jan. 11 after it was acquired by Monex Group. On March 25, Rakuten Wallet (formerly Everybody’s Bitcoin) and Decurret were also registered.

Bitflyer Resumes Account Openings

Bitflyer, one of Japan’s largest crypto exchanges by trading volume, resumed the opening of new accounts on July 3 after freezing the service for a year due to a business improvement order it received from the FSA.

The company wrote that it “voluntarily suspended new account creation in order to reconfirm the identity of our existing customers and strengthen our internal management structure,” adding that “We would like to announce that new account creation has resumed.”

Fisco Hit With Administrative Order

It had been almost a year since the FSA last issued a business improvement order to a crypto exchange. On June 21, the agency announced an administrative order against Fisco Cryptocurrency Exchange, which acquired another registered crypto exchange, Zaif, after it was hacked in September last year. The last order prior to this latest one was issued on Sept. 25 last year to Tech Bureau, formerly the operator of Zaif.

The agency explained that it conducted an on-site inspection of the exchange on Feb. 13 and found that “management did not recognize the importance of legal compliance … this has led to a number of legal violations.” The FSA continued to detail: “there have been problems with the company’s business management system … [and] also problems in the risk management system for money laundering and terrorist financing, and the external management system such as outsourcing management system.”

The agency ordered the company to establish a number of additional systems including for legal compliance, risk management, outsourcing, handling new cryptocurrencies, protecting user information, and auditing. The company must submit its improvement plan by July 22 and follow up with monthly implementation progress reports.

Coincheck Now Supports 10 Cryptocurrencies

Coincheck applied for registration in 2017 but had been operating as a “deemed dealer” until its registration was finally approved in January. Deemed dealers are exchanges that had been operating in Japan since before the regulation took effect; the FSA has allowed them to continue service while their registration applications are being reviewed.

On Jan. 26 last year, Coincheck was hacked and lost approximately 58 billion yen (~$550 million) worth of XEM held by approximately 260,000 customers. The exchange was subsequently acquired by Monex Group and underwent extensive system improvement. Coincheck halted some services following the hack and has gradually been resuming them. The platform now supports the trading of BTC, ETH, ETC, LSK, FCT, XRP, XEM, LTC, BCH, and MONA. It started collaborating with Monex Securities in April to allow the exchange of Monex points for BTC, ETH, and XRP. Monex points are accumulated by purchasing and holding investments in Monex Investment Trusts.

FSA Warns of Unauthorized Exchanges

The FSA issued a warning on June 25 to Cielo EX Ltd. which operates a crypto exchange that has been providing service to Japanese residents without authorization. The platform offers the trading of several cryptocurrencies such as BTC and Asobi Coin (ABX). This is the fourth warning of unauthorized exchanges the agency has issued since it started regulating the crypto industry.

The other three warnings went out to Gibraltar-based SB101 on Feb. 15, Binance in March last year, and Blockchain Laboratory Ltd. in February last year.

Commitment to Applying FATF Standards

Japan recently hosted the latest G20 summit and other related ministerial meetings such as the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meetings. At the end of the G20 leaders’ summit on June 29, Japan and other G20 countries jointly declared their commitments to applying the crypto standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The country’s finance minister also joined other G20 finance ministers and central bank governors to declare the same commitment to applying FATF’s standards.

“Technological innovations, including those underlying crypto-assets, can deliver significant benefits to the financial system and the broader economy. While crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point, we remain vigilant to risks, including those related to consumer and investor protection, anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT),” the G20 leaders, finance ministers and central bank governors declared. “We reaffirm our commitment to applying the recently amended FATF standards to virtual assets and related providers for AML and CFT.”

Japan’s New Crypto Bill Passed

A new cryptocurrency bill, published on June 7, officially passed Japan’s House of Representatives, the lower house of the National Diet, on May 21. It then passed the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Diet, on May 31.

The bill entitled “A draft bill to amend some of the fund settlement laws, etc., in response to the diversification of financial transactions accompanying the advancement of information and communication technology” was prepared by the FSA. It seeks to amend two key laws that apply to crypto assets: the Act on Fund Settlement and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

The revised bill was accompanied by a resolution of 15 requests which “require the government to clarify regulatory targets, deploy appropriate personnel, implement appropriate regulations in line with the international standards, consider appropriate taxation methods, etc.,” Impress publication detailed. The FSA told news.Bitcoin.com Monday, “We are currently undergoing an extensive personnel reshuffling.”

The agency previously explained that the 15 requests are “items which we should take into consideration before introducing the bill, and we should take appropriate responses to it at the time when the bill comes into effect.”

Further, the FSA announced last month a partial revision of its operating guidelines including a business management system required for crypto exchange operators. The document also updates supervision for initial coin offerings, including when the issuers sell their own tokens and when tokens are sold on their behalf.

""It's the single best hedge against the traditional financial infrastructure,"" Palihapitiya said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC's Squawk Box. ""Whether you support the fiscal and monetary policy or not, it doesn't matter. This is the schmuck insurance you have under your mattress.""

""Just buy the coins. It's a fantastic instrument,"" he added.

Palihapitiya first bought bitcoin years ago at an average price of about $100, he previously told CNBC. The venture capitalist said he and two other friends in Silicon Valley at one point in 2013 owned 5% of the entire float of bitcoin.

He had predicted that bitcoin is going to be $1 million a piece in the next 20 years.

Bitcoin has had a stellar comeback this year, soaring more than 200% as the crypto space attracted more interest after Facebook's announcement of its own digital coin. Bitcoin tumbled more than 70% in 2018 as high-profile hacks and crackdowns on initial coin offerings dampened investor enthusiasm.

Palihapitiya is founder and CEO of Social Capital. He was a former member of the senior executive team at Facebook.",2019-07-09,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chia-releases-green-paper-detailing-eco-friendly-means-of-crypto-mining,"San Francisco-based tech firm Chia Network has released a green paper that describes an eco-friendly means of mining cryptocurrencies.

The green paper provides a description of how proof-of-space and proof-of-time create a ""Nakamoto-style"" consensus algorithm for Chia’s blockchain. Specifically, Chia proposes to “farm” rather than mine to verify blockchains that issue cryptocurrencies, wherein proof-of-space and proof-of-time take the place of the proof-of-work (PoW) principle used for mining of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The paper further explains:

“Instead of using proofs of work, Chia alternates proofs of space with verifiable delay functions. This results in a chain than in many aspects is similar to Bitcoin, in particular, as in Bitcoin no synchronisation is needed and we can prove rigorous security guarantees assuming a sufficient fraction of the resource (space in Chia, computation in Bitcoin) is controlled by honest parties.”

Initially, Chia’s CEO Bram Cohen debuted his solution to Bitcoin in late 2017, which he said resolves alleged centralization concerns with the virtual currency by employing the concept of proof-of-time. Cohen said “the idea is to make a better Bitcoin, to fix the centralization problems,” relying on a two-step block authentication method.

As reported in June, the carbon emissions generated by Bitcoin are comparable to the whole of Kansas City, and even a small country, according to a study published in the Joule journal. With annual emissions of CO2 estimated at between 22 and 22.9 megatons, Bitcoin sits somewhere between Jordan and Sri Lanka in terms of output. The study suggested that this level would double if every other cryptocurrency was also taken into account.

When trying to access the exchange through its website, users are instead greeted with the following text message in both English and Polish:

“Dear Users, We regret to inform you that due to the loss of liquidity, since 08/07/2019, Bitmarket.pl/net was forced to cease its operations. We will inform you about further steps.”

Leading cryptocurrency analytics website CoinMarketCap shows that the trading platform volume was relatively low — $850,080 in the past 24 hours. Still, it is unclear how trading is continuing while the exchange is seemingly closed. Users may still be able to trade on the platform using API keys.

Reddit user OdoBanks pointed out earlier today that the exchange has shown several red flags in the weeks leading to its shutdown. Notably, prior to the closure, users have been allegedly forced to change their passwords (without any given reason) and their API keys.

Lastly, he also claims that some withdrawal attempts have been halted with the exchange asking the users to comply with additional know-your-client (KYC) measures. In those cases the customers were reportedly asked for a scan of their ID, photo of their face holding the ID and “a note confirming that you are using bitmarket to buy bitcoin for yourself, as an investment (a new requirement).” The user also claims:

“Exchange representatives [...] claimed that this was the long overdue KYC requirement and that they were only targeting people with expired IDs. They never addressed users' accusations of hiding the fact that the exchange has been hacked.”

Bitcoin price will hit $30,000 this bull cycle and continue to a giant $100,000 in just two years, the founder of asset manager Morgan Creek has said.

$100k BTC Coming in 2021

Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Mark Yusko, founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management, delivered a fresh bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency, as the market price hit $12,800.

Yusko is also a partner and co-founder of Morgan Creek’s digital currency spin-off, Morgan Creek Digital.

“We’re definitely going to revisit old highs,” he told the network’s Fast Money segment.

Bitcoin has surprised investors this week after defying expectations of a bearish retraction to continue reclaiming lost ground from previous weeks.

Investors are currently enjoying weekly gains of 30 percent, while monthly performance has now passed 61 percent.

For Yusko, however, current activity marks just the start of 2019’s Bitcoin price action. BTC, he says, will finish this round of enthusiastic growth far above its 2017 all-time highs of $20,000.

“…I think we’re in the next parabolic move,” he continued. “That will probably take us into the $30,000 level before we get another little correction[.]”

Continuing, the investor repeated a forecast he had made during a recent webinar, arguing BTC/USD could reach $100,000 in the medium term with little effort.

“…The path to $100,000 by 2021 is really quite easy to draw out,” he concluded.

Bitcoin Price Bounces Off $12,800

Yusko was coming off bearish statements about stock markets, during which he argued a state of overselling would ultimately trigger losses. Investors were also failing to understand the reasons for a US federal interest rate cut, he said.

This week meanwhile has already seen increasingly complimentary words on Bitcoin from another major investment mogul who had previously rubbished it.

Mark Mobius, the veteran who in 2017 said cryptocurrency had no value, now said that if the Bitcoin price continues to grow, he would have to get exposure.

“At the end of the day, there are many people who do believe in it, and if it continues and grows, then I would probably have to be a buyer and be involved with this,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.

At press time Tuesday, BTC was trading at around $12,500, trending downwards from a local high of $12,800.

Earlier, trading sources, including well-known forecaster Peter Brandt, had warned that substantial downside could soon result as markets take stock of weeks of parabolic growth.

Images via Shutterstock, CNBC Fast Money",2019-07-09 12:00:24+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-posts-biggest-jump-in-12-months,"Bitcoin mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on the world’s first blockchain network – has posted its largest two-week increase in 12 months.

According to BTC.com data, mining difficulty reached 9.06 trillion (T) at block height 584,640 around 9:17 UTC on July 9, surpassing the previous record of 7.93 T by 14.23 percent. This was the strongest growth in any two-week period since August 2018 – a sign that competition among miners is not only intensifying but doing so at an accelerated rate.

The bitcoin network is designed to adjust its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (roughly 14 days) based on the participating mining power in each cycle, in order to ensure the block-producing time at the next period stays at about every 10 minutes.

When there are fewer machines competing to solve bitcoin’s hash function to earn newly created bitcoin, the difficulty will fall; when more players jump in, it rises.

Competition right now is so fierce, mining difficulty has leapfrogged the entire range of eight trillion to break the threshold of nine trillion. The estimated difficulty by BTC.com at the next adjustment period could be as high as 10.35 T, which would be another 14.17 percent increase.

Similarly, the amount of computing power devoted to securing the bitcoin network has also logged the biggest growth of any two-week difficulty adjustment cycle since August 2018, based on BTC.com data and CoinDesk’s calculations.

Enthusiasm for bitcoin mining has pushed the hash rate to as high as 74.5 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) as of July 5, in line with predictions by mining farms in China that have been plugging in machines to take advantage of cheap hydroelectric power during the rainy summer season.

The total hashing power is expected to continue rising as the peak rainy season is still months away in southwestern China, an area that is estimated to account for half of bitcoin’s global mining production.

Boom and bust

Bitcoin mining difficulty took a significant hit last year amid the market downturn. It dropped as much as 30 percent from October to December and only got back to the previous high last month.

That said, the increases in bitcoin’s hash rate and mining difficulty have not yet caught up with the pace of bitcoin’s price jump, at least not as much as they did in the bull run during the second half of 2017.

According to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index data, bitcoin’s price surged by 400 percent from around $4,000 to nearly $20,000 between June and December 2017. During the same period, the network’s computing power grew by at least 200 percent.

However, while bitcoin’s price has shot up to as much as $12,000 in June – a 300-percent jump since it fell to $3,000 early this year – the network hash rate has only increased by 100 percent over the same period.

The reason for this lag is an insufficient supply of new bitcoin mining equipment to meet the market’s demand since major miner makers are hitting a bottleneck of production capacity resulting from a limited supply of chips from semiconductor vendors.

BTC continues to chart bullish higher lows and higher highs on short duration charts, favoring a retest of the recent high of $13,880.

A move to $13,880 may take time if prices drop below key support at $12,538. That would allow a deeper pullback to $12,000.

A high-volume UTC close below $12,000 would invalidate the short-term bullish setup, although that looks unlikely.

Bitcoin (BTC) bolstered its already bullish technical setup with a move above $13,000 earlier today.

The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $13,154 in the Asian trading hours, the highest level since June 27, according to Bitstamp data.

With the move to two-week highs, BTC has recovered 85 percent of the sell-off from $13,880 to $9,614 seen in seven days to July 2.

Further, with the uptick in prices, bitcoin’s dominance rate – the leading cryptocurrency’s share of the total market – has jumped to a fresh 27-month high of 65 percent, according to data source CoinMarketCap.

As a result, the rally looks sustainable and the cryptocurrency appears on track to challenge the year-to-date high of $13,880 hit on June 26.

As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $13,000 on Bitstamp, representing 4 percent gains on the day.

Hourly and 15-minute charts

Bitcoin rallied 2.4 percent to $12,873 in 60 minutes earlier today, confirming an upside break of the symmetrical triangle – a bullish continuation pattern – on the hourly chart (above left).

With a move above the resistance at $12,883 (horizontal line), BTC also established a fresh higher high.

Therefore, the path of least resistance is on the higher side – more so, as prices reinforced the bullish breakout with a successful defense of the former hurdle-turned-support of $12,883 at 07:15 UTC.

The 15-minute chart is reporting a bull flag breakout, a continuation pattern which often accelerates the preceding uptrend. The breakout has created room for a rally to $13,868 (target calculated by adding the pole height of $878 to the breakout price of $12,990).

The rise to the recent high of $13,880, however, may not happen in the U.S. trading hours if the cryptocurrency weakens the immediate bullish case with a move below $12,538.

Daily and weekly charts

Bitcoin closed above well above $12,061 yesterday (above left), invalidating the bearish lower high created on June 28. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are again trending north, indicating a bullish setup.

The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is reporting bullish conditions with an above 50 print, and the Chaikin money flow indicator is holding well into the positive territory, indicating sustained buying pressure.

All-in-all, BTC appears on track to test and possibly break above the June 26 high of $13,880.

It is worth noting that the 14-week relative strength index (above right) is currently hovering at the highest level since December 2017, meaning BTC is most overbought in 19 months.

That, however, should not be a cause for concern for the bulls. After all, BTC’s quick recovery from sub-$10,000 levels has invalidated the bearish exhaustion indicated on the charts in the last week of June.

As the old saying goes, an overbought market can remain overbought longer than sellers can stay solvent. Indicators tend to stay overbought for a prolonged period in a strongly trending market.

Visa has reportedly led the round along with major cryptocurrency venture capital (VC) firm Blockchain Capital to support institutional-grade crypto custody service Anchorage, which previously raised $17 million in an investment led by Andreessen Horowitz.

In the new round, both the amount of Visa’s contribution and Anchorage’s private valuation were not disclosed, the report notes. Both Visa and Anchorage are founding members of Facebook’s cryptocurrency project Libra, which was officially revealed on June 18.

As Fortune noted, the recent funding round is the second known investment of Visa in a crypto-related firm, with the payment giant having participated in a $30 million funding round in blockchain startup Chain back in 2015 alongside with Nasdaq and Citi. In late 2018, Chain was acquired by Stellar-focused firm Lightyear.

The new funding will be used in Anchorage’s mission to provide an alternative to cold storage-based institutional custodies to ensure the security of customers’ assets. Instead, the company implements a system of multiple approvals and human reviews, as well as biometric-based software to provide a secure storage of crypto, the report notes.

In late May, Anchorage introduced its insurance coverage solution, opposing it to the majority of custodians that use a combination of cold and hot storage. Claiming that not all coverage of crypto custody insurance is equal, the company announced that they acquired a crime insurance policy, which covers both types of digital asset storage under one policy.

In mid-June, Visa launched “Visa B2B Connect,” a cross-border payment network derived from some aspects of blockchain technology.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/poloniex-crypto-exchange-users-can-now-use-cards-and-bank-accounts,"Major cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex announced that it now allows its customers to use credit cards and bank accounts on the platform in a Medium post published on July 9.

Per the release, exchange users from 80 countries can now directly move funds to and from their bank accounts, which will be automatically converted into stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) on Poloniex.

Initially, the weekly limits are $50,000 for deposits and $25,000 for withdrawals, but the exchange admits that those limits can be increased to fit the needs of specific customers.

Customers in more than 60 jurisdictions will be able to purchase cryptocurrencies using their debit or credit cards. Poloniex enabled card payments through a partnership with payment processor Simplex, which will charge a 3.5% fee (or $10, whichever is greater) and allow to buy a minimum of $50 of Bitcoin (BTC). The company states:

“Because Simplex charges the greater of $10 or 3.5%, buying any amount of bitcoin under $300 will result in you paying more than 3.5% in fees. If you don’t want to incur more than 3.5% in fees, buying more than $300 of bitcoin will ensure this.”

Crypto payments firm Circle purchased Poloniex in February 2018 for $400 million. At press time, Poloniex is the 58th largest cryptocurrency exchange by adjusted 24-hour trade volume according to data from CoinMarketCap.

As Cointelegraph reported in June, major fiat-crypto trading platform OKCoin partnered with Simplex to enable global users to make U.S. dollar deposits via debit or credit card.

In February, crypto exchange trade.io also offered clients the option to purchase a range of popular cryptocurrencies by credit or debit card via a partnership with Simplex.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-central-bank-wont-add-bitcoin-to-reserves-says-its-not-a-currency,"The European Central Bank (ECB) doubled down on its dismissive stance on bitcoin (BTC) July 9, refusing to recognize it as currency in a Q&A session.

Responding to a private query as part of its regular interactive Twitter program, which it administers under the hashtag ‘#AskECB,’ the bank said it had no plans to add bitcoin to its reserves.

“Bitcoin is not a currency, it rather is an asset and it is very volatile,” officials wrote quoting chief economist, Philip Lane.

The response continues the ECB’s underwhelming reaction to cryptocurrency it has already propagated in other public statements.

In May this year, a report dubbed “Crypto-Assets: Implications for financial stability, monetary policy, and payments and market infrastructures” concluded the entire phenomenon had little impact on the traditional economy.

Previously, the European Union’s reserve bank had also come out bearish on the idea of issuing a digital currency of its own, in contrast to noises now coming from China and several other states.

Predictably, cryptocurrency proponents had little time for Lane’s brief statements on bitcoin this time around.

“Bitcoin is money,” Pierre Rochard, a software engineer known for his advocacy, responded on Twitter to much appreciation.

Another user reproduced the ECB’s own inflation calculator, showing the decreasing purchasing power of the euro since its introduction twenty years ago.

That, they argued, was infinitely worse than the temporary bouts of volatility seen with bitcoin.",,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/10/18700235/cryptocurrency-venezuela-humanitarian-aid-maduro-bitcoin,"If any one image helped illustrate the unique nature of the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, it was a photograph taken in February, showing two shipping containers and a fuel tanker blocking a bridge to Colombia. The purpose of the barricade was to keep out a convoy of US-donated aid making its way to Venezuela from Bogota.

The attempted aid initiative took place in a particularly tense political context. Weeks earlier, the US had officially recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s interim president, but the government of Nicolás Maduro — which brought about the country’s economic collapse through mismanagement and corruption — clung to power.

For the Maduro regime, squashing what it saw as a politically motivated relief effort was a way to keep US and opposition influence at bay. It was also a move that tracked with Maduro’s long history of turning down humanitarian help — he often notes his is not a nation of beggars and blames economic woes on US sanctions — even as there were signs of increasingly alarming conditions inside Venezuela. As Vox’s Alex Ward reported earlier this year:

Inflation in the country now hovers above a million percent, and could reach 10 million percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Food and medicine are too expensive for many to purchase. And since 2015, more than 3 million Venezuelans have left the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere, primarily in Colombia. (It’s expected that another 2 million will become refugees in 2019 alone.)

The once-rich oil country is facing malnutrition; four out of five households live in food insecurity; and more than one in 10 Venezuelans are undernourished. And it’s grappling with the comeback of nearly eradicated tropical diseases, as well as a reduced life expectancy.

The immensity of the need in Venezuela meant that the government, in an about-face, has started allowing some streams of aid in recent months, including shipments of medical supplies and power generators from the Red Cross.

But Maduro’s refusal to formally declare a humanitarian emergency makes it impossible for many other international agencies, including UNICEF and the World Food Programme, to get involved. And the humanitarian supplies that do make it to Venezuela can’t be easily distributed where they need to get to, since basic transportation infrastructure in the country has crumbled, and soldiers often steal provisions at military checkpoints. Meanwhile, the small local aid groups that do their best to feed the hungry in the absence of significant foreign assistance are accused by officials of anti-government activism.

In that intractable landscape, Venezuelans in need have increasingly turned to a new tool to receive aid, one that facilitates the delivery of both charitable donations and remittances: cryptocurrency. As Venezuela continues sinking into the worst economic crisis in its history, it is also emerging as a unique case study for the potential of digital money to make aid possible and decrease suffering in distressed countries.

Cryptocurrency-powered aid is making a difference in Venezuela

Imagine you’re a Venezuelan living in the US. You have family members back home in Caracas, the capital, who you know are hanging in there, but desperately need some help.

But there are very few avenues at your disposal. You could try shipping packages filled with necessities, like shampoo or clothes or canned food, but there’s no guarantee that those would make it to their intended recipients. You could wire your relatives, or local nonprofits, some money, but bank transfers can take a long time, and the Venezuelan government would slap heavy fines. So, you grab your smartphone and turn to a last resort: bitcoin. That allows you to tap into a new and growing ecosystem of aid delivery in Venezuela, one that’s built entirely around direct, intermediary-free cryptocurrency transactions.

Take local charities like the Bitcoin for Venezuela Initiative or EatBCH. They receive cryptocurrency donations from around the world — incurring almost no cost or fees from intermediaries along the way — to purchase food for the needy in Venezuela. Reaching people at soup kitchens and distribution centers across the country, those two operations serve thousands of meals a day. It’s a model that is now being replicated in places like Nicaragua or South Sudan.

There’s also been experimentation with direct cryptocurrency transfers. Earlier this year, GiveCrypto, a San Francisco charity, provided temporary assistance to hundreds of vulnerable families in Venezuela through weekly crypto deposits worth around $7. Every week from February to April, families received the deposits through a smartphone app, which they were then able to trade for local currency through online transfers. As CNBC reported, that weekly infusion of digital money — equal to the monthly minimum wage in Venezuela — helped participating families stop having to skip meals.

Another initiative, spearheaded by online currency exchange platform AirTM, will “airdrop” a one-time crypto payment of $10 to 100,000 individuals in Venezuela this coming August. So far, the company has raised about $300,000 from donations toward its $1 million goal.

Cryptocurrency has also paved the way for fast, cost-effective remittances — money transfers from friends and family abroad — that elude government restrictions.

As Moises Rendon, an associate director at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, told me, remittance flows have become the second-largest source of income in Venezuela, after oil production, with about $300 million dollars coming in to the country every month from abroad. That’s made the government eager to take a cut. As Alex Gladstein writes in Time:

New laws force Venezuelans to go through local banks for foreign transactions, and require banks to disclose information on how individuals get and use their money. According to Alejandro Machado, a cryptocurrency researcher at the Open Money Initiative, a wire transfer from the United States can now encounter a fee as high as 56% as it passes from dollars to bolivares in a process that can last several weeks. Most recently, Venezuelan banks have, under pressure from the government, even prevented clients using foreign IP addresses from accessing their online accounts.

Cryptocurrency-based remittances, though, can circumvent those controls. Sending bitcoin to family members back home in Venezuela, for instance, takes moments and only incurs a small fee. Since that asset is sent directly to the recipient’s phone — as opposed to being routed through a bank or another financial institution — it is safe from government interference and can be easily liquidated through local exchanges.

Looking forward, innovation in the crypto space in Venezuela will likely only accelerate as hyperinflation remains on track to surpass 10 million percent by the end of the year, according to the IMF. After all, the dramatic collapse of the bolivar means that the logistics of making conventional payments are becoming more and more difficult; cash is scarce and traditional payment networks are overloaded. And it means that saving money is nearly impossible, because its value drops so quickly if left unused. Their own volatility notwithstanding, cryptocurrencies could help on both those fronts, especially as a growing number of merchants in the country start accepting a number of different digital currencies as payment.

As a result of all this, Venezuela already finds itself ranked as the fourth country in the world in bitcoin trade, with the average daily volume of the cryptocurrency traded on LocalBitcoins — just one of several online marketplaces where people can exchange bitcoin for local currency — reaching 5.2 billion bolivares.

As Joe Waltman, the executive director of GiveCrypto, told CNBC: “Crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken … and there’s probably no better example of broken money right now than Venezuela.”

Cryptocurrency and the future of humanitarian aid

When it comes to the potential of blockchain and digital currencies to help revolutionize humanitarian aid systems, excitement abounds.

With international relief organizations losing up to 3.5 percent of every aid transaction to different costs and fees — and with 30 percent of all development funds being lost to corruption, according to former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon — advocates say that intermediary-free cryptocurrency transactions are a less expensive way of doing business.

In addition, as direct cash interventions continue to gain traction in development circles, the kind of direct, peer-to-peer giving that blockchain technology makes so easy — and which is evident in Venezuela — can also come off as especially effective.

With nonprofits leveraging digital currency platforms to help vulnerable people in other countries as well, a growing number of donors are sitting up and taking notice.

But just as Venezuela is shining a spotlight on the humanitarian potential of cryptocurrency, it is also underlining how far away that technology still is from being able to truly revolutionize current aid systems. For one, cryptocurrency transactions depend on a functioning electricity grid and stable internet service, both of which have been far from guaranteed in blackout-ravaged Venezuela.

More operational challenges in that country — which are also present in many others in the developing world — include limited smartphone penetration and less-than-widespread computer and financial literacy. That means the humanitarian benefits of crypto are difficult to scale up.

“Basic services are not working. Many cities don’t have electricity for 10 to 12 hours every day,” Rendon says. “So yes, crypto has potential to help but the situation is so extreme that it’s hard to see the crypto benefits scaling to the level that is needed.”

Another stumbling block is that, when it comes to crypto-giving, concerns around accountability and transparency have yet to be resolved, in part because the parties involved in a transaction can largely remain anonymous.

“Anyone who tells you that they can track inside Venezuela with 100 percent accuracy and prove that a donation has been spent in two bags of food, that’s not true,” said Randy Brito, the founder of the Bitcoin for Venezuela Initiative, which uses cryptocurrency donations to buy and distribute food inside the country.

EatBCH runs a very similar operation to the Bitcoin for Venezuela Initiative. Their accountability system is to upload photos on Twitter that show folks eating donated food and a handwritten sign with the code of the transaction that helped pay for it. As Rendon notes, “That’s good enough for a few thousand dollars [in donations]. But not for like half a million dollars.”

Another obstacle that might stand in the way of cryptocurrencies’ adoption among the donor community is their somewhat dubious reputation and connection to illicit activities like money laundering. That narrative is one that recent developments in Venezuela helped perpetuate: Last year, the government tried (and failed) to launch a state-sanctioned digital currency — the petro — in large part to circumvent international sanctions.

So cryptocurrency will not be the silver bullet that resolves the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. The dimension of the hardship faced by the population is too big, and the streams of aid crypto makes possible are too new, and too difficult to expand.

That said, crypto’s ability to help put food on the table for some people — and the bigger-picture role it plays helping reestablish free market mechanisms in a damagingly repressive economic context — shows the technology’s philanthropic potential. As Rendon summed up: “It’s taking control away from the regime and empowering the people.”

If Venezuela teaches us anything, it’s that, for those living under authoritarianism or suffering from hyperinflation, bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies can be useful financial tools. That’s something that the development community should keep in mind, especially when seeking to distribute aid to crisis areas in a more efficient, faster way.

This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.

Burbank, Calif., July 10, 2019 – BitIRA — pioneer of the first insured cold storage solution for cryptocurrency retirement accounts — has launched its newest tool, the “My BitIRA” investing platform. My BitIRA maximizes the transparency and control individuals in the U.S. have over their cryptocurrency retirement accounts by granting direct access to monitor value and start transactions.

My BitIRA is a secure online portal that gives consumers the ability to track the performance of their tax-deferred cryptocurrency-based IRA whenever they choose, as well as initiate transactions. Users can view their portfolio’s performance over time — gaining real-time visibility into their returns — and they can also generate custom reports to show the investing details they value most.

This new platform makes it easier for users to have an active role in their account maintenance. Individual customers can use the funds from their IRA rollovers and other contributions to launch transactions to buy, trade or sell cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ripple, Stellar Lumens, Litecoin and ZCash. Live feeds of currency values alongside market news provide additional context for informed decision-making.

One critical feature is the ability to access wallet addresses, which allows customers to independently verify the performance of their investment.

Already established as an industry leader in security, BitIRA has been demonstrating its commitment to transparency and education. “We are dedicated to meeting the needs of our customers and continuing to demonstrate how much we value and deserve their trust,” said Jay Blaskey, Head of Sales at BitIRA. “Giving users 24/7 access to their account details and performance was the logical next step in delivering on our commitments and helping our customers get the information they need about their retirement accounts.”

Although similar customer portals are common in other industries, only two self-directed IRA companies focused exclusively on cryptocurrency retirement investing — BitIRA and BitcoinIRA — offer their customers this level of access to account management.

Customers may access “My BitIRA” for their accounts by visiting https://my.bitira.com.

Former antivirus software guru and 2020 Libertarian presidential “hopeful” John McAfee is a controversial figure, polarizing opinion in politics and culture, and taking a bold stand against the U.S. federal government. Most recently this has involved offering to help the Cuban state develop its own cryptocurrency in the interest of avoiding U.S. interventionism in trade.

Running From the State

John McAfee has been on the run since January 2019, when he fled to the Bahamas after major tax evasion charges in the U.S. According to the maverick entrepreneur, the FBI came looking for him there, and that’s when he fled to Cuba. Prior to all of this, the current presidential hopeful’s life was already riddled with scandal, tabloid press attention, and a smorgasbord of other troubles.

There was the wrongful death suit filed against him by the family of his neighbor in Belize, the drunk driving charges, and police discovering a 17-year-old girlfriend—and a house full of weapons—upon paying him a visit investigating suspected methamphetamine production. In the eyes of many, John McAfee is not what one would call a “good guy.”

Cuba Seeks to Create New Cryptocurrency

McAfee is surrounded by as many mythical stories and embellishments as he is actual facts it would seem, and maybe that’s what lends in part to his sympathy for Cuba, a country long shrouded in mystery and Westernized propaganda to foreign eyes. During an interview from his yacht harbored in Havana on July 4, McAfee told the attendant press agency that he had offered to help Cuba develop its own crypto, to get around the current U.S. embargo. Venezuela being in crisis has also knocked out significant sources of aid for the country.

On Cuban national television last week, president Miguel Diaz-Canel announced that a new cryptocurrency could aid in the economy’s recovery under Trump-tightened, decades old sanctions. Economy Minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez stated:

We are studying the potential use of cryptocurrency … in our national and international commercial transactions, and we are working on that together with academics.

A Long History of US Abuse

Since the late 19th century, Cuba has been torn and pulled apart by competing foreign interests. The Spanish-American War would be the beginning of a long and strained relationship between the U.S. and Cuban governments, setting the mold for a repeating pattern of puppet state installations, resource takeover, and clandestine intelligence operations seeking to overthrow political leadership.

After U.S.-backed Cuban president Fulgencio Batista was ousted by Fidel Castro’s revolutionary forces in December of 1958, the stage was set for further unrest and more interventionism. Although Batista had been notoriously corrupt, allowing organized crime and U.S. business and banking interests to dominate the Cuban landscape—in spite of high unemployment, water shortages, and starvation in much of the country—the American government viewed him as an ally all the same. With Castro’s revolutionary socialist government now in place, these big business and U.S. interests were effectively threatened.

Trade Wars Cost Human Lives

One of the results of this rising tension would be the infamous Bay of Pigs tragedy, illustrative of what happens when imperialist regimes seek to take control of weaker countries, and individuals in the weaker countries resist. A politicized and propagandized struggle for control of resources encouraged secret operations (which would have been viewed as despicable and politically unacceptable if shown in the light of day) and all kinds of trade restrictions, embargoes, and sanctions.

Castro had reached out to Soviet statesman Nikita Khrushchev in this context, and the Soviet Union began purchasing Cuban sugar in exchange for fuel. Though initially skeptical of Castro, the Cuban government eventually gained Khrushchev’s support, and in the volatile context of the “Red Scare” this made Cuba look all the more suspicious to Western eyes.

Clandestine CIA operations were approved by U.S. presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, involving fake Cuban resistance aircraft, manufactured “uprisings,” and attacks designed to give the appearance of internal resistance to Castro’s government, providing a justification and pretext for U.S. political involvement. Due to disorganization and internal conflict, however, the lies and deceit were made public. This was only after the fact that many on both sides, not knowing the actual situation, had died in the debacle. Both military personnel and civilians paid the price with their lives.

Why Help Cuba Now?

While many Cubans have historically idolized Fidel Castro and his leadership, and many still do, his was a dark, and violence-based state which stifled dissent via horrific and inhumane brute force. After all the propaganda is washed away, though, it seems that U.S. foreign policy is usually more interventionist. After all, the U.S. military was not forced to bring its violence to Cuba. Cuban militants from Castro’s forces were not landing on U.S. soil attempting to install puppet states there. Humanitarian aid could have been provided. Instead supplies were cut off in the interest of securing oil and Cuban sugar resources.

The current embargo against Cuba is still stifling trade, prohibiting tourism, and costing the U.S. government $1.2B per year, according to some sources. In about six decades, the embargo has cost the small island nation itself around $130B. Individuals in both the U.S. and Cuba, having nothing to do with the implementation of economic policy, or the trade starvation that modern nation states deal in, are paying the price. Viewed in this light, it makes total sense that a libertarian being stalked by the same state would want to join forces and help.

‘But McAfee Is a Scumbag…Cuba Is a Communist Nation!’

Even if both of these protests are true, the reality remains. The creation and implementation of a Cuban crypto could help many people. This isn’t about McAfee as a persona, or Cuba as the legendary communist troublemaker Americans are taught to believe it is. The importance of McAfee’s official offer is about none of this.

The most important element lies in the fact that free market actors—everyday individuals—are affected by the whims of power happy “world leaders” far away, who get to dictate what they can and cannot do with their own bodies. What they can and cannot trade of their own property. This is a fundamental violation of human rights.

This view, regardless of one’s personal opinions on McAfee, Castro, or modern-day Cuba, to tell any individual or group of individuals that they may not trade or use their property as they see fit, is always the predictor of violent conflict. As McAfee continues his flight from the IRS on his yacht, while simultaneously running for president, one salient truth remains: this is a money racket, and when someone steps out of line, they will be hunted down relentlessly. Technology moves faster, however, and voices like McAfee’s lend boldness and courage to free marketeers everywhere, waiting for it to surpass the clunky movements of the violent state.

Coinbase is exploring plans to set up its own “captive” insurance company, industry sources said.

At the start of this year, insurance broker Aon began establishing captive companies in the Cayman Islands, working with a handful of cryptocurrency firms.

Aon says a captive structure can help firms get access to additional coverage at more reasonable prices.

Insurance for crypto remains scarce, and major exchanges Kraken and Huobi say they simply self-insure by setting aside coins to cover losses from thefts or hacks.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is in talks to set up its own regulated insurance company with the help of insurance broker giant Aon, industry sources told CoinDesk.

Establishing “captive” insurance subsidiaries, wholly owned by the firm being insured, is a time-honored way for corporations to reduce costs and improve access to reinsurance markets (a form of insurance purchased by insurance companies in order to mitigate risk). Nearly all Fortune 500 companies and thousands of midsize firms maintain captives, according to a December 2018 article in trade publication CPA Journal.

Coinbase and Aon see this structure as potentially part of the answer to the shortage of insurance available to crypto exchanges, the sources said. While Coinbase has obtained more coverage than most, often exchanges just self-insure by setting aside a bunch of coins to cover losses in the event of a hack or disappearance of customer funds. The problem with that approach is its lack of a formal structure, creating the temptation to access the funds for other purposes and ambiguity about how much coverage a firm actually has.

With a captive, on the other hand, the funds are segregated and held in a regulated, audited vehicle, which can help the firm go out and attain more cover from the reinsurance market. To be clear: the captive would insure only its parent company, not competitors.

Neither Aon nor Coinbase would comment on the latter’s interest in captive insurance. However, Aon did say that it established the industry’s first crypto captive earlier this year for an unnamed client. This Caymans Islands-based captive will write “crime” policies covering hacks of hot (online) wallets and “specie” coverage for cryptocurrency kept offline in cold storage, the broker said.

The two companies have worked together before: in April, Aon helped arrange about $255 million in coverage for Coinbase’s hot wallets. The exchange, which keeps only 2% of client funds in hot wallets, held $25 billion of crypto at the height of the 2017 bullrun.

Aon said a handful of its crypto clients are considering the captive option, adding that Bermuda and some leading U.S. on-shore domiciles are expected to follow the Caymans soon.

“There is a lack of capacity and some are uncomfortable with what is available in the marketplace and are looking to alternative solutions,” said Jacqueline Quintal, a managing director and the financial institutions practice leader at Aon. “I think the path for most will be to buy some amount of traditional insurance first and then to explore alternative structures, potentially including a captive — and we are having more and more of these conversations.”

The case for captives

Stepping back, a captive is an insurance company created and completely owned by another company to provide coverage for itself. It’s a regulated alternative to self-insurance which can offer direct access to reinsurance markets and act as an investment vehicle.

If pricing is too high in the commercial insurance markets or no underwriters are willing to cover a firm’s risk, captives are used to formalize self-insurance with reporting on capital and reserve requirements.

Speaking to the advantages of using a captive rather than simple self-insurance, Quintal said: “If a firm is self-insuring, they’ve accepted responsibility for funding 100% of any loss. Captives, in comparison, provide a means through which firms can access insurance or reinsurance, while also pre-funding self-insured loss amounts in a more formal way than simply setting aside capital.”

Taking this more formal and regulated approach, Quintal added, can help create more capacity in the market, and “by having more control over a firm’s insurance program, captives can bring the price of risk financing down over time.”

Even for a crypto firm, a captive would have to keep most of its claims reserve in fiat, but crypto could potentially be used for the surplus (additional funds reserved in case of an unexpected amount of claims), according to Ward Ching, managing director, Aon Captive Insurance Managers.

There have also been discussions about including crypto in the Caymans captive’s investment activities, said Ching.

“It’s all about doing the math and showing the domicile regulatory leadership how the inclusion of cryptocurrency as an asset class both satisfies the regulatory mandate and provides financial flexibility in a constructive and safe manner,” he said.

Self-insurance

It’s no secret that many of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges simply self-insure against hacks and losses.

The problem historically has been that crypto insurance is prohibitively expensive, way too limited and fiendishly tricky when it comes to actually making a claim. In response, crypto firms have resigned themselves to holding their own coins in cold storage (where the private keys are disconnected from the internet, in a hardware device or piece of paper locked in a safe) to deal with losses.

San Francisco-based exchange Kraken has been candid about having its own insurance fund. As Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk:

“The balance sheet is basically also called the insurance fund.”

Kraken has “well over $100 million” put aside, said Powell, much of it in bitcoin to save the company from having to go out and buy coins on the open market in the event clients’ coins need to be replaced.

Similarly, in February 2018, Singapore-based Huobi put aside 20,000 bitcoin as its fallback protection mechanism in the event of a security breach, known as “the Huobi security reserve”. As a further measure, it has hoarded a “protection fund” by earmarking 20 percent of transaction fees per quarter to buy back its native tokens.

“If you add our protection fund up with our reserve fund we are talking well over $400m of protection there,” Josh Goodbody, head of Europe and the Americas, Huobi global sales and institutional business told CoinDesk.

Powell, an outspoken critic of the state of insurance provision offered to crypto firms, said over the years his firm has been quoted insurance many times at prices which were “ridiculous and obscene.”

“There’s just not a good deal out there,” he said, “I’m sure you can get someone to write you a deal for like 10% a year of the balance and actually have real meaningful coverage. But I don’t think people are going to pay that.”

Goodbody, likewise, explained that Huobi had been around the block looking at insurance. Indeed, he questioned how coverage in the hundreds of millions of dollars touted by some firms would apply to hot wallets, which he said would be “extremely confusing and full of caveats and fine print.”

Considering alternatives

Exchanges tend to be loose in how they go about self-insuring, according to Powell.

“I think everybody basically has these funds on their balance sheet and they are investing them or dipping into them for operations,” he explained. “Nobody, as far as I know, has provided some sort of audit or an explicit statement about how these funds are segregated and kept in a different entity as if it were really like third party insurance provider.”

Nevertheless, Powell said he struggled to see what value it would add setting up a separate captive insurance company.

“I just feel like it’s moving money between pockets of the same entity, and I don’t really see how this actually helps the consumer have more protection. It’s all the same basket of money anyway,” said Powell. “I don’t know why this would be able to get a better deal than we could get directly with an insurance broker.”

Huobi’s Goodbody was more optimistic, calling Aon’s plans “extremely interesting and super positive for the market.”

Some innovators in the insurance space, such as ethereum-based Nexus Mutual and also Etherisc (another partner of Aon), have suggested going further than setting up individual captive vehicles and rather pooling together groups of crypto disaster funds into a system of reinsurance.

Powell agreed this idea seemed to have more potential value for the industry, but he questioned the practicalities.

“You could conceivably do a group insurance deal among the exchanges, like a co-operative kind of thing. But then you have to have your competitors audit everything and I think everybody’s too smart for that – and too paranoid,” he said.

Aon’s Ching agreed there was some “obvious logic” in getting a group of crypto self-insurers together and aggregating. The problem, he said, is these companies are very different once you get under the covers:

“They have different risk tolerances, different capital structures and different security mechanisms. Until they harmonize that it’ll be hard to put a group captive together; not saying it’s impossible, just a bumpier ride.”

In a series of tweets, Trump expanded on his thoughts on crypto, saying Facebook’s newly announced Libra virtual currency “will have little standing or dependability,” and that the company should seek a banking charter and be regulated like any other traditional financial institution. Incidentally, that puts Trump on the side of House Democrats, a group of which last week officially asked Facebook to put its Libra plans on hold so it can be properly investigated for risks to the global financial system.

Naturally, Trump ended his crypto fireside chat with some trademark, nationalistic confidence in the United States Dollar. “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar,” he wrote.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

It’s not clear why Trump chose today of all days to speak out about crypto. The White House spent the afternoon hosting a gathering of disgruntled conservatives invited to come listen to him complain about bias and commiserate in apparent censorship on behalf of platform-owning tech companies. Perhaps there was some talk of Bitcoin and Libra at this meeting.

Whatever the source of Trump’s sudden ire for crypto, one crowd is not particularly happy: the alt-right, which has enough libertarian and more broadly anti-government strains in its movement to align with crypto enthusiasts. (Also, payment processors have begun taking sides in the deplatforming debate, banning sites known to promote white supremacy, violence, and neo Nazism. So that’s also made crypto popular with the online breeding grounds for those movements.)

The official Twitter account for extremist forum Gab, which was banned from using PayPal last October, has been on a tirade since Trump’s tweets went out, complaining of a so-called “Kushner Presidency” influencing Trump’s decision to smear Bitcoin and comparing Gab’s free speech absolutist social network to the popular cryptocurrency, as both are “smeared by the media” and “built to preserve and promote freedom.”

Trump echoed many critics of cryptocurrencies, questioning how bitcoin is valued and highlighting its price volatility. Many argue that those attributes count against the wider adoption of digital currencies.

Cryptocurrencies ""are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,"" said Trump.

In the last 24 hours alone, the price of bitcoin against the dollar saw movements that would spark worries if they were seen in any major national currency: It touched a high of $12,033.74 and a low of $11,142.79, according to industry data site CoinDesk.

The president said the ""dependable and reliable"" U.S. dollar should be the ""only one real currency in the USA.""

Trump tweeted Thursday that he is “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies, saying they were “not money” and referencing their price volatility relative to the dollar in his first public comments on crypto since becoming president of the United States.

Trump also criticized Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project in subsequent tweets, saying it “will have little standing or dependability” and suggesting U.S. regulators would subject the social media giant to regulation:

“If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National […] and International.”

(Facebook subsidiary Calibra, which is supposed to develop an open-source wallet for the cryptocurrency, has registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.)

Trump has criticized Facebook in the past for its actions in banning right-wing figureheads, alongside other social media outlets. To date, however, he has not discussed Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans. The company first publicly released its white paper and supporting documentation for Libra last month.

The 45th president held a “social media summit” earlier on Thursday, addressing these concerns.

Regulators and lawmakers across the U.S. have taken notice of Libra, with both the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee scheduling hearings next week with Facebook’s blockchain lead David Marcus.

The Senate committee in particular has previously expressed concerns about Facebook’s track record with user data and privacy, writing an open letter to the company in May. Marcus responded to the letter earlier this week, telling the lawmakers that Facebook would not itself collect any personal financial credentials.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell also said that Libra should not be allowed to move forward unless and until the company addresses anti-money laundering and know-your-customer concerns, among other issues.

Financial stability is also a factor that Powell addressed, with lawmakers in both houses questioning the fact that Facebook has set up an entity in Switzerland affiliated with the project.

Facebook declined to comment on Trump’s comments.

‘Unlawful behavior’

In his tweets Thursday, Trump took aim at the potential for using cryptocurrencies in illegal activities, citing drug trafficking in particular.

“Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,” he said.

In a final tweet, he added:

“We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!”

While Trump himself had yet to weigh in on cryptocurrencies prior to Thursday, his Treasury Secretary has been a strong proponent of greater cryptocurrency regulations.

Steven Mnuchin has been calling for greater crypto regulation since the beginning of 2018, calling on the G20 to take up the issue during an (at the time) upcoming meeting in March.

This year, the Financial Action Task Force published guidance for central banks, calling for stringent know-your-customer information collection practices. The U.S. Treasury Department held the FATF presidency until the end of June.

“We will not allow cryptocurrency to become the equivalent of secret numbered accounts [and] we will allow for proper use, but we will not tolerate the continued use for illicit activities,” Mnuchin said in remarks prior to the rules’ publication.

In contrast, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney has previously called for a more lenient regulatory framework, saying, “if we over-regulate and discourage people from entering the marketplace, that has bad consequences.”

Bitcoin suffered a significant drop in the last 24 hours, but the higher-lows pattern on the daily chart is still intact and the outlook remains bullish.

A daily close below the July 2 low of $9,615 would invalidate the bullish higher-lows pattern and confirm a bearish reversal.

The case for a drop to $9,615 would strengthen if BTC prints a UTC close below $11,550 today, validating Wednesday’s bearish outside day candle.

A high-volume wedge breakout on the hourly chart, if confirmed, would imply an end of the pullback and yield a move back above $12,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped sharply in the last 24 hours, however, the outlook remains bullish with prices holding well above key support near $9,600.

The top cryptocurrency by market value ran into a flood of offers near $13,200 yesterday and fell to a low of $11,164 on Bitstamp earlier today.

Media outlets have associated the sharp pullback with the US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments that Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra “cannot go forward” until serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability are addressed.

While there is no concrete evidence to link bitcoin’s drop with Powell’s comments, the price action does paint a picture that indicates the sell-off was triggered by Powell’s remarks.

As noted by CNBC Journalist Ryan Browne, BTC began falling rapidly from $12,900 immediately after Powell started talking on Libra at 14:30 UTC yesterday.

That said, the bulls were already looking tired, having faced multiple rejections above $13,100 ahead of Powell’s testimony, as noted by CoinDesk Markets, meaning the pullback was expected. Powell’s remarks may have ended up deepening the price slide.

Looking forward, the outlook will remain bullish as long as the price is held above the higher low of $9,615 created on July 2. Renowned crypto market analyst Tone Vays mentioned $10,000 as the level to defend for the bulls.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,500 on Bitstamp, representing a 10 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

Daily chart

BTC created a bearish outside day candle on Wednesday, which occurs when the day begins with buyers in control only to end on a bearish note, engulfing the high and low of the preceding day.

A bearish outside day is widely considered an early warning of a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The reversal, however, is confirmed only if prices close below the candle’s low on the following day.

The focus, therefore, is on today’s UTC close. The bearish outside day pattern would gain credence if prices print a close below $11,550.

That would shift risk in favor of a drop to the bullish higher low of $9,615 (July 2 low). The outlook would turn bearish only if and when the price finds acceptance below that level.

BTC, however, could close well above $11,550 today as the pullback seen in the last 24 hours has taken the shape of a bullish reversal pattern, as seen in the chart below.

Hourly chart

BTC looks to have created a falling wedge pattern, which comprises of contracting trendlines connecting lower highs and lower lows.

The contraction of the range indicates sellers are losing steam. As a result, a wedge breakout is considered a bullish reversal pattern.

A high-volume break above the upper edge of the wedge, currently at $11,500 would confirm a breakout and allow a rally back to immediate resistance at $12,200 (horizontal line). A violation there would expose Wednesday’s high of $13,200.

Speaking about Facebook Libra, the twins, who co-founded cryptocurrency trading platform Gemini, said it was only a matter of time before other tech giants followed suit.

FANG refers to the unofficial “Big Four” of the internet: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.

“Our prediction is every FANG company will have some sort of cryptocurrency project within the next two years,” Tyler told the network.

Libra as a payment protocol has not yet launched, but regulators have voiced alarm, particularly in the United States, where several sources have demanded developers halt the project.

Concerns stem from Libra’s potential to bypass the banking system, something cryptocurrency proponents conversely argue makes the banking establishment overly nervous about losing revenue.

On Thursday, Bitcoin (BTC) itself shed over 10% of its value after a senior U.S. lawmaker delivered fresh concerns about Libra.

For the Winklevosses, however, front-door approaches to regulators is key in getting any disruptive finance offering to market.

Though many say it is not a cryptocurrency at all, the twins even suggested they would facilitate trading of Libra on Gemini, should it be open and not subject to prohibitive restrictions.

“We’ll evaluate Libra in earnest, and it might actually be an asset that is one day listed if it’s an open protocol; that’s possible,” Tyler continued.

Earlier this week, Tom Lee, a serial Bitcoin advocate, delivered a similar forecast regarding tech giants’ future involvement in the digital currency industry.

In an official blog post published July 10, the internet browser developer revealed that users of Opera for Android can now send and receive BTC, TRX and TRC-10 standard tokens and that webpages can also request and receive addresses for users to complete transactions with BTC.

Opera characterizes this second functionality as “an experimental integration of Web 3” — a term that was initially coined to refer to the ambition to develop a semantic internet, and is increasingly used to refer to the evolution of a more intelligent, open and distributed web, involving the use of blockchain, decentralized computing and cryptocurrencies.

While Opera’s built-in crypto wallet had already supported Ether (ETH) and ERC standard tokens, the company’s blog post implies that bringing bitcoin support to Web 3.0 will encourage the asset to be used not only for speculation and the storage of value, but for payments.

Ahead of the Android launch, Opera had initially launched TRX and TRC-standard token support for its built-in crypto wallet this May.

As Cointelegraph has reported, Opera has incrementally rolled out multiple developments of Web 3.0, wallet and decentralized application (DApps) interactions for its suite of browsers.

In parallel, the firm has continued to explore the development of future blockchain applications within its other products and ecosystem, notably via a partnership with blockchain advisory and financial services firm Ledger Capital.

Other major players in the blockchain-powered smartphone sphere notably include electronics supplier Sirin Labs — which launched its first blockchain-based smartphone last winter, offering a cold-storage crypto wallet and support for encrypted communications.

This spring, consumer electronics giant HTC also rolled out in-wallet cryptocurrency trading for users of its blockchain-powered Exodus 1 smartphone as well as its Exodus 1S smartphone with Bitcoin full node capability.

If an investor purchased $1,000 in crypto at the market’s top how much would their investment be worth at today’s prices?

During 2017, the crypto markets came to a head as the confluence between rising prices, media attention, feverish initial coin offerings, and 100x altcoin breakouts lead the market to crescendo to highs yet to be matched again.

During that time, investors could have easily quintupled their money in the months leading up to the market peak. Thousands of retail investors were swept-up in the mania. Investors mortgaged their homes, maxed out their credit cards, and sold their belongings thinking the parabolic growth would continue.

These investors were incinerated as the markets plummeted. It would be over a year before the markets stopped hemorrhaging.

Now as the cryptocurrency markets rally, how would an investor have fared if they made a $1,000 investment at the peak of the market?

A look at the numbers

Below is the list of cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization at the market peak on Jan. 7, 2019. At the time, common advice was to use market capitalization as a proxy for the perceived ‘safeness’ of each investment. Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum were even considered the ‘blue chips’ of crypto, signifying their soundness. Yet, a year later, the returns tell a different story.

In order of top 10 by market capitalization on Jan. 7, 2018:

By best performers:

The performance of these assets since January 2018 could be attributed to a variety of different technical and fundamental factors.

Bottom performers

3/4) IOTA and XRP: Pundits described IOTA and XRP as two of the most “hyped” projects of the 2017 bull market.

Both coins saw unsustainable parabolic growth to their prices. From Nov. 1st, MIOTA went from $0.378 to $4.07—a 10-fold increase. XRP went from $0.20 to $3.38—a 16-fold increase. For reference, over the same time span, the overall market capitalization increased from $170 billion to $835 billion, under a 4-fold increase.

Both projects were appealing because of their technological answers to solving the blockchain scalability problem. In December 2017 CryptoKitties clogged the Ethereum network, while Bitcoin average transaction fees hit a high of $55 that same month.

Both projects also tackled attractive niches: internet-of-things and banking. As the markets corrected, investors may have realized that these solutions were still far from widespread market traction.

2) Cardano: Ada was also a bottom performing digital asset. Some of the losses could be attributed to conflicts between the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo that resulted in lackluster community management until late 2018.

Alongside IOHK and Emurgo, the Cardano Foundation is one of the primary governing bodies for Cardano. One of the Foundation’s primary responsibilities is marketing and driving brand awareness to the project.

And, up until 2019, it largely failed according to the community. The Foundation was embroiled in controversy as it failed to meet most of its self-described targets. These failures resulted in community outrage. Petitions called for the removal of Foundation chairman Michael Parsons and gained thousands of signatures, and Parsons soon after resigned. In May 2019 Cardano continued to make strides in improving its community presence.

Other reasons for poor performance may relate to Cardano’s philosophy of slow, but methodical, platform development. Cardano did not deploy its mainnet until October of 2018. IOHK has continued to maintain its strategy of slow, albeit consistent development.

1) NEM: A $1,000 investment in NEM would be worth a mere $43 today. NEM’s niche was largely as a white-label token issuance platform that allowed anyone to launch their own cryptocurrency with “no programming needed.” The platform was arguably outdone by Ethereum as the majority of ICOs and new token launches happened on the ETH blockchain.

The NEM Foundation, the community’s nonprofit meant to promote the blockchain, was also “mismanaged,” further exacerbating the platform’s decline.

“Basically we realized we had a month to operate, due to the mismanagement of the previous governance council,” said Alex Tinsman, who took over as president of the Foundation in January of 2019.

Top performers

3) Ethereum: The incumbent smart contract platform has been relatively salient to losses compared to other top 10 market capitalization investments. From a technical perspective, this may have to do with its strong correlation to Bitcoin price movements.

According to Longhash and BitInfoCharts, Ethereum is one of the most strongly correlated assets to Bitcoin. Nevertheless, upwards moves for BTC tend to have less of an impact (but still larger than other cryptos) on ETH, and smaller retracements tend to result in gains relative to BTC. However, large downward moves for Bitcoin tend to have an even larger impact on Ethereum.

From a fundamental level, Ethereum’s appreciation could stem from the continued development of the ecosystem and sustained developer growth. Ethereum still leads in terms of the number of active developers working on the platform and the platform has continued to make steady progress towards proof-of-stake ETH 2.0.

2) Litecoin: The silver to Bitcoin’s gold has seen an astronomical rally over the last quarter largely attributed to the upcoming LTC halving on Aug. 5. The strong movement may reflect a change in investor’s perception of Litecoin’s scarcity as the mining emission rate for the coin drops.

That said, if history repeats itself LTC could see a major correction. As the halving becomes “priced in” it is possible for the market to overreact to the news and push LTC into overbought territory. If so, Litecoin could experience a drop similar to the 73 percent correction leading up to the first halving in July 2015.

1) Bitcoin: The predominant cryptocurrency has by far lead in terms of performance. Part of the reason may stem from Bitcoin’s typical role in market cycles. Although, enthusiasts claim that Bitcoin’s features and salience are the reason for its recent performance.

Based on previous bull markets, altcoins do not peak until Bitcoin finishes its rally. During the 2017 bull market, the altcoins that more closely correlated with BTC—Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash—peaked in December, shortly after Bitcoin. Ethereum and XRP followed in January.

Since the market trend only reversed from bearish to bullish in May, some pundits bullish on “altseason” have suggested that altcoins will continue to underperform until BTC peaks.

Several top crypto-influencers have asserted a meaningful counterpoint. The markets may have “learned its lesson” on altcoins since the last boom and bust, claiming altcoins may never see another parabolic market.

Here are 10 of the best replies.

Trump Tweetstorm Sparks a Thunderous Response

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” began Donald Trump, never one to mince his words or check his facts before hitting send. “Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.” He went on to pillory Facebook’s Libra currency, asserting that a banking charter is required to engage in money transmission. Then came the kicker, draped in the stars and stripes and dispatched on the wings of a bald eagle:

We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!

As several million people were exposed to Bitcoin for the first time, 15,000 who were already familiar with the benefits of cryptocurrency took to Twitter and set President Trump right on a few matters.

‘Cryptocurrency Is Used by Criminals’

To counter the second of Trump’s misleading claims (the first being that the value of bitcoin is based on ‘thin air’), one user directed the president towards a series of images dispelling the notion that cryptocurrency is crims’ currency of choice:

Others attacked the U.S. dollar’s diminishing value against bitcoin by linking to usdsat.com.

And then there were those who targeted broader issues, such as America’s role in causing global instability through phony drug wars, unwarranted drone attacks, dragnet surveillance and operating a de facto financial cartel.

Many bitcoiners, however, were simply content in the knowledge that ‘the virus’ was spreading, and tomorrow millions would awaken with their curiosity piqued by Bitcoin’s capabilities.

As Nic Carter, addressing the tribalistic battleground that is crypto Twitter, put it, “For one glorious moment we were united.”

Last month, Facebook announced that it would launch Libra, aimed at consumers around the world who don't have bank accounts. The currency is managed by a network co-founded by several companies, including Facebook, eBay, Uber, Lyft, PayPal and Visa.

Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin was up more than $2 as of Friday morning.

Trump is not the only one to voice concerns about Facebook's Libra currency. During a congressional committee hearing this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Libra raises ""serious concerns"" regarding issues such as privacy and consumer protection, CNBC reports.

""These are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed,"" Powell said.

The controversial billionaire–cum–leader of the free world shared his disdain with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Facebook’s upcoming Libra in a string of tweets earlier today.

Trump said cryptocurrencies were not money and took issue with their highly volatile value “based on thin air,” as well as their potential to facilitate criminal activity.

I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

Why Trump is wrong

There are many reasons why Trump‘s arguments are short-sighted. Although Bitcoin (pseudoanonymous) has been used to fund criminal activity, cash (completely anonymous) has been used for the same purpose for a lot longer.

Trump‘s assertions are largely based on Bitcoin‘s decentralized nature, and his belief that a third-party such as a government must control the issuance of money.

– Fiat has value because it’s backed by government’s credibility.

– Government’s credibility + power + army are backed by “consensus”.

– Bitcoin‘s value is backed by consensus.

Think before arguing against #btc’s value. “Value/Power” in this world is about consensus. — Jimmy Zhong (@jimmyzhong_iost) June 28, 2019

Financial instruments need to be backed by something. Commodities do not. Bitcoin is a digital commodity, similar to gold in many ways. Hence, it does not need to be backed by anything besides itself. Bitcoin simply “is”. The “bitcoin is backed by nothing” argument is absurd. — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) June 10, 2019

It’s not surprising that Trump – like many politicians and financial bigwigs – has an issue with cryptocurrency, but his less-than-favourable track record with tech does beg the question of whether he actually understands the inner workings of the technology (or even its underlying economics).

While most politicians are quick to criticize cryptocurrency, their inherent volatility, and lack of centralization, it goes without saying that the systems they represent are far from perfect.

Bitcoin, for example, came into existence in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 global financial crash, a crisis so deep that it’s considered by many economists to have been the most serious downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

While theories about its causes abound, many point the blame towards a flawed political and economic model characterized by subprime lending, deregulation, and the collapse of the housing market.

So, while Bitcoin is probably not the answer to all these problems, it’s sad for Trump to criticize it so dismissively.

Bitcoin may not be controlled by a government, but it’s backed by cryptography and decentralized, rigorous consensus.

What kind of stocks stir up controversy like no other? Penny stocks. These tickers trading for less than $5 per share have earned a reputation as some of the most divisive names on Wall Street, with these plays either met with open arms or given the cold shoulder.It’s understandable why some investors are wary. Those opposed are quick to point out that there could be a very real reason these stocks are changing hands for pocket change, with the low share prices often masking obstacles like weak fundamentals or troubling headwinds. That said, others are drawn in by the sheer growth potential of penny stocks. The fact is that even minor share price appreciation can mean huge percentage gains, and thus, serious returns. What’s more, your money goes further with these bargain names.No matter which side you take, one thing is certain, due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions. That’s where the experts come in, namely the analysts at Roth Capital. These pros bring experience and in-depth knowledge to the table.With this in mind, our focus turned to two penny stocks that have received a thumbs up from Roth Capital analysts. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, both have been cheered by the rest of the Street as well, as they boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Not to mention substantial upside potential is on the table.Cellectar Biosciences (CLRB)Leveraging its patented phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) delivery platform, Cellectar Biosciences develops cutting-edge treatments for cancer. Based on the potential of its drug candidate, CLR 131, and its $1.24 share price, Roth Capital thinks that now is the time to get in on the action.Representing the firm, analyst Jonathan Aschoff tells clients that he is optimistic about CLR 131, which is a small-molecule, targeted PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells, in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) indications. According to Aschoff, following its Type B guidance meeting with the FDA, “CLRB is prepared to initiate its first pivotal CLR 131 trial in LPL/WM after achieving a 100% ORR and 75% major response rate in four patients.” He points out that although CLRB just reported promising results in multiple myeloma (MM) (40% ORR in triple class refractory (TCR) patients at total body doses of at least 60mCi), LPL/WM was selected for the initial pivotal trial based on the very strong initial results and the lower competition for patients.“We view this as a prudent decision because NCCN compedia listing in MM is a mere peer-reviewed publication away, if first approved in LPL/WM. We also note that CLRB has steadily improved its dosing of CLR 131, essentially fractionating the doses so that higher total body doses are well tolerated,” Aschoff further explained. Adding to the good news, the therapy generated activity in preliminary Phase 1 unresectable brain tumors. Aschoff added, “Disease control was shown in two heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas, showing the drug's ability to cross the blood brain barrier, and all doses through 60 mCi/m2 have exhibited a favorable safety profile.”To this end, Aschoff rates CLRB a Buy along with a $10 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 713%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Aschoff’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. 5 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: CLRB is a Strong Buy. Given the $5.48 average price target, shares could soar 345% from current levels. (See CLRB stock analysis on TipRanks)Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC)With vast gene therapy experience, Applied Genetic Technologies designs and constructs all critical gene therapy elements and brings them together to develop successful treatments for patients. Currently going for $4.50 apiece, Roth Capital believes this stock’s long-term growth narrative is strong.Firm analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out that recently released data for its XLRP gene therapy program, which is expected to enter pivotal studies in Q1 2021, reaffirmed his bullish thesis. “Despite the market not fully appreciating the data given how the stock traded, we continue to believe that the results suggest that AGTC could have a best-in-class therapy, which is supportive of the planned pivotal efforts,” he explained.Providing an update on the results of the Phase 1/2 XLRP study, using the FDA's criteria, AGTC evaluated responses at 12 months in the lower dose groups (2 and 4), and 6 months in the higher dose groups (5 and 6). According to Jallah, “initial responses were observed in dose Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with impressive response durability even at 12 months.”On top of this, at 6 months, the dose used in Group 5 resulted in a 43% response rate or a 57% response rate if excluding a patient not meeting the enrollment criteria. In Group 6, a response rate of 50% was observed, or 100% excluding patients not meeting the enrollment criteria.Jallah added, “All measurements were obtained in the 36 perimetry grid, which we believe should make it easier to preselect loci likely to respond. Although BCVA is not the primary endpoint, BCVA improvements, which can capture changes in the central region, were maintained at 12 months.”Even though some investors have expressed concern about Meira’s competing therapy, Jallah believes AGTC’s technology could have a leg up. “Overall, we believe that the data from both companies is strongly indicative of the efficacy potential of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease, and although differences in the study design makes direct comparisons difficult, we believe that AGTC could have a competitive advantage heading into pivotal studies,” he commented.In line with his optimistic approach, Jallah reiterated a Buy rating and $30 price target, indicating 568% upside potential. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here)All in all, other analysts echo Jallah’s sentiment. 5 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $18.25 is less aggressive than Jallah’s but still leaves room for upside potential of 306%.

It is very important to do your own analysis before making any investment.",,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-bitcoin-still-valuable-cryptocurrency,"How is it that the “first draft” of peer-to-peer digital cash — bitcoin — is still the most valuable of all cryptocurrencies?

Many digital currencies were invented with the purpose of improving upon the perceived shortcomings of bitcoin, such as transaction latency and high levels of energy consumption. Yet, the Bitcoin blockchain has never been hacked, and it remains the core of the crypto ecosystem. It is often the first currency crypto newbies buy when they set up a Coinbase account. Funds are raised and stored in bitcoin by blockchain-based startups. And bitcoin is habitually used as a “base currency” for trading cryptos on exchanges.

What has contributed to bitcoin’s uninterrupted reign as king of all cryptos? I’d like to make the case that it comes down to three essential factors: elegant design, the solving of a real problem and resilience.

Bitcoin’s Elegant Design

Darwin’s theory of evolution is frequently described as “elegant” by scientists because, when it comes down to it, the theory is a very simple explanation for the diversity of life. Bitcoin’s design reflects a similar elegance. It addresses the issue of inflation that plagued previous iterations of digital cash by appealing to the basic economic principle of supply and demand. The number of bitcoin that will ever be created is capped at ~21 million. This limited resource model has led many to characterize bitcoin as “digital gold.” The reference also alludes to the way in which new bitcoin are created — a process called mining, which factors into the second reason why bitcoin remains seated atop the crypto throne.

Bitcoin Solves a Real Problem

Bitcoin was not the first digital currency to be invented, but it was the first to successfully solve the double-spend problem. Before bitcoin there was eCash, Hashcash, Bit Gold and b-money, among others. These earlier attempts at digital money introduced the following concepts that formed the foundation for Bitcoin:

Public key for encryption and a private key for decryption

Hashing, or the creation of an anonymous string of numbers and letters to stand for a transaction via a proof-of-work algorithm

Decentralized tracking of ownership by broadcasting transactions to a network of computers that all hold a copy of the same ledger

Problematically, none of the previous versions of internet money prevented “double spending,” where one user could send the same coin to two different users by executing the transactions simultaneously.

Legacy financial systems rely on banks as “trusted” third parties to verify transactions. However, banks often charge high fees for transfers (particularly cross-border transactions). Furthermore, if the 2008 financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that banks will always prioritize their own interests over those of their customers.

Bitcoin solves the double-spend problem by injecting transparency into the financial system. All transactions are verified by a majority of nodes in the decentralized network and recorded in chronological order with each transaction referencing the transaction proceeding it. When users can see every transaction that has ever occurred, an attempted double spend is immediately recognized as not matching those of the longest chain, and it is rejected. The only danger to the system is if a majority of nodes collude to accept an illegitimate version of the chain. Bitcoin’s built-in incentive model for miners is constructed to deter against such a 51 percent attack.

Miners are rewarded for performing the essential function of block creation with newly minted bitcoin and fees in bitcoin. If the network is compromised in any way, the bitcoin that miners earn in rewards would be devalued — a pretty clever mechanism for discouraging miners from undermining the network.

Bitcoin’s Resilience

The theories powering the Bitcoin network are elegant and brilliant, but more importantly they have been proven to work in practice. Some readers may remember the years when bitcoin was worth less than a dollar, followed by years of dramatic price fluctuations. There have been numerous hacks to exchanges with billions of dollars worth of bitcoin lost. Despite these tests, bitcoin is still the most widely used and valuable cryptocurrency. Even now, as the network faces new obstacles, it has proven its resilience time and time again.

Today, the biggest challenge may be the fact that bitcoin mining has become incredibly costly and energy consumptive. In a demonstration of adaptability, many mining operations are leaning into renewables to lower their energy costs and generate better ROI. Interestingly, bitcoin miners’ increasing use of renewable energy sources has made the Bitcoin industry a leader in sustainability and may even be influencing faster development of sustainable energy solutions for the entire planet.

Bitcoin Is Here to Stay

No doubt Bitcoin’s elegant design, the fact that it solves a real problem and its demonstrated resilience will ensure its longevity. However, beyond these factors, there is something more important happening. Unique among technologies, Bitcoin embodies a set of values in its very construction: transparency, privacy and the empowerment of individuals to control their own monetary destiny. It’s hard to measure how much these values matter as reason for Bitcoin’s success to date, but sometimes it is the immeasurable qualities that lead innovations to have the greatest impact.

Opinions expressed are entirely his own and do not necessarily reflect those of BTC Inc or Bitcoin Magazine.",2019-07-12 19:10:36+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-industry-celebrates-achievement-unlocked-as-trump-pumps-market,"Donald Trump saying he is not a fan of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency is “yuge” for the industry, commentators were suggesting after new tweets on July 12.

In the hours after the United States’ president delivered his lackluster appraisal of crypto, the Bitcoin price stayed stable, only to then begin growing to hit 1% gains Friday.

Negative or not, for proponents, the event marked a psychological milestone for Bitcoin, as Trump had previously held off from mentioning it in public.

The fact that he felt the need to bash Bitcoin publicly feeds the narrative that it is both independent of global powers and unable to be crushed by them, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated, leading the responses.

“Achievement unlocked! I dreamt about a sitting U.S. president needing to respond to growing cryptocurrency usage years ago. ‘First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.’ We just made it to step 3 y'all,” he tweeted.

Armstrong exemplified the buoyant mood among Bitcoiners. Others likewise thanked Trump for the free publicity, noting a surge in interest documented by Google Trends, while the president being wrong in his opinion also became a talking point on social media.

“Congratulations BTC community — the president of the United States feels we are worthy of a tweet now,” cryptocurrency entrepreneur, Simon Dixon, added. “Bitcoin has outperformed USD by 23,440,508% since it started being priced in USD.”

Max Keiser, the RT host and regular Bitcoin bull, considered Trump to have nullified his chances of reelection in 2020, while eToro senior analyst, Mati Greenspan, described his words as an “early nomination for the most bullish tweet of the year.”

Despite the conversely more stable price performance since the tweets, the possibility of a ‘Trump pump’ occurring for Bitcoin was also gaining traction among analysts.

“Trump is bullish for Bitcoin generally because his media tactics wobble geo-political uncertainty. Thanks for all the dollars flowing into Bitcoin,” cryptographer and Hashcash inventor, Adam Back, added.

In the meantime, another, lesser-known cryptocurrency took the opportunity to capitalize on the buzz. TrumpCoin (TRUMP), an altcoin all but unknown since it appeared in March 2016, was up 28% Friday.",,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/12/tokyo-cryptocurrency-exchange-hack-bitpoint-bitcoin,"A cryptocurrency exchange in Tokyo has halted services after it lost $32m (£25m) in the latest apparent hack on volatile virtual monies.

Remixpoint, which runs the Bitpoint Japan exchange, discovered that about ¥3.5bn in various digital currencies had gone missing from under its management.

The apparent hack emerged after an error appeared in the firm’s outgoing funds transfer system on Thursday night. It said the cryptocurrency went missing from a so-called hot wallet, which is connected to the internet, but that currency held in cold wallets that are offline was not affected.

Q&A What is cryptocurrency? Show Cryptocurrencies are an alternative way of making payments to cash or credit cards. The technology behind it allows the ‘money’ to be sent directly to others without it having to pass through the banking system. For that reason they are outside the control of governments and are unregulated by financial watchdogs – and transactions can be made in a way that keeps you reasonably pseudonymous. If you own a crypto-asset you control a secret digital key that you can use to prove to anyone on the network that a certain amount of that asset is yours. If you spend it, you tell the entire network that you have transferred ownership of it, and use the same key to prove that you are telling the truth. Over time, the history of all those transactions becomes a lasting record of who owns what: that record is called the blockchain. Bitcoin was one of the first and biggest cryptocurrencies and has been on a wild ride since its creation in 2009, surging in value as investors piled in, drawing comparisons with the tulipmania of the 17th century before it crashed. Sceptics warn that the lack of central control make crypto-assets ideal for criminals and terrorists. The number of crypto-assets has grown rapidly, including from several major companies. JP Morgan has built its own cryptocurrencies, while trading in traditional financial assets that track the value of cryptocurrencies – such as derivatives and contracts for difference – has also become available. Facebook is planning to launch its own digital currency – Libra – in 2020. Richard Partington and Martin Belam

The exchange handles various virtual currencies, including bitcoin, ethereum and ripple. Remixpoint said it was analysing the loss and gave no further details on the incident.

This is the latest hack involving cryptocurrencies, which have become synonymous with vast fluctuations in value, being used in criminality and frequent theft through hacks.

Last year, Japan’s Coincheck was hacked and more than $500m-worth of digital currency stolen. In 2017 the South Korean exchange Youbit shut down and filed for bankruptcy after being hacked twice. The Tokyo-based MtGox exchange, which at one time handled almost 80% of all global bitcoin transactions, was shut down in 2014 after 850,000 bitcoins (worth half a billion US dollars at the time) disappeared from its virtual vaults.

The Financial Conduct Authority has proposed a ban on financial instruments linked to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, warning that such products could cause huge losses for retail consumers unlikely to understand their risks or value.

Remixpoint said it would compensate customers for the losses. About ¥2.5bn-worth of the missing currency was customer funds, with the rest owned by the firm. Shares in Remixpoint plunged almost 20% after the announcement.

Japan has been relatively open to cryptocurrencies, which use a technology called blockchain, despite the high-profile heists. It has set up a licensing system to oversee their use.

Bitcoin has been a legal form of payment in Japan since April 2017.",2019-07-12,https://www.coindesk.com/the-miami-dolphins-now-have-an-official-crypto-and-its-litecoin,"American football team the Miami Dolphins have teamed up with the Litecoin Foundation to accept cryptocurrency payments.

Announced by the Litecoin Foundation on Thursday, the partnership will kick off on Sept. 5 – the start of the 2019 NFL season – and sees the Dolphins accept litecoin as their “official cryptocurrency.”

In effect, that means that fans at home games at the Hard Rock Stadium will be able to pay with litecoin and bitcoin when buying tickets for the Dolphin’s 50/50 raffle, which gives half of proceeds to the Miami Dolphins Foundation and its charitable causes.

The crypto payments will be made possible by a third partner in the deal, Aliant Payments.

Charlie Lee, litecoin creator and managing director of the Litecoin Foundation, said:

“This collaboration propels Litecoin in front of an audience of millions of people around the world at a time where adoption of cryptocurrencies continues to gain momentum and the ecosystem is able to support real world use cases in ways previously not possible. We see this as a powerful way to raise awareness and educate people about Litecoin and cryptocurrencies on a tremendous scale.”



While perhaps a minor role in the popular pro football team’s money-making machine, the move marks the Litecoin Foundation’s latest effort to raise awareness about its cryptocurrency and the technology in general.

Last December, the foundation also partnered with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), one of the leading mixed martial arts organizations, in a deal to display the litecoin logo on the canvas of the fight octagon at an event involving a former UFC light heavyweight champion.

At press time, the price of litecoin is $105, up 3.4 percent over 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.",2019-07-12 09:12:54+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/irs-confirms-it-trained-staff-on-finding-crypto-wallets,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may consider subpoenaing major tech companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft in search of taxpayers’ unreported cryptocurrency holdings.

That’s according to a slide deck presentation from an IRS cyber training session, which details a number of ways the agency’s criminal investigators might find potential crypto tax cheats.

“Issuance of a Grand Jury Subpoena should be considered for Apple, Google, and Microsoft for the Subject’s complete application download history,” says the slide deck prepared by James Daniels, the program manager for cyber crimes at the IRS’ criminal investigation unit.

“Each application’s function should be explored to determine whether or not the application can transmit, or otherwise allow, transactions in bitcoin,” Daniels wrote. If so, it should be checked whether the app allows only peer-to-peer transactions, or also transactions with crypto-related businesses.

The deck was leaked on Twitter this week by a certified public accountant (CPA) named Laura Walter. The IRS confirmed to CoinDesk that the slides were genuine.

Justin Cole, director of communication and education at IRS’ criminal investigation unit, said the materials were presented to agency staff at an event at the World Bank in Washington, D.C., on June 5-7.

“The training material has been used around the world to various law enforcement partner audiences and was again given at this forum in a room that included partners from dozens of countries around the world as well as various press members,” Cole wrote in an email.

He would not say whether the IRS will definitely implement the suggested measures. “I can’t discuss specific investigative actions that the agency may or may not take in the future,” Cole said.

Searching social media

Daniels’ presentation also suggested that the IRS request information from “those who know the financial habits of the Subject, including, but not limited to, bank tellers, family and friends of the Subject (if feasible), and establishments the Subject frequents that may accept bitcoins.”

Social media accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, also should be searched for public mentions of crypto-related information, as well as vendors that accept bitcoin, the deck says.

“A Grand Jury Subpoena should also be considered for (and may already have been obtained during the normal course of the investigation) the Subject’s financial accounts, including, but not limited to, the Subject’s bank, credit card, and PayPal records,” the document goes on, for the further analysis of transactions.

If it becomes clear that the subject of an investigation owns bitcoin, all wallet addresses and balances should be identified, Daniels wrote.

If they use an exchange or online wallet service these companies can be subpoenaed for the user’s balance, addresses, and “any identifying information,” including “any linked financial accounts, login times and information, correspondence, and transaction details,” the slide deck says.

However, the reliability of this approach “has yet to be extensively tested,” Daniels acknowledged. “As such, it may not be advised to send a Subpoena for records if not critically necessary.”

The taxpayers under investigation themselves shouldn’t be sent subpoenas, as this “may be detrimental to the seizure of any bitcoin balance.”

The IRS’s subpoena power applies in civil cases as well as criminal ones, noted Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson. “While this presentation was given by the criminal investigation unit and clearly indicates that criminal investigation will use that tool, there is nothing preventing the civil side from using it as well,” she said.

However, Zarlenga pointed out, the IRS is required to notify taxpayers before it subpoenas third parties, so people will likely know if the tax agency is looking for their bitcoin.

The IRS is getting ready to issue new guidance on reporting crypto for tax purposes, the first to come out since an initial notice published in 2014. A number of questions on how exactly crypto should be taxed have come up since then, often with multiple possible ways to tackle them.

The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission has approved four new crypto business operators to legally operate in the country. In addition to licensing a new crypto exchange, the government has officially approved the country’s first three digital token portals. Meanwhile, new rules, conditions, and procedures have been introduced for digital asset businesses.

Digital Asset Business Operators

Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially approved four new digital asset business operators. Under the country’s current regulatory framework for digital assets, which covers both cryptocurrency and digital tokens, a company can apply for a license to operate an exchange, a broker, or a dealer for cryptocurrency, digital tokens, or both. Separate licenses are required for cryptocurrency and digital tokens.

Among the four new digital asset business operators is Bitherb Co. Ltd. The company has received four licenses from the Thai SEC — one for providing a crypto exchange service, one for a digital token exchange service, one for a crypto brokerage service, and one for a digital token brokerage service. According to the commission’s website, the company has not begun operations.

Bitherb Co. Ltd. is a subsidiary of Japanese public company Remixpoint, which operates a regulated Japanese crypto exchange, Bitpoint Japan. It is co-founded by Asia Herb Association Bangkok Co. Ltd. Remixpoint revealed in February that it had obtained four licenses from the Thai SEC but the subsidiary had not been added to the SEC’s list of approved digital asset business operators at the time since its system still needed to be inspected and validated by the regulator. A representative of Bitpoint Japan told news.Bitcoin.com at the time that Bitherb “will begin to operate after [the] SEC inspects the company within 180 days after license acquisition (by July 30th, 2019).” Bitherb is now listed on the SEC website as an approved digital asset business operator.

Including Bitherb, Thailand now has four digital asset exchanges, all of which have been approved for both cryptocurrency and digital tokens. Three of them — Bitkub Online Co. Ltd. (Bitkub), Bitcoin Co. Ltd. (BX), and Satang Corporation (Satang Pro) — were approved in January. Another digital asset operator that has been approved by the Thai SEC is Coins TH. This company was approved in January to operate as a broker and a dealer for cryptocurrency.

First 3 Licensed ICO Portals Unveiled

Local media reported in March that the Thai SEC had approved the country’s first portal for initial coin offerings (ICOs). However, the commission neither made an official announcement about the approval nor disclosed the name of the portal it supposedly approved until now.

The country’s first three SEC-approved ICO portals have now been added to the commission’s website. They are Longroot (Thailand) Co. Ltd. (Longroot), T-box (Thailand) Co. Ltd. (T-box), and SE Digital Co. Ltd. (SE Digital). According to the regulator, none of them have started operations. Further, the latter two companies still need to have their systems inspected and validated by the SEC before they can begin operations.

ICO portals are an integral part of Thailand’s regulatory framework for digital tokens. To sell tokens to the public, the seller must obtain approval from the SEC and the tokens must be sold through an SEC-approved ICO portal. Thailand now has three ICO portals, but no ICO issuer has been approved so far.

In addition, the Thai SEC maintains two lists of “website, tokens, and coins the SEC has advised the public to be careful with any investment solicitations of such entities,” the commission detailed. The first list is for “digital tokens which have not applied or granted approval for offerings.” It comprises 21 names including Onecoin by OFC coin​, ​​DB token, ICO by Adventure Hostel Bangkok​, and ​Muay Thai coin. The other list is for “persons and websites relating to digital assets which have not been licensed.” There are currently 18 entries on the list, including ​Q Exchange​, a joint venture between Thai and South Korean companies.

Follow-Up Crypto Regulation

The Thai government’s Fiscal Policy Office has published the SEC’s follow-up regulation entitled “Rules, Conditions, and Procedures for Digital Asset Businesses.” It will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.

Among the rules set forth in this document is the capital requirements for digital asset businesses. For example, operators holding customer assets must generally maintain daily liquid capital of at least 15 million baht [~$485,572] and at least 5% of the customer’s asset value. The percentage requirement is lower if some of the assets are kept in cold storage. Digital asset exchanges that do not hold customer assets must maintain capital of at least 5 million baht.

Thailand enacted two royal decrees to regulate crypto assets on May 14 last year — the Royal Decree on the Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 and the Royal Decree of the Amendment to the Revenue Code. The latter imposes levies on income derived from cryptocurrency and digital tokens. Prior to any token offerings, the issuers must obtain approval from the SEC and “the registration statement and draft prospectus shall be filed with the SEC office,” the government explained.

In March, the Thai SEC announced that four cryptocurrencies had been approved: BTC, ETH, XRP, and XLM. They can be legally used for investments in ICOs and as base trading pairs against other cryptocurrencies. This list replaces the previous one announced in June last year. However, approval does not make these coins legal tender, the regulator clarified.

Sunisa Thamphiban, Assistant Director of the Legal and Development Department at the Thai SEC, emphasized at a public seminar on July 11 that “the Digital Asset Act” aims to “supervise the middleman that will act as an intermediary in the exchange of digital assets.” She elaborated that they must comply with all of the requirements set by the SEC and the Office of the Anti-Money Laundering Committee in order to “prevent the use of digital assets for money laundering.”

Some two-thirds of the losses went to exchange customers, while the rest is shouldered by the exchange’s management company, Remixpoint.

No one knows, yet, how the massive hack went down, and an investigation is underway.

It’s not the first Japan-targeted crypto heist, either. Nor is it the biggest.

In January 2018, a record $534 million of NEM was stolen from the Japan’s Coincheck exchange, from a low-security hot wallet connected to the internet.

Four years earlier, Tokyo-based MtGox exchange was shut down after some half a billion dollars in bitcoin disappeared from its virtual vaults.

Elsewhere, in May this year, Binance saw a $40-million hack, as well, and the first half of this year has seen at least eight major crypto thefts.

In 2017, South Korea’s YouBit exchange was shut down and ended up filing for bankruptcy after a double hack.

In June this year, hackers stole over $4 million from Singapore’s Bitrue crypto exchange.

This latest hack comes amid a general pullback for Bitcoin prices, which suffered another $1,000 sell-off earlier this week but bounced back as of this morning, renewing bull optimism that it could regain recent highs above $13,000.

Another hack, of course, won’t help.

Nor will Trump tweets--though so far they haven’t dented crypto.

On Thursday, Trump decided to chime in on Bitcoin--an area he has traditionally avoided--attacking it and branding the digital currency world at large “unregulated crypto assets” that can “facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity”.

In other words, he’s not a fan.

In one tweet, Trump noted that crypto currencies “are not money” and their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air”.

In another, he attacked Facebook’s Libra, which he declared “will have little standing or dependability”.

“If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter …”

The final Trump verdict was this:

“We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant urrency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!”

Bitcoin, as of this morning, doesn’t seem to be responding dramatically to Trump’s Twitter barrage.

While the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, conceded that Trump’s a major psychological event for bitcoin after all this time, he also claimed it as a victory of sorts.

Japanese crypto exchanges are supposed to be beefing up security, but it’s clearly not working. Last year, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) refrained from issuing any new crypto licenses, and ordered everyone to take measures to improve security.

But for crypto at large--and particularly for Facebook’s Libra--which was the real target of Trump’s tweets, it could be a harbinger of new regulations to come.

Trump isn’t the only one who’s gone after Libra this week. Even Fed chair Jerome Powell is on the same page as Trump with this one. He warned this week that existing rules do not suit digital currencies.

“Libra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, and financial stability,” he said, damning Libra to purgatory until these questions are addressed.

On July 12, South African payment gateway service Payfast announced the company is dropping bitcoin core (BTC) payments due to network congestion and high fees. Payfast emphasized that BTC has a number of limitations and design flaws which makes it an “impractical substitute for cash.”

Network Congestion and High Transaction Fees Force Payfast to Drop BTC Support

According to a blog post written by Payfast, one of South Africa’s largest online payment gateways, BTC payments will no longer be processed after July 20, 2019. Payfast is a popular service provider with more than 80,000 registered merchants and was founded in 2007 by Jonathan Smit and Andy Higgins. The company blogpost details that unfortunately the company has found numerous limitations and “design flaws unique to Bitcoin that make it an impractical substitute for cash.” This includes high transaction fees and long confirmation times for Payfast customers. The company explained that it had tried various ways to mitigate the issues at hand, but had found that the underlying problem stems from the root of BTC’s fundamentals.

“The resultant poor user experience has led us to re-evaluate bitcoin as a payment method on our platform and a decision has been taken to discontinue support for bitcoin from midnight 20 July 2019,” Payfast wrote. The company further said that BTC once held the promise of a “global currency that would allow a faster, cheaper, and easier way to move money on the Internet,” but this never came to fruition. “Our aim was to enable that promise for our buyers and merchants, and to support this alternative to traditional payment methods,” Payfast highlighted. The South African company had partnered with the local cryptocurrency exchange Luno to provide an intermediary between a buyer’s BTC wallet and the Payfast service.

@PayFast Bitcoin Cash is the same version of Bitcoin that used to be fast, cheap and reliable. Bitpay supports it. — ₿ Mike (@libertarianbit) July 12, 2019

Payfast remarked that buyers always paid the BTC amount, while sellers would receive a rand payment to their accounts. Luno also “locked the Bitcoin to ZAR exchange rate for a 10 minute window,” similarly to many cryptocurrency invoice solutions. For instance, the Atlanta-based Bitpay’s invoices last 14 minutes. However, if the person’s BTC transaction did not confirm within Luno’s invoice window, the payment was unsuccessful and a refund would be due. The Payfast blog post noted:

As Bitcoin has grown in popularity, it has become increasingly difficult for the network to sufficiently confirm transactions within the 10 minute time limit. Since the network isn’t able to handle the volume of instructions at the speed required, the majority of Bitcoin transactions on the Payfast platform ended up being unsuccessful.

A Tragic Trend of Lost Businesses Making HODL the Only Option

As the news spread across social media, some people said they had expected the announcement, while others were surprised and even a bit salty toward Payfast. Bitcoin ABC developer Amaury Séchet (Deadalnix) said on Twitter that “the tragedy continues — One more payment processor dropping bitcoin.” “Payfast, you might want to consider switching to bitcoin cash instead. You are experiencing exactly why the fork happened,” Séchet added.

However, well known member of the Monero (XMR) community Riccardo Spagni‏ said the blog post was a “Garbage article from Payfast on why they’re removing bitcoin support — Sounds like they have no clue how Bitcoin works.” One person replied to Spagni’s criticism and said that it was not polite to blame and name call Payfast engineers. “If the tech does not meet their needs, they can move to better solutions,” he explained. Payfast’s blog post further sparked a number of BCH supporters to vocalize that there was a solution available right now for Payfast and that the company should try bitcoin cash instead.

“I have made zero payments with BTC in the past 3 years, but dozens with BCH with no issues and paying pennies in fees,” a BCH supporter chimed in after Payfast made the announcement. “If you add BCH you will have my business.”

This isn’t the first time bitcoin core (BTC) payments have been plagued with complaints about high fees and transaction congestion. There have been many well known companies that have dropped BTC support for these very reasons. Back in the summer of 2018 the brothers Patrick and John Collison, the cofounders of Stripe, explained why the company decided to drop BTC.

The Collison brothers questioned the BTC community and told them they faced a fork in the road where architects of the software chose to optimize BTC to be a form of “digital gold or a store of value.” “At the time we made our decision, it was trending towards being a digital store of value,” Patrick told the press. He wished the BTC crowd the best going forward and insisted that “if it starts increasing [in use] again as a payment method, then sure, great, we’ll go back and we’ll add [BTC].”

Many other companies have dropped BTC support over the years almost immediately after BTC transaction fees started to spike infeasibly and became unpredictable. Businesses such as Expedia, Dell Computers, Steam Games, Reddit, Fiverr, and Paypal stopped supporting BTC. Moreover, many startups that were once looking to use BTC in applications also ditched the cryptocurrency network for alternative blockchains with cheaper transaction fees. Payfast eliminating BTC was also big news on Reddit forums and many crypto supporters sarcastically called the company’s move a “big win for BTC maximalists.” One Reddit user chortled:

Thank god all these wasteful use cases are being eliminated so that HODL is the only option for people which will ensure that moon lambos are handed out to all the Bitcoin Maxis by next halvening.

What kind of stocks stir up controversy like no other? Penny stocks. These tickers trading for less than $5 per share have earned a reputation as some of the most divisive names on Wall Street, with these plays either met with open arms or given the cold shoulder.It’s understandable why some investors are wary. Those opposed are quick to point out that there could be a very real reason these stocks are changing hands for pocket change, with the low share prices often masking obstacles like weak fundamentals or troubling headwinds. That said, others are drawn in by the sheer growth potential of penny stocks. The fact is that even minor share price appreciation can mean huge percentage gains, and thus, serious returns. What’s more, your money goes further with these bargain names.No matter which side you take, one thing is certain, due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions. That’s where the experts come in, namely the analysts at Roth Capital. These pros bring experience and in-depth knowledge to the table.With this in mind, our focus turned to two penny stocks that have received a thumbs up from Roth Capital analysts. Running the tickers through TipRanks’ database, both have been cheered by the rest of the Street as well, as they boast a “Strong Buy” analyst consensus. Not to mention substantial upside potential is on the table.Cellectar Biosciences (CLRB)Leveraging its patented phospholipid drug conjugates (PDCs) delivery platform, Cellectar Biosciences develops cutting-edge treatments for cancer. Based on the potential of its drug candidate, CLR 131, and its $1.24 share price, Roth Capital thinks that now is the time to get in on the action.Representing the firm, analyst Jonathan Aschoff tells clients that he is optimistic about CLR 131, which is a small-molecule, targeted PDC designed to deliver cytotoxic radiation directly and selectively to cancer cells, in the lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM) indications. According to Aschoff, following its Type B guidance meeting with the FDA, “CLRB is prepared to initiate its first pivotal CLR 131 trial in LPL/WM after achieving a 100% ORR and 75% major response rate in four patients.” He points out that although CLRB just reported promising results in multiple myeloma (MM) (40% ORR in triple class refractory (TCR) patients at total body doses of at least 60mCi), LPL/WM was selected for the initial pivotal trial based on the very strong initial results and the lower competition for patients.“We view this as a prudent decision because NCCN compedia listing in MM is a mere peer-reviewed publication away, if first approved in LPL/WM. We also note that CLRB has steadily improved its dosing of CLR 131, essentially fractionating the doses so that higher total body doses are well tolerated,” Aschoff further explained. Adding to the good news, the therapy generated activity in preliminary Phase 1 unresectable brain tumors. Aschoff added, “Disease control was shown in two heavily pretreated patients with ependymomas, showing the drug's ability to cross the blood brain barrier, and all doses through 60 mCi/m2 have exhibited a favorable safety profile.”To this end, Aschoff rates CLRB a Buy along with a $10 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 713%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Aschoff’s track record, click here)Are other analysts in agreement? They are. 5 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. So, the message is clear: CLRB is a Strong Buy. Given the $5.48 average price target, shares could soar 345% from current levels. (See CLRB stock analysis on TipRanks)Applied Genetic Technologies (AGTC)With vast gene therapy experience, Applied Genetic Technologies designs and constructs all critical gene therapy elements and brings them together to develop successful treatments for patients. Currently going for $4.50 apiece, Roth Capital believes this stock’s long-term growth narrative is strong.Firm analyst Zegbeh Jallah points out that recently released data for its XLRP gene therapy program, which is expected to enter pivotal studies in Q1 2021, reaffirmed his bullish thesis. “Despite the market not fully appreciating the data given how the stock traded, we continue to believe that the results suggest that AGTC could have a best-in-class therapy, which is supportive of the planned pivotal efforts,” he explained.Providing an update on the results of the Phase 1/2 XLRP study, using the FDA's criteria, AGTC evaluated responses at 12 months in the lower dose groups (2 and 4), and 6 months in the higher dose groups (5 and 6). According to Jallah, “initial responses were observed in dose Groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, with impressive response durability even at 12 months.”On top of this, at 6 months, the dose used in Group 5 resulted in a 43% response rate or a 57% response rate if excluding a patient not meeting the enrollment criteria. In Group 6, a response rate of 50% was observed, or 100% excluding patients not meeting the enrollment criteria.Jallah added, “All measurements were obtained in the 36 perimetry grid, which we believe should make it easier to preselect loci likely to respond. Although BCVA is not the primary endpoint, BCVA improvements, which can capture changes in the central region, were maintained at 12 months.”Even though some investors have expressed concern about Meira’s competing therapy, Jallah believes AGTC’s technology could have a leg up. “Overall, we believe that the data from both companies is strongly indicative of the efficacy potential of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease, and although differences in the study design makes direct comparisons difficult, we believe that AGTC could have a competitive advantage heading into pivotal studies,” he commented.In line with his optimistic approach, Jallah reiterated a Buy rating and $30 price target, indicating 568% upside potential. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here)All in all, other analysts echo Jallah’s sentiment. 5 Buys and zero Holds or Sells add up to a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $18.25 is less aggressive than Jallah’s but still leaves room for upside potential of 306%.

Plasma is a scaling solution that can be used with various blockchains. It is commonly associated with Ethereum, but Plasma is compatible with other platforms as well. Essentially, it can help a blockchain perform computations more efficiently.

Ethereum, for example, can currently only handle about 15 transactions per second. This is a barrier to mass adoption, and to compete with credit cards and payment processors, blockchains need off-chain scaling solutions. This is where Plasma comes in.

Plasma was proposed in a joint paper by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and Lightning Network creator Joseph Poon. Since then, it has taken on a life of its own, and there are now dozens of different Plasma variants in existence.

Although the details of each Plasma variant differ, every type has the same basic purpose: to offload a blockchain’s transactions and take them on itself. To understand why there are so many variants, let’s take a look at the basics of Plasma.

The Basics of Plasma

Plasma MVP, or Minimally Viable Plasma, was the first variant of Plasma to ever exist. Plasma MVP essentially relies on an operator who accepts transactions and waits for a block to fill before committing those transactions to Ethereum.

This means that Ethereum nodes don’t need to verify each transaction that takes place on Plasma. However, Plasma MVP does a few things its own way: instead of using Ethereum’s account balance model, Plasma relies on unspent transaction outputs (or UTXOs).

The UTXO model relies heavily on the order that transactions take place in (and the values of those transactions). The end result is that Plasma MVP can perform transactions quite quickly. However, the UTXO model introduces a few complications, and other Plasma variants have tried to solve them.

Support For Special Tokens

Plasma MVP can perform basic cryptocurrency transactions quite quickly, but it can’t handle other types of tokens. That’s where Plasma Cash comes in. Plasma Cash is designed to handle non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—that is, tokens that are individually unique and not coin-like.

Plasma Cash’s support for NFT tokens makes it an ideal way to handle collectibles, game assets, securities, and other non-divisible assets. Plasma Cash can also handle regular ETH transfers, but it stores them in NFTs, and it only supports fixed amounts of ETH.

So, contrary to what the name implies, Plasma Cash isn’t really ideal for everyday payments and spending. This, in turn, calls for another variant of Plasma: Plasma Debit, which acts a little like a Lightning hub so that it can handle regular cryptocurrency.

Plasma Debit introduces transferable payment channels, and it also allows for fractional spending. It is very versatile, as it supports both regular cryptocurrency and NFTs. However, it is fairly complicated and it has some usability issues as well.

Speeding Up Withdrawals

Plasma MVP, Cash, and Debit are all major variants of Plasma. Unfortunately, they all share one big problem: they all have a very slow withdrawal process. Even though Plasma performs transactions quickly, withdrawals take much longer.

It usually takes one to two weeks to withdraw funds from Plasma. This is good for security: a “challenge period” allows Plasma users to keep Plasma operators in check. Still, this isn’t convenient for anyone who needs to take their funds out of Plasma quickly.

Other variations have been proposed in order to solve this problem. Simple Fast Withdrawals, for example, uses debt tokenization and liquidity markets, ensuring that tokens can be cashed out quickly.

Solving Mass Exits

Plasma can also become congested if a lot of users try to “exit” and withdraw their funds at once. This problem has little to do with normal withdrawal speeds. Instead, it is all about increasing the number of exits that Plasma can safely handle.

At least two proposed variants aim to solve this problem in a direct way: Basic Mass Exits (for Plasma MVP) and Optimistic Cheap Multi-Exits (for Plasma Cash and MVP).

These variants don’t actually make withdrawals faster, nor do they remove the challenge period. They simply ensure that mass exits cannot risk the security of the Plasma chain or cause the chain to grind to a halt.

Making Plasma Programmable

Developers can incorporate any Plasma variant into a blockchain app. For example, the Loom Network is fully integrated with Plasma Cash, and it provides a powerful set of tools for blockchain app developers.

However, most Plasma variants do not offer built-in programming capabilities. The main issue is that Plasma’s UTXO model is not well suited for smart contracts, nor is it compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

That said, there are a few Plasma variants that attempt to introduce programming and computational features. Plasma Leap retains the UTXO model, for example – though it only supports “spending conditions” rather than traditional smart contracts.

Meanwhile, Plasmabits and Plasma EVM have tried to deliver greater compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts. These two variants abandon UTXO and return to an account model. None of these three variants are very high-profile, though.

Why Are There So Many Variants?

Each flavor of Plasma exists to solve a unique problem. However, that only goes part of the way toward explaining why there are dozens of variants. The truth is less impressive: many Plasma variants are simply not making much progress.

In fact, a number of proposals are entirely unfeasible. The Plasma ecosystem as a whole is fairly young, so developers are still helping it find its direction. Much like the number of improbable altcoin projects, not all of them are expected to survive.

It should also be noted that Plasma is not a single project. It is a framework that can be adapted for different purposes by different people. There are a few core features, but the Plasma framework is very malleable.

This is a somewhat disjointed approach, but it hasn’t stopped Plasma from attracting attention. OmiseGo and the Loom Network have both adopted variants of Plasma, and as time goes on, many flavors of Plasma may find success elsewhere.",2019-07-13 17:16:48+00:00,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/07/149439-bitcoin-norway-shuts-down-due-to-theft-via-sim-swap-hack-and-sophisticated-spear-phishing-techniques/,"Bitcoin Norway has shut down all operations according to its website and posts on Facebook.

The media continues to address us with speculation linked to sikkerhetssvikten at Alpha point. We don’t want to contribute to the kind of speculation, but relate to the information we’ve received from alpha point.

Nordic publication E24 has been following the story claiming that potentially millions in Bitcoin have been stolen and impacted investors have hired lawyers to represent their interests. E24 reported:

“On Monday last week, the customers of Bitcoins Norway’s crypto exchange were told that their crypto currency would be forcibly sold at a significantly lower price due to an alleged attack on the supplier Alphapoint.” [translated]

An earlier report in E24 claimed the issue was “due to a security hole at the supplier AlphaPoint technology, and that these are hit by a hacker attack.” [translated]

Crowdfund Insider contacted AlphaPoint for more information on the reports.

AlphaPoint has emerged as a highly respected operation that has been providing crypto trading and issuance infrastructure for multiple years.

AlphaPoint CEO Igor Telyatnikov shared the following statement explaining the hack:

AlphaPoint reported to Bitcoins Norway on May 1, 2019 that a security incident had occurred. Bitcoins Norway’s original post reported the date as May 7, 2019.

There are a number of other clarifications and corrections to the Bitcoins Norway report. There was no hack of the AlphaPoint software or technology. Rather, attackers gained access through a SIM swap enabled by exploiting a vulnerability in a telecom carrier, and sophisticated spear-phishing techniques which compromised sensitive credentials.

The FBI is the sole and appropriate law enforcement entity to investigate this crime. AlphaPoint is fully cooperating with the investigation. AlphaPoint immediately notified Bitcoins Norway of the security incident, and provided as much information as it could without jeopardizing the investigation and without risking the spread of inaccurate information.

On July 1, 2019, Bitcoins Norway made the decision to announce that it would sell end users cryptocurrency. AlphaPoint did not participate in that decision.

AlphaPoint assured Bitcoins Norway that AlphaPoint would compensate Bitcoins Norway, which we are doing. We stand by our customers.

SIM Swap hacks are a pressing issue in the crypto sector but this scam also impacts other types of theft and data privacy in general. Having been the victim of a SIM Swap hack, I speak from experience. It is no fun. While all or most of these types of scams could be addressed by basic actions from the mobile wireless providers – these companies have yet to act.

Bitpoint suspended all services following the hack, while the exchange's parent firm Remixpoint Inc. shed 19% following the theft. Remixpoint went untraded in Tokyo following the attack due to a reported glut of sell orders.

The recent incident involving Bitpoint follows a record-breaking hack of Japanese exchange Coincheck in January 2018, wherein $534 million of NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck’s low-security hot wallet.

Bitpoint was one of several exchanges to receive a business improvement order from Japan’s finance watchdog, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), in June of last year. One of the FSA’s main concerns was the exchanges’ compliance with Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer requirements.

The agency also expressed concerns that customer funds were not being kept sufficiently separate from those of the exchanges.",,https://www.coindesk.com/what-trumps-bitcoin-tweet-changes,"Let’s be clear: It was not the substance of Donald Trump’s tweet that made his critique of bitcoin and Libra so important last week.

It should be of no surprise that this US President would declare himself “not a fan” of “highly volatile” cryptocurrencies “based on thin air” that “facilitate unlawful behavior” or that he much prefers a “dependable and reliable” currency “called the United States Dollar!”

(Anyone who assumed Trump would be a “drain-the-swamp” libertarian advocate for censorship-resistant money had an ill-informed view of a man whose government is stacked with former Wall Street execs, who opposes free trade and immigration, and takes a draconian approach to a variety of civil rights and social liberties.)

What matters is the very fact that a sitting president mentioned cryptocurrencies at all. Indeed, from a price perspective, Trump’s disparaging remarks are, on balance, positive for bitcoin. By Friday evening, the post-tweet price action reflected that.

More importantly, the tweet marks a symbolic milestone in the gradual but ever-expanding presence that cryptocurrency occupies in the public conversation around money and policy.

It also marks the starting point in a titanic battle over the shape of our global money system.

Publicity you can’t buy

Why is a Trump tweet-shame positive for bitcoin’s price? Well, bitcoin must stay relevant to succeed, and this was, at the very least, an acknowledgement from the halls of power of its relevance.

By simply giving it the time of day, Trump revealed that people within the high levels of the U.S. power structure are noticing the challenge that cryptocurrency technology poses to it.

Also important: the tweet came shortly after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, one of the U.S. President’s favorite punching bags, had described bitcoin, in Senate testimony, not as a payments vehicle but as “an alternative to gold…a store of value…a speculative store of value.”

Powell wasn’t saying that he saw bitcoin as gold-like per se; it was a reference to how most bitcoin’s users currently treat it and, in that sense, he was simply stating a fact. Still, it gave some legitimacy to bitcoin’s claim to be the digital-era replacement of that ancient store of value.

And if we think of how gold has been used during the fiat currency era – as protection against the political risks inherent in national currencies – then this one-two punch could hardly be better for those arguing that bitcoin should play that role in the 21st century.

Think about it: they got the most powerful central banker in the world to describe bitcoin in such terms. Soon after, a self-interested politician who occupies the world’s most powerful government post demonstrated why you might want such protection.

Amplifying the Narrative

All of this comes within the context of the announcement last month of the Facebook-sponsored blockchain and cryptocurrency project, Libra.

As was inevitable when a powerful and contentious company launches a radical new idea, Libra’s arrival has massively amplified what I like to call the “narrative economy” in which cryptocurrencies thrive.

With its potential global clout drawing on Facebook’s 2.7 billion user base, Libra is forcing people – corporate leaders, bankers and, most importantly, government leaders – to think and talk about cryptocurrencies. It’s what prompted the question to Powell from Mike Crapo, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and it was the main focus of the Fed Chairman’s reply. And it’s clearly what inspired Trump to take to Twitter, given that his three-tweet post included a line saying that Libra “will have little standing or dependability” and would need to seek a banking charter if it is to operate.

Let’s not forget, either, that this comes right before next week’s hearings on Libra called by House Financial Services Committee, called by its Chair, Maxine Waters, who has warned that Facebook’s project cannot be allowed to compete with the dollar.

That there’s alignment between Trump and Waters on an issue is itself historic. But it also hints at the power battle at play. The mounting conversation is about the structure of our financial system and about the dominance of the intermediaries that manage that system: banks, deeply integrated as they are into our system of government, money and power.

As gatekeepers of the dominant fiat currency system, banks – and, by extension, the political leaders who determine how to regulate them – can make it harder for people to use both decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and corporate-backed private currencies such as Libra. Trump’s tweet, with a high degree of specificity, looked suspiciously as if it had been drafted by someone with interests in the banking sector.

But putting a lid on all this won’t be easy for governments. Most cryptocurrencies, whether bitcoin or Libra, are based on open-source software. Can those governments ban the software? Technically yes, but how will they globally coordinate around that effort, how would they stop it?

As it is, many central banks suddenly seem to be adopting the “if you can’t beat them, join them” strategy. The government-owned China Daily reported this week that China was accelerating its plans to produce a digital currency. That came a week after Agustin Carstens, chief of the Bank of International Settlements, said central banks would introduce digital currencies “sooner than we think.” It was a remarkable about-face from someone who had months earlier told cryptocurrency coders to “stop trying to create money,” and dismissed any value in central bank digital currencies.

Probably more important, right around the time of the Libra announcement last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney dropped a bombshell, saying that the BOE would provide funds to tech companies, an apparent move to spearhead fintech development in London at a time when Brexit has threatened the banking industry. The opening poses a huge opportunity for Libra and other stablecoins to provide new “narrow banking” payment services.

Things are poised to get mighty confusing, in other words, with private corporate currencies, decentralized cryptocurrencies and government-run digital currencies all competing for primacy in the world of money. Thank to Libra – but really, thanks to bitcoin before it – the narrative economy around monetary innovation is getting seriously amplified.

Communities of stories

As the noise level rises, more and more people will inquire and explore alternatives to mainstream currencies such as bitcoin. They’ll also grapple with the opportunities, risks and the disruptive challenges such a choice poses.

Essentially, a giant, collective storytelling exercise has been pushed into overdrive. Stories have always driven the adoption of new ideas, building the connective emotional tissue upon which social networks and communities are formed around them. And that, in turn – the development of a community around a shared idea – is ultimately what underpins a currency.

Trump, who with his 62 million Twitter followers arguably has a broadcasting power greater than any news network, is contributing to this collective storytelling exercise. Perhaps he’s the foil character, standing in opposition to the HODLers and “To the Moon” crypto enthusiasts, but even in that role he is driving the narrative – essentially by fueling resistance, by encouraging his opponents to counter with counte-rarguments and, of course, memes.

Which brings us to the other factor ensuring that Trump’s tweet, more than any other statement by a government official, will prove to be instrumental in driving buzz and bluster around this topic: Twitter itself.

Twitter is not only the President’s favorite vehicle for communicating with the public, it also represents the most important segment of crypto’s narrative economy. If ever there were a community prepared to respond to those three short posts, it was Crypto Twitter, which immediately responded with its special mix of snark, humor and passion.

God knows where all this goes. But one thing’s for certain: the cryptocurrency carnival just got wilder.

Per the release, the startup has integrated its XPOS crypto payments module on the X990 Android-based POS terminal by VeriFone, which is reportedly one of the world’s major producers of such devices. The initiative aims to allow a wider network of retailers to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. The startup states:

“With this integration, shops and retail outlets using the VeriFone X990 with XPOS module activated will now be able to process cryptocurrency payments alongside traditional transactions.”

The XPOS-enabled devices will support payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), KuCoin Shares (KCS), Kyber Network (KNC), Nem (XEM) and Pundi X (NPXS). The device will automatically exchange between fiat and cryptocurrencies during the transactions, which can be made with Pundi XPASS cards or the XWallet app.

According to the press release, VeriFone has over 35 million devices in more than 150 countries. Crunchbase estimates the firm’s revenue to be $1.8 billion annually.

In June last year, Pundi X began rolling out its cryptocurrency POS devices in Indonesia, betting that the central bank would discard its anti-cryptocurrency stance within three years.

As the crypto community is bidding farewell to the regulator’s outgoing head, J. Christopher Giancarlo, his successor’s stance on digital assets remains unknown. Turning to Tarbert’s record as a civil servant and attorney in the financial markets field could shed some light on the direction that the agency might take under his leadership.

Giancarlo’s five-year tenure saw the rise of cryptocurrency derivatives as an object of regulatory oversight. Widely regarded as the crypto industry’s ally, “Crypto Dad” superintended the historic launch of regulated Bitcoin futures and advocated for a “do no harm” approach to blockchain regulation in his testimony before the U.S. Congress. At the same time, as some observers have pointed out, Giancarlo has stepped up enforcement efforts, turning the CFTC into an agency with teeth.

The news of President Donald Trump nominating Tarbert, a senior official in the Treasury Department, to serve as the new head of the CFTC emerged in December 2018. On June 5, 2019, the Senate voted to confirm his appointment by a wide margin, 84-9. Although Giancarlo’s tenure expired in April 2019, he agreed to stay until mid-July to oversee the agency’s transition to new leadership. In a statement, the outgoing chairman offered praise to his heritor, calling him highly qualified to continue transforming the agency “into a 21st Century regulator for today’s digital markets.”

Heath Tarbert: background and early career

A native of Baltimore, MD, Heath Tarbert received his bachelor’s degree in accounting and international business from Mount St. Mary, a Catholic liberal arts university located in his home state. He then spent four years in law school at the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania, consecutively earning his Juris Doctor and Doctor of Juridical Science. Tarbert then received the Thouron Award, a prestigious postgraduate scholarship that allowed him to pursue yet another advanced degree: a Ph.D. in comparative law from Oxford.

Having sealed this illustrious scholarly record, Tarbert began his industry career with a series of junior positions at law firms and clerkships in the judicial branch of the U.S. government. Between 2007 and 2008, he worked for the conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. This appointment likely played a significant role in Tarbert’s subsequent return to public service in the wake of Trump’s accession to the White House. According to one estimate, about 20% of Thomas office’s alumni have landed either political appointments or judicial nominations since early 2017, earning their former boss the informal status of “the Trump administration’s legal godfather.”

Upon concluding his clerkship with Justice Thomas, Heath Tarbert went on to serve as Associate Counsel to the President of the United States in the last months of the George W. Bush administration before leaving for the private sector early into Barack Obama’s first term, with a short stop as Special Counsel to the Senate Banking Committee. Tarbert worked for the international law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP and then Allen & Overy LLP, where he spearheaded the global financial regulatory practice.

Tarbert also served on the board of advisors for the the journal “Review of Securities and Commodities Regulation.” During his years in the private sector, he co-authored two articles that appeared in the journal “The Review of Banking & Financial Services.” Both are on the subject of the Volcker Rule, a regulation that restricts banks’ ability to use customers’ deposits to make certain kinds of speculative investments.

Comeback under Trump

In April 2017, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Tarbert to fill the position of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Markets and Development. In October, the nominee was sworn in. In 2017 and 2018, Tarbert served as acting U.S. executive director on the board of the World Bank Group, negotiating global institutional reforms. In April 2019, Tarbert was promoted to acting under secretary for international affairs.

Throughout his term with the Treasury, Tarbert represented the U.S. in several major international organizations in the area of financial markets regulation, such as the Financial Stability Board. He also led U.S. delegations at the G-7 and G-20 Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ Deputies meetings. As policy chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), Tarbert championed the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, a bill aimed at strengthening regulation of foreign investment in the U.S. so as to better protect national security.

The latter aspect of Tarbert’s Treasury career has been arguably the most publicly visible. As the CFIUS policy chair, he promoted the heightened review of foreign investments before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection, during which time he called for tighter standards for protecting the nation’s technological edge:

“Today, the acquisition of a Silicon Valley start-up may raise just as serious concerns from a national security perspective as the acquisition of a defense or aerospace company, CFIUS’s traditional area of focus.”

The bill enjoyed bipartisan support and was passed by the U.S. Congress in August 2018.

One practical manifestation of this turn toward curbing foreign powers’ attempts to get a hold of the U.S-sourced technology has been the Trump administration’s standoff with China. Tarbert was at the helm of this effort as well: It was him who announced in April 2018 that the government was considering invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to give Trump the power to limit Chinese investment in sensitive sectors of the U.S. economy.

Domestically, following his nomination as the CFTC chairman, Tarbert managed to muster support from across the industry that is perhaps the most dependent on the health of derivatives markets: the agricultural sector. In the buildup to the confirmation vote, many agricultural groups appeared as signatories on a letter to the U.S. Senate endorsing Tarbert for the regulator’s leadership. Particularly, the petition noted Tarbert’s willingness to walk the extra mile to learn the ins and outs of a brand new industry and its use of derivatives products.

Views on fintech

The new CFTC boss is inheriting a lot of work in progress: the impact of Brexit on international financial markets, another round in the fight for U.S. financial sovereignty in the face of the European Union seeking to impose new regulations on international swaps clearing houses and much more. The crypto derivatives agenda, which emerged as a major concern for the agency during Giancarlo’s term, is not going anywhere, either. Some matters — for example, Bakkt’s continued attempts to get regulatory clearance for its cryptocurrency futures platform — will require prompt decisions. What will these decisions look like? The evidence of where Heath Tarbert’s might stand on digital assets is piecemeal and scant.

Given his enormous experience with international financial regulation, there is no way Tarbert would not realize the importance of digital technologies to derivatives markets. However, every such attestation available is accompanied by the usual cautious acknowledgement of both “opportunities and risks.” In a statement before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry in March 2019, he said:

“We should acknowledge that our derivatives markets have recently been transformed by digital technologies that present opportunities as well as risks. The CFTC must remain committed to promulgating regulations that allow technological innovations to flourish, but also protect our markets and consumers from harm.”

In June, commenting on the new U.S-United Kingdom Financial Innovation Partnership, Tarbert observed that “technology is the future of financial services and innovation drives growth.”

Granted, these stock declarations are far from a ringing endorsement of fintech’s role in the area of the CFTC’s oversight. However, signs of formal acknowledgement are better than no signs at all. The takeaway from Tarbert’s history of fighting for U.S. national technological security is also rather ambiguous: His determination to assist domestic blockchain innovators could lead him to rid them of unnecessary regulatory hurdles, but at the same time, the cross-border nature of digital assets may trigger security concerns.

Some experts argue that the personal opinions of the CFTC chair might not be of immense importance to the crypto industry. Andrew Bull, a founding partner of BullBlockchainLaw, told Cointelegraph:

“Giancarlo is favorable towards the crypto industry, but this has not really impacted how the industry functions. In other words, the compliance requirements have not changed much as applied to crypto even though he was favorable to the industry. Anyways, the agency is not nearly as involved in the crypto industry as the SEC is, but has stated through guidance that crypto based derivatives without a doubt fall under the Act. Therefore, my conclusion is that not much will change, especially due to the lack of activity the CFTC actually has in the space.”

Regardless of personal factors, the CFTC holds great systemic importance for the blockchain sector’s development. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner at Nexo, attested:

“Any major move of the CFTC is a milestone in the financialization of the digital assets sector. [...] A firm but business-friendly regulatory framework paves the way for the institutional players in the crypto space and we already see this happening with Fidelity providing custodial services, traditional banking institutions such as Nomura, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are exploring offerings in the same direction. A regulated and above all liquid derivative market is a great signal with a permanent impact to retail and institutional investors that technology and cryptocurrencies built on blockchain are maturing into an asset class worth exploring.”

After all, the agency’s regulatory powers are vast. The CFTC has identified digital currencies as commodities in 2015, and now it has full jurisdiction over crypto derivatives and other financial products subject to the Commodity Exchange Act. These include futures, options and derivatives contracts, as well as any crypto-based trading platform that utilizes margins, leverages or financing.

Although the spot markets (in which commodities are traded in cash) underlying these instruments are outside of the commission’s purview, the CFTC has the authority to intervene if it believes fraud or manipulation are involved, which renders the scope very broad. The hope is that, as he takes the reins of the regulatory agency that is immensely important for the blockchain sector, Heath Tarbert would act so as to earn the honorable title of “Crypto Dad” as well, despite what President Trump may have to say.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-btc-link-xmr-okb-bnb,"The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Update, July 14: This article has been redacted to remove a featured coin.

The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has dipped below $300 billion from over $380 billion on June 26. This shows that the sharp recovery from the lows is taking a breather. While the unveiling of Facebook’s Libra project was a major boost to cryptocurrencies, the recent opposition to it from various quarters has led to profit booking.

While a number of altcoins have hit a rough patch and have given up the majority of their gains accrued over the past few weeks, Bitcoin is still looking strong. Hence, we view this fall as a buying opportunity. However, we do not suggest buying when the trend is down. Traders can wait for the price to stop falling and form a short-term bottom before initiating long positions.

The rally after the current corrective phase will clearly separate the winners from the losers. We suggest traders look to buy cryptocurrencies that have held above their strong supports and are quick to bounce back from the fall. Let’s see if we spot any trading opportunities in the top five performers of the past seven days.

BTC/USD

A number of big names spoke against Bitcoin (BTC) in the past week. The most important statement was from United States president Donald Trump who said that he was not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as he believed that it was not money, highly volatile and its value was “based on thin air.” However, the crypto community took this statement as a huge positive because it gave wide publicity to the asset class and showed that it has become so important that the U.S. president would comment on it.

The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that no one used Bitcoin for payments and it was only a “speculative store of value like gold.” The European Central Bank also voiced its opposition and said that Bitcoin was not a currency but a volatile asset, hence, it did not have any plans to add Bitcoin to its reserves.

On the other hand, Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of VC firm Social Capital, said that Bitcoin is the best hedge against the traditional financial system. Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust showed a considerable inflow of funds. This shows that while the central banks and world leaders continue to voice their opposition to Bitcoin, it is finding a place in the portfolio of large investors. So, should traders buy now or wait for lower levels? Let’s find out.

The recovery in the BTC/USD pair hit a barrier at $13,156.96 and turned down from there. It can now correct to the first support of $9,781.81, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. If this support holds, it will indicate that bulls are not willing to wait for lower levels to buy, which is a positive sign. The next rally is likely to retest $13,973.50.

On the other hand, if bears sink the price below $9,871.81, the next support is at the 50% retracement level of $8,604.80. The 20-week EMA is also close to it, hence, we expect a rebound from one of the supports.

As the RSI is still in overbought territory, the pair might not run up in a hurry. It might consolidate for a few weeks before resuming the up-move. We will wait for the price to complete the correction and show signs of a turnaround before suggesting a trade in it.

LINK/USD

Chain Link (Link) announced a collaboration with IoTeX on oracle research and development to provide real-world data to blockchain applications. It also tied up with Ampleforth and Neblio in the past seven days.

The sharp rally in the LINK/USD pair could not sustain above $4. In the past two weeks, the pair corrected to $2.60, which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $2.4465. As the RSI is still deep in overbought territory, we expect the price to enter into a range for a few weeks.

Contrary to our assumption, if bears sink the digital currency below $2.4665, it can drop to $1.9671, which is the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement of the rally. A breakdown of this support will be a negative move. We suggest traders wait for the formation of a clear range before initiating long positions.

XMR/USD

Though Monero (XMR) fell over 10% in the past seven days, it was the third-best performer. It has been a consistent performer in the past few weeks. Can it keep up the momentum and move up or will it enter a corrective phase? Let’s look at the charts.

Contrary to our assumption, the rebound in the XMR/USD pair hit a wall at $108.840. The price has turned down sharply and is retesting the critical support at $81. This is a bearish sign. Both the moving averages and the horizontal support are located at this level, hence, we anticipate a strong defense by the bulls. If successful, we might see another attempt by the bulls to propel the price towards $120.

However, if the digital currency plunges below $81, it can drop to the next support at $60.147. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests consolidation in the short term. The traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $78.

BNB/USD

The world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the launch of margin trading with its 2.0 platform. Though margin trading is risky, with proper risk management, it can be a boon to the experienced trader. Novices, however, should stay away from margin trading. The exchange announced support to additional pairs on its fiat-enabled trading platform in Singapore. Its research arm said that merged mining can mitigate the effects of halvings for Bitcoin and Litecoin. How does Binance Coin’s (BNB) chart look?

The BNB/USD pair continues to be strong with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI still in the positive territory. The bulls held the first support of $28.7168 during the week, which is also a positive sign. They will now attempt a recovery from the current levels. If the support holds, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks.

However, if the rebound fizzles out and the pair plunges below $28.7168, it can correct to the uptrend line. The 20-week EMA is also located at this level, hence, we expect the bulls to defend this support. Traders can watch this level closely and initiate long positions on a strong bounce off it, but should stay away if this support cracks.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) again climbed back into the list of top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the past week. The list of winners of the first Stellar Community Fund was announced on July 9. Can the digital currency maintain its spot in the top ten or will it correct and lose its spot?

The XLM/USD pair has dropped to the bottom of $0.0850–$0.1450 range. The 20-week EMA has started to slope down and the RSI is back in the negative territory, which suggests that the bears are back in action. A breakdown of the range can result in a retest of the lows. The pair will become very negative if the bears sink the price to new yearly lows.

However, if the price rebounds off the support of $0.085, bulls will attempt to push it back towards the top of the range at $0.01450. Traders should wait for the price to show a strong bounce before entering a trade in it.

Cashback rewards have been made popular by credit card companies seeking to attract new customers for their cards. Fortunately, for cryptocurrency users, there are also bitcoin cashback reward platforms that pay shoppers small rebates in bitcoin when making purchases with supported merchants.

In this guide, you will discover the top five bitcoin cashback rewards apps that you can use to get free bitcoin when shopping online.

BitcoinRewards

Australia-based BitcoinRewards enables users across the globe to earn bitcoin rewards at some of the most popular online merchants.

Users can receive bitcoin cashback rewards ranging from 0.8% to 40% of the purchase amount by shopping at vendors such as Booking.com, Coursera, Hotspot Shield, Nvidia, and Puma.

To start receiving digital currency cashback rewards, you need to sign up using a name and email address and then browse the list of supported merchants to find the goods or services they are seeking. Once a merchant has been chosen, you click the “Go to shop” button at which point a new tap opens with the merchant’s website. There you shop as you normally would and after around 48 hours, your BitcoinRewards account will be credited with the bitcoin cashback amount available for this specific vendor.

Aside from bitcoin, BitcoinRewards also provides cashback payments in bitcoin cash and binance coin.

CoinRebates

U.S.-based CoinRebates is an online cashback rewards platform that enables online shoppers to receive cash rebates in bitcoin.

Currently, the platform has a merchant network of over 300 retailers, which includes the likes of AliExpress, BestBuy, Carhartt, Lego, New Balance, Target, and Udemy.

To sign up, all you need is a bitcoin wallet address that is input on the website and then you can browse through the supported merchants to make your online purchases. Like on most bitcoin cashback platforms, rebates are usually credited after the purchased item’s return policy has run out (generally around 30 days).

Lolli

Lolli is perhaps the most popular bitcoin cashback app in the market today. The well-funded New York-based bitcoin startup enables crypto-savvy online shoppers to receive cashback rewards in bitcoin through its free Chrome extension.

To get started, you need to visit Lolli.com, add the Chrome extension, and sign up to the platform. Once signed in, you can scroll through the list of supported online shops and get starting with making your purchases. Ensure that the extension is activated when making purchases and then enjoy “stacking sats” as you shop online.

You will be informed of the amount of BTC you have earned after you have made a purchase. Currently, Lolli has a merchant network of over 500 retailers.

Pei

Los Angeles-based bitcoin startup Pei provides a mobile application that enables users to receive automatic cash rebates in BTC or USD when making purchases at partner merchants using their linked debit or credit cards.

Unlike other bitcoin cashback rewards apps, Pei also works with in-store payments as all rebates are linked to the user’s card purchases.

Supported merchants include the likes Burger King, Dunkin Donuts, Papa Johns, Starbucks, and Zara, among many more.

SatsApp

The newly launched Sats App with SatsBack by CasaHODL is the latest addition to the bitcoin cashback rewards landscape.

Launched on July 3, the SatsApp aims to make using the Bitcoin Lightning Network as easy as possible by enabling users to connect to their Casa Node using their smartphone. In addition, it wants to play its part in boosting Lightning Network adoption by allowing users to receive satoshi cashback rewards. Hence, the name “SatsBack” for this feature.

The SatsApp is available on Android and iOS and is currently only accessible to Casa Gold, Platinum and Diamond members.

Could bitcoin cashback help mass adoption?

The emergence and growth of the bitcoin cashback ecosystem could help to boost bitcoin adoption as more and more online shoppers may want to earn “free bitcoin” when making purchases that they would make either way.

The ease-of-use of Lolli’s Chrome extension or the Pei app’s card payment feature could attract a new user segment of thrifty shoppers to bitcoin. Whether these new users would then HODL their satoshi’s or spend them in the bitcoin economy would remain to be seen.",,https://cryptobriefing.com/racism-cryptocurrency-trump/,"Share this article

Cryptocurrency is an industry without borders. The very nature of decentralization and anonymity should preclude your geographical location, the color of your skin, your gender, your sexuality, your age, your religion, from mattering at all.

In that sense, it is one of the most powerful democratizing forces ever created by humans.

So when Donald Trump explains that he is “not a fan” of Bitcoin, perhaps there’s more to it than his concern over the usurpation of the dollar’s status as the de facto world currency.

Perhaps it’s just the racist demagogue in him, itching to prevent people who are non-white or non-male from achieving economic parity.

George W. Bush may have re-popularized the word ’emboldened’ when referring to terrorists, but one thing the former Republican President never forgot is that there is a difference between “threats such as terrorism, infectious disease, criminal gangs and drug trafficking” and “nationalism distorted into nativism – [forgetting] the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America”.

‘Emboldened’ must be exactly how Donald Trump feels today, after tweeting a racist slur against four members of the House of Representatives. Without naming the four women of color, Trump finally summoned up the ‘courage’ to abandon his dog-whistling cover – and to overtly assert that his agenda is based entirely on white privilege. Specifically, white male privilege.

So interesting to see “Progressive” Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly…… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 14, 2019

I’m an immigrant from the United Kingdom – I have lived in the United States for almost 20 years. My partners and colleagues who work with Crypto Briefing are from all over the world. We have people in the UK, Russia, Estonia, South Africa, France, Kenya, Bulgaria, Canada, Australia, Italy.

We are a decentralized company, because we welcome and value ideas, talent, and innovation… wherever we find people who embody those qualities. America has a staggering pool of talent. Planet Earth has an even more impressive one.

I have never, not once, come across a single instance of racism in this industry.

That’s not to say it doesn’t exist. But it must be hard, for a racist, to work in a sector that’s so blind to color (and that, despite the well-documented gender disparity at the intersection of technology and finance, seems to be trying to adopt a more mature attitude to the inclusion of women as well).

You might think it would also be hard to be President of the United States, and also a racist. But anomalies are part of any system.

I was asked by a reader the other day if we would keep politics out of our Twitter feed, and my response was – “Why? Crypto is political!”

It’s political because cryptocurrency represents a radical means of reducing inequality. In some cases, of course, it has created MORE inequality – as many emerging technologies do. Some people have become rich, others poor, and it’s not always fair. Neither is capitalism, or communism: economic perfection belongs to the future.

But the long-term prospects for cryptocurrencies – such as including billions of people in the economic systems that our world depends on – are unprecedented, and digital assets could be part of that future.

Economics is a political discipline. Inclusion is a political issue. Self-sovereignty and the degree to which we cede power to the state, or a corporation, is the definition of politics.

This technology could reshape society.

No wonder that privileged, white, racist men are so afraid of it.

P.S. If you’re looking for something fun to do on a Sunday afternoon, and you’re not sure what I’m really talking about, count the number of faces on Donald Trump’s Twitter header that are not white.",2019-07-14 19:12:47+00:00,https://nairametrics.com/2019/07/14/6-features-to-look-out-for-in-a-cryptocurrency/,"There are currently over 2,000 cryptocurrencies and counting. While this indicates that more people are using crypto to solve everyday problems. It is important to be able to differentiate supposed cryptocurrencies from actual cryptocurrencies especially as a cryptocurrency investor.

In this article, we take a look at 6 features every cryptocurrency should have using Bitcoin as a benchmark.

1. Elimination of a Central Party

This is the most distinctive feature between fiat (naira) and cryptocurrency. For fiat, the government and financial institutions give it the value it has. You can use a piece of paper to carry out transactions because the government has placed some value on that piece of paper.

Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are peer-to-peer. Its creation is regulated by the blockchain and eliminates control by a central party

2. Virtual

Cryptocurrencies only exist online. This means that unlike fiat, it does not have paper or coins.

3. Single Spending

It’s not possible to spend one bitcoin or one ethereum twice or thrice with various users in an attempt to purchase an item. Cryptocurrencies can only be spent once, eliminating the possibility of double spending.

4. Immutable

Cryptocurrency transactions cannot be reversed. When a transaction occurs on the cryptocurrency network, it is recorded on the blockchain. For it to be reversed, it would mean that most nodes (think of these as computers) in the blockchain need be altered. Which is an impossible feat to accomplish.

5. Anonymous

Transactions are done anonymously on the blockchain. This means that senders and receivers have a unique set of characters (public key) which they use to send or receive money without the sender or receiver knowing who owns the public key.

Think of it this way, say you want to donate to a charity that accepts Bitcoin you can send value to them without them know who sent it. However, using the transaction ID you can track the transaction to know when they receive it.

Near Instant Transaction

Cryptocurrency transactions are processed quickly irrespective of the receiver’s or sender’s location.

Final Note

One thing to keep in mind is the fact that cryptocurrency is not a Ponzi or get-rich-quick scheme. It is a transparent system that was created to revolutionise the financial system. So, before you stamp any coin as a cryptocurrency, step back and ask yourself if it possesses features above.

""Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,"" Trump tweeted.

The President's tweets on fly in the face of comments made just one day earlier by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who acknowledged that while Bitcoin may be far from mass adoption it is ""a speculative store of value, like gold.""

Twitter

Powell's remarks came during testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday about Facebook's recently announced Libra cryptocurrency project.

Among several tweets, Trump took direct aim at Facebook, which after months of speculation unveiled plans to launch its own fiat-backed cryptocurrency and digital wallet where the currency can be stored.

The President's comments could also spark debate among Democratic presidential candidates over the country's regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies and the underpinning technology – blockchain, an electronic distributed ledger.

Worldwide, blockchain-derived business value is forecast to grow from $9 billion this year to $50 billion in 2022, according to Gartner. The greatest growth between now and then is expected to take place in 2020, when Facebook plans to launch its Libra coin and Calibra digital wallet; that year alone will see a 128% annual increase in business value.

Trump tweeted Facebook Libra's ""virtual currency"" will have little standing or dependability.

""If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National,"" Trump wrote. Those comments came one day after he criticized both Facebook and Twitter for what he called bias against his supporters.

Like other cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currency, Facebook's digital money would be purchased through a typical financial network and then stored in the Calibra digital wallet application for making purchases via ads on the social media platform. A user could also do the same thing through Facebook's most popular communication platforms: WhatsApp and Messenger.

Facebook Images of the Calibra digital wallet app.

Facebook did not respond to questions by Computerworld about whether the president's comments would affect its plans to issue a cryptocurrency.

Avivah Litan, a vice president of research at Gartner, said while it's ""very difficult"" to analyze Trump's intentions from his tweets, ""it sounds to me like he is gearing up to clamp down on cryptocurrency adoption by Americans.

""It wouldn't surprise me if Trump tries to ban ownership or use in the U.S., but there are still checks and balances in the U.S. governmental system and any ban would likely be challenged in court and/or by Congress,"" Litan said.

Martha Bennett, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, said regulators and central bankers around the world are already concerned about Facebook's plans and regulatory scrutiny – or outright government intervention – of cryptocurrency and token schemes.

""Given the large global user base of Facebook, it's understandable that regulators everywhere insist that Libra will have to be compliant with existing regulations around Know Your Customer and AML [anti-money laundering],"" Bennett said via email. ""And that they also need more detail on the exact nature of Libra in order to ensure that there's no systemic risk.""

For example, Bennett pointed to comments by Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who said last week that ""it's got to be rock solid right from the start. Or it's not going to start.""

""Whether Libra is regulated as a bank or as a payment systems provider is a separate discussion – it all depends on the services it provides. Last, but by no means least, there's no doubt an additional element in play given Facebook's past behaviors around customer data,"" Bennett said.

Alex Tapscott, the co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute, a think tank whose members include CIBC, the Depository Trust and Clearance Corp. (DTCC), PNC Bank and tech firms such as IBM and Salesforce, believes Trump's tweets could have a chilling effect on blockchain in general.

""I think the President is wrong to demonize the technology. Blockchain in my mind and in the minds of many experts is one of the greatest technology innovations in a generation,"" Tapscott said. ""We'll see if his tweets leads to a substantive policy shift. Sometimes he's just expressing his opinion.""

Facebook's potential to onboard its 2.4 billion users to cryptocurrency use is the most consequential move for the industry to date, Tapscott said. He does not believe the Trump comments will increase scrutiny around Facebook's crypto project, and argued that the social media giant had already put itself in a harsh spotlight with its past privacy problems.

If the President were to take a hostile regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies, however, it could result in the U.S. ceding its current innovation leadership to other parts of world - most obviously China, a nation Trump has often made his political ""punching bag,"" Tapscott said.

""They are already rivaling us in terms of the internet. There are more internet users in China than the U.S. by factor of two or three. They're way ahead of us in the mobile payments industry with Alipay and WeChat,"" Tapscott said.

""China's internet industry is already very sophisticated, but the country also has its own issues,"" Tapscott continued. ""China is not a free market. They're free to regulate human behavior. I don't think we want an authoritarian government leading the way on one of the most important industries of the future.

""We are at this important inflection point in terms of the future of cryptocurrency technology and the future of our economy,"" Tapscott said, ""and the U.S. runs a real risk if it turns its head away from this technology..., letting China lead the way.""

China and Russia have both clamped down on the use of Bitcoin, initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency mining, a method of using computer processing power to create new cryptocurrency via an algorithm. China, however, has also considered creating its own national digital currency based on blockchain.

Last year, Yao Qian, who heads up research in the field at the People's Bank of China, said ""there should be a single bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) incorporating elements of cryptocurrency.""

Jonathan Johnson, a board member of Overstock.com and president of its venture capital arm, Medici Ventures, said stablecoins like the one Facebook is launching actually lessen volatility and are easier for a novice to use comfortably. The IRS, Johnson predicted, will need to start treating cryptocurrencies like fiat currencies – not assets – ""otherwise, it is too complicated from a tax perspective to use them.

More than five years ago, Overstock.com became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin as a form of payment for goods. Today, it accepts more than 40 versions of the digital currency for online purchases.

About the same time the online retailer was embracing bitcoin for payments, it put a venture capital stake in blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) through Medici Ventures, its Salt Lake City-based subsidiary. JP Morgan Chase has also launched its own fiat-backed cryptocurrency and blockchain is being piloted for use in a wide variety of markets, from healthcare and shipping to FinTech and real estate.

""This is an important technology and one that creates lots of economic value and lots of jobs, but it shouldn't exist without thoughtful policy and regulation,"" Tapscott said. ""But what's not productive is to write it off wholesale.""",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-could-rise-if-facebooks-crypto-survives-congress-hearings,"Bitcoin has come under pressure ahead of the U.S. governmental hearings on Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency on July 16 and 17.

The price of a single bitcoin, which stood near $13,000 five days ago, fell below $10,000 earlier today and tested the 50-day moving average at $9,900 for the first time since February 18.

Facebook’s head of Calibra – one of the entities set up to govern and develop the crypto project – David Marcus is scheduled testify to lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.

The upcoming scrutiny of Libra may be weighing over bitcoin. After all, past data shows BTC tends to drop ahead of congressional hearings related to cryptocurrencies and rise on favorable outcomes.

Last year, for instance, BTC fell from $6,820 to $6,070 in five days to July 12, before rallying to $7,400 on July 18 when the House Committee on Financial Services gathered for a hearing on “crypto as a new form of money”.

More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following days and rose to a high of $8,500 on July 24 (according to Bitstamp data) because the hearing didn’t take an overly negative tone.

On similar lines, BTC dropped from $12,000 to $6,000 in the 10 days leading up to a congressional hearing on Feb. 6, 2018, where the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman and the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified before the Senate Banking Committee. That hearing was also surprisingly positive and BTC rose back to levels above $11,700 by Feb. 20.

Going further back, the price action seen ahead of bitcoin’s first congressional hearing on Nov. 18, 2013, was slightly different in the sense that the cryptocurrency was solidly bid, rising from $85 to $650 in six weeks leading up to the event.

Again the hearing on the growing popularity of virtual currencies wasn’t anti-crypto, allowing BTC to extend the rally to highs above $1,150 on Nov. 30.

Will BTC rise this time round?

Facebook’s fiat and government bond backed cryptocurrency Libra is widely considered a net positive for bitcoin, an anti-establishment asset.

This is evident from the fact that BTC rallied from $9,000 to $13,800 in the eight days following Facebook’s unveiling of Libra’s white paper on June 18.

So, it is hardly surprising that the leading cryptocurrency is feeling the pull of gravity ahead of the congressional hearings on Libra and will likely take a hit if the U.S. lawmakers throw a spanner in the works for Facebook.

It is worth noting that the likes of the Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell have already called for a halt to Facebook’s project until concerns from privacy to money laundering are addressed. President Trump also criticized the project in tweets last week.

BTC, however, may rise well past $13,800 and possibly hit record highs before the end of the third quarter if the hearings are more optimistic.

A far as the technical charts are concerned, the short-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices hold above $9,614 (July 2 low).

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,300 on Bitstamp, representing 4.86 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

Daily and 3-day charts

A UTC close below $9,614 would invalidate the bullish higher-lows pattern and confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

That looks likely with the three-day chart reporting a bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI). The indicator has also dived out of the ascending trendline, signaling the end of the rally from December lows.

Further, the previous three-candle closed well below the 10-candle moving average, a level which acted as strong support throughout the rise from $3,500 to $13,880, as discussed on Friday.

Weekly chart

The long upper wicks attached to two out of the last three candles indicates bullish exhaustion and so does the bearish divergence of the RSI.

All-in-all, the charts are biased for a drop to $9,097 (May 30 high), unless the congressional hearings are more positive than expected. In that case, prices may rise above $13,800, signaling a continuation of the rally.

Hourly chart

BTC has recovered from lows near $9,850 to $10,300. The bearish lower-highs pattern, however, is still intact. Prices may rise to $11,200 in the next 24 hours if the cryptocurrency invalidates the bearish lower highs pattern with a move above $10,732.

This week, two US Congressional committees—the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee—will hold hearings on Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency.

Aside from the slow regulatory response to Bitcoin from agencies including the SEC and FINRA and crypto fraud investigations undertaken by the FTC, the hearings will be the highest profile governmental-oversight measures we've seen to date regarding cryptocurrencies. Yet one danger with the hearings is the potential for committee members to get mired in inaccurate comparisons between Bitcoin and Libra rather than examining the financial and global ripple effects of Facebook's ambitious undertaking.

While both Bitcoin and Libra are crypto assets that can be transacted as digital currencies, that's where the similarities end. It seems that even the President needs a lesson on why lumping the two together does a disservice to both.

....Similarly, Facebook Libra's ""virtual currency"" will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

A good place to start is this comparison chart from CryptoPotato breaking down the major differences.

From a basic blockchain perspective, Bitcoin is completely decentralized with a vast number of nodes operating worldwide. It's also permissionless; anyone with the hardware and technical knowledge can start mining. The core issue with this from a payments perspective is that it takes too long to validate transactions, which is why Libra is more or less the opposite: It's based on a relatively centralized blockchain governed by the Libra Association to keep transactions fast and scalable, and for the foreseeable future, it'll be permissioned. Only authorized entities can add transactions to the ledger, and the majority of Libra's founding members are tech and financial companies.

How Bitcoin and Libra's values and monetary systems work are also very different. Bitcoin works off a fixed supply of coins created during its inception a decade ago, and its price is not tied to any aspect of the traditional financial system. Libra,, on the other hand, is backed by a basket of fiat currencies and will always have exactly as many coins as its corresponding fiat pool's value. When a user exchanges dollars, euros, pounds, Swiss francs, yen, and so on for Libra, new corresponding assets are created. When they pay or cash out, those tokens are destroyed.

Source: Coin Center

This explainer and the above charts from nonprofit cryptocurrency research and advocacy organization Coin Center goes deeper into the coins' contrasting characteristics. Philosophically, Bitcoin is designed as peer-to-peer electronic cash that doesn't go through any third-parties or financial institutions, whereas Libra's lofty goal of becoming the foundation of a new digital financial system hinges on its 1:1 asset pegging to existing global currencies.

Coin Center likens Bitcoin to a valuable commodity, like gold—possessing some immediately provides value, which jibes with Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies' current primary usage as speculative investment assets rather than daily currency for payments. Conversely, Libra is more like a bank note or security; its value depends on what fiat currency it's backed by and can only be used in peer-to-peer transactions if approved by the backers.

The House Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee should have a laundry list of questions about how Libra works, how consumers will be protected, what oversight and regulations should be put in place, the Libra Association's governance structure and centralization of power, and how Facebook plans to profit off of it all with its new Calibra subsidiary.

What shouldn't happen is a repeat of Mark Zuckerberg's April 2018 congressional hearing, where committee members spent much of their time on basic or irrelevant lines of questioning. Given all the questions that should and must be raised during these hearings, let's hope the committees don't waste their time comparing Bitcoin and Libra.

Taking stock of community sentiment in light of Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations, McAfee wrote on July 15 that he was “laughing his f------ ass off” at the seemingly overblown negativity:

“Bitcoin is at the mid 10's and people worry. LMFAO!! Why do you pay attention to weekly fluctuations? Look at the past few months FFS! It's rising drastically. I'm still positive about my $1 mil BTC price by the end of 2020. Alt coins like MTC and Apollo will rise ten times more.”

As of press time, Bitcoin has indeed lost a round 9% on the week — almost 4% on the day — according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index, and is trading just north of $10,300.

Yet on the month, the coin’s chart shows a 23% gain — and caps a 100% gain over the three-month period to press time.

This summer, a Wall Street Journal report had revealed that the dizzying returns from Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust — which is up almost 300% on the year — had secured its spot as the best-performing fund in the market.

In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, McAfee predicted that 10 years from now, “there'll be no fiat anywhere in the world [...] everything will be cryptocurrency.”

A passionate, anti-government crusader whose charisma has secured him a presumably welcome degree of notoriety, McAfee is currently in exile in Cuba., due to alleged U.S. income tax evasion charges — and is running his second campaign for the American presidency.

Fellow Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano — co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Assets — recently predicted the coin would hit $100,000 by the end of 2021.

In contrast to McAfee’s bullish view of alts like doc.com Token (MTC) and Apollo (APL), American broadcaster Max Keiser has predicted that the altcoin phenomenon is over and all value will flow into bitcoin in the latest crypto bull market.

The stakes of McAfee’s forecast could not be higher: two years ago, he originally pledged to eat his dick on national television if Bitcoin didn’t hit $500,000 by 2020. Follow the countdown here.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/buterin-proposes-bitcoin-cash-integration-to-scale-ethereum-in-short-term,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has proposed to using the Bitcoin Cash blockchain as a temporary scalability solution for the Ethereum network. The programmer introduced a summary of the idea in a July 13 post on the Ethereum Research.

As previously reported, the Ethereum network has experienced some scalability issues, with its native blockchain capable of processing as few as 15 transactions per second (TPS), while its major competitor Ripple is reportedly estimated to have a TPS capacity of 1,500.

As such, the Ethereum community has been working on Ethereum 2.0, a major network upgrade that is expected to improve its scalability once ETH shifts from proof-of-work to the proof-of-stake algorithm.

While the first stages of the Ethereum 2.0 shift are expected to come in early 2020, Buterin has now suggested deploying other blockchains as a new option for improving Ethereum scalability in the short term. Specifically, Buterin said the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is a perfect match for this purpose as the hard fork cryptocurrency provides a data throughput of around 53 kilobytes (KB) per second, as opposed to Ethereum’s 8 KB.

Additionally, Buterin outlined three other compelling reasons for using the blockchain, including low fees, the readiness of necessary machinery and the Bitcoin Cash community’s openness to people using the blockchain “for whatever they want as long as they pay the transaction fees.”

In the post, Buterin noted Bitcoin Cash’s 10 minute block time as the main impediment to becoming a good Ethereum scalability solution. However, the expert noted that this problem could be solved by zero-confirmation payments using techniques like Avalanche pre-consensus.

The crypto community on Twitter took a negative view on Buterin’s new Bitcoin Cash integration proposal, with some commentators forecasting that such a scenario could lead both Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash to a faster collapse.

Francis Pouliot, co-founder of blockchain consulting firm Catallaxy, tweeted that the recent proposal by Buterin signifies a failure of the Ethereum project, while Bitcoin integration will just delay and unsolved scalability crisis.

Recently, another Ethereum co-founder, Joseph Lubin, claimed that Ethereum has “already scaled quite significantly.”",,https://www.coindesk.com/hacked-crypto-exchange-bitpoint-discovers-more-millions-are-missing,"UPDATE July 16, 6:25 UTC: In a follow-up post published on Tuesday, Bitpoint confirmed the stolen crypto assets included 1,225 bitcoin, 1,985 bitcoin cash, 11,169 ether, and 5,108 litecoin.

After announcing a $30-million hack last week, Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitpoint says it’s discovered that another $2.3 million is missing.

A report from Japan Today on Monday said the extra losses were discovered at exchanges outside Japan that were using Bitpoint’s trading system and announced Sunday.

The firm announced Friday that it had suffered a security breach arising in the loss of around 3.2 billion yen (almost $30 million) in cryptocurrencies. As a result, it halted all services including trading, deposits and withdrawals of all crypto assets.

By John Yearwood

Cred Correspondent

Amid a dramatic Bitcoin bull run, two of the most influential names in the blockchain finance industry have launched a platform to expand global lending and earning on investments in cryptocurrency.

The partnership between Bitcoin.com and Cred allows Bitcoin.com customers to earn up to 10 percent interest on Bitcoin and six percent on Bitcoin Cash invested with Cred, the companies said.

Customers with investments over $25,000 have been benefiting from the partnership for the last few months but it opens to all users, regardless of investment size, on July 15, 2019.

“We’re thrilled to offer Bitcoin.com customers the opportunity to earn interest on their digital assets,” said Dan Schatt, co-founder and president of Cred, a Silicon Valley-based decentralized global lending platform that facilitates open access to credit anywhere and anytime.

A major feature of the program is that interest will be offered in a customer’s choice of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash or Cred’s LBA Token. This new offering is a departure from only earning interest in USD and is based on community feedback asking for more interest options. It gives customers more freedom when it comes to reinvesting earned interest, Schatt said.

“Customers benefit by receiving the full upside on the amount of crypto they originally committed,” he said.

Bitcoin has surged by double digits this year, with the coin at one point pricing above $13,000 before retreating. Bitcoin.com, based in Tokyo but with offices around the world, is the leading source for Bitcoin information with more than four million Bitcoin wallets.

“At Bitcoin.com, we believe borrowing and earning services like Cred are a natural next step for Bitcoin wallet holders and will be very attractive to users of Bitcoin Cash,” said Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com. “In Cred, we have found a like-minded partner who shares our vision and brings significant experience and a solid track record in offering reliable, secure crypto-backed lending and borrowing services to the crypto community.”

Cred, founded by former executives of PayPal and Goldman Sachs, has taken numerous steps to ensure that its investments are safe. The company, which has secured more than $300 million in lending capital, has implemented the industry’s most comprehensive set of risk management, information security, and insurance protections, Schatt said.

“Crypto is still in many ways the Wild West when it comes to the fundamental safeguards most of us have come to expect when ensuring the protection of financial assets,” Schatt said. “Cred is on a mission to dramatically improve that. If the worst happens and Cred loses customer funds, customers deserve certainty that they will be made whole.”

The new program comes as the decentralized finance industry gets a boost from Facebook, which announced last month that it plans to introduce a Libra coin next year. The coin faces regulatory hurdles but experts predict it’s poised to transform the industry, which has a current market cap in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The U.S. Congress will discuss Facebook’s plans in hearings this week.

Bitcoin.com customers will be required to make a six-month commitment to benefit from the partnership. They will have the option to roll over assets for additional periods if they wish. Those who stake their investments with Cred’s LBA token will enjoy the best interest rates and the option for early withdrawal at no penalty before the six-month term.

Investments in the program will be used to help increase crypto lending globally, including with retail investors and money managers who have a well-established track record on a fully collateralized and guaranteed basis, Cred officials said.

“It’s important to note that Cred does not lend to short-sellers,” said Meghan Gardler, director of marketing at Cred. “These are two strong companies coming together to offer Bitcoin Cash holders a secure opportunity to diversify their investments, which will benefit business owners and others around the world seeking access to capital.”

Rockdale, Texas, an hour outside of Austin, was depending on a company called Bitmain – a Bitcoin “mining” company – to bring new jobs and revenue to the town after the Alcoa coal plant closed more than a decade ago. But when Bitcoin started losing value in 2018, Rockdale suffered. Bitmain postponed the opening of its facility, and ended up hiring a fraction of the several-hundred people it had originally promised.

Now, Bitmain says it will open its facility some time this summer, albeit on a much smaller scale. But for Rockdale, that might not be enough.

Mark Dent is an Austin-based freelance reporter who wrote about Bitmain and Rockdale for Wired. He says Bitmain’s troubles came at a time when Rockdale was already struggling economically – Dent calls it “Bitcoin winter.”

“It was a tough time for them, especially because of the way it went down,” Dent says. “There was also a couple of hospitals that closed in the last couple of years, and a coal plant; it just felt like more gloom and bad news.”

While Bitmain will likely open its facility by the end of this month, Dent says it won’t bring in the large number of jobs residents had hoped for when the facility was first proposed. And it certainly won’t be the worldwide Bitcoin-mining hub some had predicted it would be.

As a result, Dent says Rockdale is also looking for other ways to create jobs and bring in money.

“They’ve been talking now with some contractors who want to do a solar energy farm that could create a lot of jobs,” he says.

Orleans-Braganza, who is also a federal deputy in the Brazilian National Congress, spoke out during a special commission meeting wherein lawmakers discussed a bill that proposes a legal framework for digital currencies.

Orleans-Braganza said the bill should only be discussed in the Congress if there is high consumer demand for it. Otherwise, according to Orleans-Braganza, it is merely an example of the state intervening in something which is not its business:

""Good regulation is one that comes from the consumer's demand for something for which he felt injured and calls for state protection. I question this adventure of wanting to regulate something which consumers and companies organized to receive Bitcoin do not demand.”

Orleans-Braganza further noted that cryptocurrencies may sometimes be used under illicit circumstances, but that does not justify limitless regulation by the state.

The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Rodrigo Maia, requested the creation of the aforementioned special commission to deliver an opinion on the bill, which aims to regulate Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital currencies in Brazil, on May 30, 2019. The commission is composed of 34 members in accordance with the House Rules of Procedure.

In June, the Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil released new rules requiring that cryptocurrency exchanges inform the regulator about users' transactions in order to identify tax fraud. The agency now requires that cryptocurrency exchanges operators based in Brazil provide information about all transactions carried out within their system.",

The recent pullback of Bitcoin is widely believed to be a technical factor that was pushed by sellers who took control of the market once the dominant crypto asset went below key support levels at $11,000 and $10,700.

Alex Krüger, a global markets analyst, hinted that the criticism of Bitcoin by United States President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin could have contributed to the fall:

“When the U.S. government attacks bitcoin directly, saying it’s exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity, based on thin air, and how they are concerned about its speculative nature, and the crypto echo chamber roars ‘bullish,’ it probably is a good time to short. There is nothing bullish in antagonizing with the largest gorilla in the room. Most U.S. politicians unfortunately seem to be convinced crypto is the realm of money laundering and drug trafficking. This needs to change. I bet people use Paypal or Venmo more than bitcoin to pay for illicit activities. Also bet most criminals don't even know what monero is, yet they all heard about the dollar. Unfortunately, perception trumps facts.”

The change in sentiment around the crypto market following the remarks of President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin, as well as bearish technical indicators, are considered to be the major factors behind Bitcoin’s most recent correction.

Why President Trump’s and Secretary Mnuchin’s statements may not be bullish for Bitcoin

Some industry executives, like Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert and Ikigai Fund founder Travis Kling, have said that the remarks on Bitcoin by President Trump and Secretary Mnuchin can be acknowledged as a bullish event for the first cryptocurrency.

Essentially, Silbert and Kling stated that Bitcoin has gained enough awareness and interest from the mainstream and a broader market of investors to the extent in that the President of the largest economy in the world was pressured to comment on its growth. Kling was quoted saying:

“The Chairman of the Fed and the Treasury Security both agree that Bitcoin is a speculative store of value. Both of them, along with the President, agree that Libra and Bitcoin are two very different things. Wildly no bullish,”

Silbert, who leads a venture capital firm in the cryptocurrency sector, similarly expressed optimism toward the remarks. When Secretary Mnuchin held an official briefing at the White House about cryptocurrency regulation, Silbert said that it was “complete and total validation of bitcoin,” adding in a Twitter post:

“Never imagined I'd be watching the Treasury Secretary of the United States hold a press briefing from the White House re bitcoin and cryptocurrencies so soon.”

However, the actual messages delivered by Secretary Mnuchin and President Trump were not positive, with President Trump describing Bitcoin as a speculative asset with value based on thin air. Secretary Mnuchin, echoing the sentiments of President Trump, stated that financial authorities in the U.S. will tighten oversight on the cryptocurrency sector, warning against bigger scrutiny from regulators. Mnuchin stated:

“There are many regulatory and supervisory questions regarding libra, virtual assets, and virtual currencies. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cybercrime, tax evasion, exortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, and human trafficking. Many players have attempted to use cryptocurrencies to fund their malign behavior. This is indeed a national security issue.”

With the formation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s Working Group on Digital Assets by the Treasury Department, Secretary Mnuchin also warned that money transmitters and other entities operating within the crypto sector will be governed by agencies like FinCEN, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at full capacity. The U.S. Treasury Secretary also added:

“The rules governing money service providers apply to physical and electronic transactions alike. As money service businesses, cryptocurrency money transmitters are subject to compliance examinations, just like every other U.S. bank. To be clear, FINCEN will hold any entity that transact in bitcoin, Libra, or any other cryptocurrency to its highest standards.”

How will markets continue to react?

Speaking to Cointelegraph, a cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst known to the community as Satoshi Flipper stated that despite volatility in the price of Bitcoin and other major crypto assets, there are many fundamental catalysts for Bitcoin to observe.

Several fundamental factors for Bitcoin in the near term include the emergence of trading venues like the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt and custodial services from major financial institutions, such as Fidelity. In anticipation of the block reward halving in May 2020, many miners are reportedly intending to hold onto Bitcoin, expecting the block reward halving to impose a positive effect on the medium to the long-term trend of the asset.

In a block reward halving, a mechanism of the Bitcoin blockchain protocol that is triggered in approximately every four years, the reward miners receive in Bitcoin for mining blocks for the blockchain network is decreased by half. Consequently, the rate in which new Bitcoin are mined drops, causing the circulating supply of the asset and the pace in which new supply of the asset is sent to exchanges declines. Satoshi Flipper went on to clarify:

“There are so many catalysts for bitcoin right now. Too many to list. But this time around, Wall Street and mature institutional players are much more involved in trading and building products around #Bitcoin for adoption. Everywhere you look now, you can see cryptocurrency influence starting to take hold. All industries are getting involved. I expect this major push for adoption to accelerate even more during this current bull market. To the point where in a few years, we will see Bitcoin and crypto influence in everyday life.”

Brian Kelly, the CEO of BKCM, said on CNBC’s Fast Money that many miners he had spoken to in May have confirmed to have secured sufficient capital to sustain their operations for an extra 12 months. The intent of financing 12 months of operations, according to Kelly, is to hoard Bitcoin and refrain from selling the asset. Kelly explained:

“I've talked to a lot of miners around the world, a lot of them have said they have sold enough bitcoin to get us through the next year or so and we are going to hoard bitcoin at this point in time and we are not going to sell it and the supply of bitcoin will get cut in half. Just real simple economics: lots of demand hitting little supply, price goes higher.”

The drop in the price of Bitcoin from around $10,500 to below $9,500 within minutes came across as a shock to many investors and traders — not because of the range, but due to the speed of the decline. In the short term, traders expect Bitcoin to sustain its volatility and struggle to recover beyond key resistance levels. Peter Brandt, a best-selling author and a highly regarded trader, stated on Twitter that the total market cap of Bitcoin could correct by 80% based on technical indicators:

“While the parabola in BTC was subject to different renderings, the parabola in the total market cap chart was loud and clear. Total cap should correct 80%. Most of the damage of decline will occur to altcoins.”

Is Libra a factor?

Throughout the past several days, Libra, a cryptocurrency created by the Libra Association, a consortium based in Switzerland kickstarted by Facebook, has faced fierce criticism from the U.S. government. U.S. House Representative Kevin McCarthy, who publicly expressed optimism toward Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature, shared concerns regarding Libra:

“When I’m on Facebook, I’m not the customer, I’m the product. Facebook is free because they sell your data to make money. Now they want to get into the business, and they’re not Bitcoin, in this Libra. They’re not decentralized. I want to see decentralization because Libra concerns me that they’re going to control the market.”

When Libra first released its white paper to the public, executives of cryptocurrency companies including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that it brought significant attraction to the market, leading stalled contracts to materialize. It is therefore possible that the unveiling of Libra led to a spike in retail interest in late June and that the increasing scrutiny from regulators could hinder the near-term future of Libra, which may lead some investors to doubt the short-term performance of the crypto market.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/complete-indian-cryptocurrency-draft-bill-leaked-experts/,"Complete Indian Draft Crypto Bill Leaked - Experts Weigh In

A draft cryptocurrency bill for India has been leaked in full, but details of the bill have raised some questions. News.Bitcoin.com talked to a number of experts in the field who shared their analyses of the bill’s content and its implications on the Indian crypto industry.

A Complete Draft Bill Surfaces

The draft cryptocurrency bill, which has been causing quite a stir within the Indian crypto community, has surfaced in its entirety. Varun Sethi, founder of Blockchain Lawyer, shared on Monday the document entitled Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019. News.Bitcoin.com previously provided a preliminary analysis of this rumored bill after Bloombergquint and The Economic Times made outrageous claims about it.

India is currently deliberating on the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency. An interministerial committee headed by Finance Secretary and Secretary of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg was tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrency and recommending crypto regulation for India. Garg said last month that his committee’s report was ready to be submitted to the finance minister for approval.

Important: Bill Is Unofficial and RBI Denies Involvement

Before paying much attention to this bill, there are several important points to note. First and foremost, this bill was not announced by the Indian government so its veracity is in dispute.

Advocate Mohammed Danish, co-founder of Crypto Kanoon, an Indian platform for blockchain and crypto regulatory news and analysis, told news.Bitcoin.com:

This document cannot be claimed as the final recommendation of the expert committee to the Ministry of Finance. The document contains no mark of authentication on it nor it has come out from any official source.

Another important observation is that at least one of the regulators listed on this bill has denied its involvement. The last page of the bill provides a list of “appropriate regulators,” namely the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, the Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), “and any other appropriate regulator as may be notified by the central government.”

However, in its reply to a Right to Information (RTI) request filed by Sethi, the RBI stated last month that it did not have any knowledge of this bill. In addition, the central bank confirmed that it neither proposed a ban on crypto assets nor had knowledge of any other government departments doing so. After sharing a copy of the bill, Sethi asserted Monday:

This looks like a very very rough draft of a proposed bill … [it might be] just a random discussion paper and it may not actually become [a] bill in the same manner and mode in which this has been stated.

Draft Bill Far From Becoming Law, Plenty of Changes Expected

Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, immediately tweeted in response to the leaked bill. He advised everyone not to panic until a bill becomes law. “This crypto bill has not been introduced in [the] current Parliament session,” he emphasized. “This looks like a rough draft, plenty of changes to come.” Shetty has been running a Twitter campaign calling for the Indian government to introduce positive regulation for cryptocurrency.

He explained to news.Bitcoin.com that “The Monsoon session of Parliament will not be discussing this bill, which means now we need to see if it gets discussed in the next parliament session which might be in December,” adding:

Regardless, there are many bills pending to be discussed in Parliament so there’s low likelihood of this bill being heard.

The CEO opined: “If this is a real draft then it’s a very regressive approach to new technology. I’m certain our lawmakers will question and amend it such that the ban applies on money laundering and not on entrepreneurship or public participation.”

Sumit Gupta, CEO of local crypto exchange Coindcx, said to news.Bitcoin.com that “I am not sure if the government will actually go ahead and implement this, given the recent discussions Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had at the G20 summit in Japan.”

India, along with other G20 nations, declared its commitment last month to applying the crypto standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Sitharaman and other G2 finance ministers and central bank governors also jointly declared their commitments to applying the FATF crypto standards.

Gupta believes that “If this becomes a law, this would be one of the biggest mistakes by the Indian government.” He described, “We will see blockchain startups moving out of the country, proficient blockchain developers moving abroad or working only on foreign projects,” adding:

At a global level, the industry will keep on growing, innovation will keep on happening, and India will lose out its technological edge, just because the government is not ready to understand this technology well.

Advocate Danish believes that “based on the language of the document coupled with other information based on earlier filed RTIs, it can be safely assumed that it may be that document which the committee has recommended.”

Positive and Surprising Aspects of the Bill

Sethi noticed some positive and surprising aspects of the bill. Firstly, according to the bill, cryptocurrency “means any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.”

Surprised that this definition includes “any information,” Sethi pointed out how this bill’s definition of crypto is “massively different from the interpretation” of other countries. As an example, he explained that if he encrypted a message to tell his friend that it is raining in Delhi and his friend decided to cancel his business trip based on this message, that piece of information would be considered cryptocurrency based on this bill’s definition.

Secondly, he also noticed that the bill allows cryptocurrency to be used for research purposes. He raised the question of what if all developers declare that their crypto projects are for research purposes. Moreover, if a college professor issues tokens for research purposes, Sethi questioned whether the professor would be allowed to sell the tokens and if anyone would be allowed to buy them.

Professor A. Damodaran of the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore shared some thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com regarding the aforementioned bill. He remarked, “It is narrowly scoped. By design, the bill is meant to strengthen India’s Payment and Settlements Act 2007 and attack money laundering. Crypto tokens (including ICOs) which are assets/ securities are out of the ambit of this Bill,” elaborating:

The good news is that the bill does not prevent crypto tokens from being used as a development instrument to help India’s unbanked population, most of whom are poverty ridden.

About the Rumored Draft Bill

The draft bill has six main parts. Part 1 introduces the bill, states that it applies to all of India, and defines 18 terms including cryptocurrency, digital rupee, distributed ledger technology, foreign digital currency, investment schemes, miner, mining, and the RBI.

Part 2 outlines the activities prohibited. Part 3 addresses the regulation of the digital rupee and foreign digital currency, as well as prohibition on various uses of cryptocurrency. It also describes offenses and penalties. Part 4 details the powers of the investigating authority while Part 5 talks about the penalties and proceedings. The last part of the bill covers miscellaneous items such as “protection of action taken in good faith.”

The bill also proposes to amend the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002, and also provides a list of five appropriate regulators, as previously mentioned.

Proposed Prohibitions and Offenses

Advocate Danish further told news.Bitcoin.com: “Now coming to the provisions of the bill, the definition clause attempts to transgress than what is actually required which is giving rise to confusion in understanding the terms like ‘cryptocurrency’ and ‘distributed ledger technology’ among others. The bill prescribes punishment of fine/jail term of up to 10 years for even buying, selling and storing of cryptocurrency. The bill not just cracks down on industry players but it also gives a shock to influencers by prescribing jail term up to 7 years for soliciting or inducing participation for use of cryptocurrency.” He noted:

By making some of offences cognizable and non-bailable, this bill conveys a clear message about the policy of zero tolerance.

Danish continued: “I must say that for implementing such a special legislation, the administration/ investigating agency must be well equipped. And I don’t think the decision of Home Ministry to provide special training to the police officials in September is a coincidence.” The advocate is referring to the cryptocurrency course by the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy for high-ranking officers, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

Regarding the content of the bill, Chapter 5 deals with “prohibition on use of cryptocurrency,” which excludes “digital rupee, or any foreign digital currency recognized as foreign currency in India.” Section 7 of this chapter explains that “Cryptocurrency shall not be used as legal tender or currency at any place in India … No person shall directly or indirectly use cryptocurrency in any manner, including as – (a) a medium of exchange; and/or (b) a store of value; and/or (c) a unit of account.”

Section 8 of this chapter states that “No person shall directly or indirectly use cryptocurrency” for the activities subsequently spelled out. The activities are “as a payment system; buy or sell or store cryptocurrency; provide cryptocurrency related services to consumers or investors which includes registering, trading, settling, clearing or other services; trade cryptocurrency with Indian currency or any foreign currency; issue cryptocurrency related financial products; as a basis of credit; issue cryptocurrency as a means of raising funds; and/or as a means for investment.”

Chapter 6 of the bill lists offenses: “Whoever directly or indirectly mines, generates, holds, sells, deals in, transfers, disposes of or issues cryptocurrency or any combination thereof with an intent to use it for any of the purposes mentioned in [Section 7 and 8] … shall be punishable with fine as may be prescribed by the central government in the First Schedule or with imprisonment which shall not be less than one year but which may extend up to ten years, or both.” News.Bitcoin.com has previously provided some analysis of this bill.

Helping Indian Government Understand Crypto

Sethi explained to news.Bitcoin.com that this bill presents an opportunity to talk to the government about cryptocurrency. Noting that most of the bill “looks as if crypto is a crime on [the] same terms as child pornography or kidnapping,” he reiterated that “a more democratic conversation is needed with the government to make them understand what the real matter is,” suggesting:

Things like the results we got from the signature campaign shall now become more relevant … we can use it to talk to the government now.

Last month, Sethi started a campaign on Change.org for the government to start regulating the crypto industry. He now urges stakeholders to “ramp up efforts” to engage with the government to help them understand.

Akshay Aggarwal, Blocumen Studios CEO and co-founder of Blockchained India, shared with news.Bitcoin.com that “It is sad to see that after witnessing the largest industry consultation drive in India, the government didn’t pay any heed to the recommendations of the industry stakeholders.” Blockchained India recently hosted a conference called India Dapp Fest, after organizing a series of roadshow town halls for anyone to voice their regulatory suggestions. Nonetheless, he maintains:

There is still time that the Indian government takes an open outlook towards ensuring that the young entrepreneurs grab opportunities that this paradigm shift presents.

The Indian government has not given a timeframe for when the recommended crypto regulation will be made public. However, the country’s supreme court is scheduled to hear the crypto case on July 23. The court is expected to address the writ petitions against the banking restriction imposed by the central bank. The RBI issued a circular in April last year banning regulated entities from providing services to crypto businesses.

The court may also follow up on its request made in February for the government to submit the crypto regulatory report from the Garg committee within four weeks. However, the case was postponed and the court has yet to follow up on this request.

Under the rules, set to come into force late this month, crypto-related firms will voluntarily abide by standards on capital requirements and consumer protection and pay tax in France, in exchange for approval from the regulator.

“France is a precursor. We will have a legal, tax and regulatory framework,” said Anne Marechal, executive director for legal affairs at the Financial Markets Authority.

“We are in talks with three or four candidates for initial coin offerings (ICOs),” she said, referring to companies that raise funds by issuing digital tokens. The watchdog is also in talks with several other cryptocurrency exchange platforms, custodians and fund managers, she added.

Cryptocurrencies are subject to patchy rules across the world, with the technology remaining mostly unregulated. While some smaller countries from Belarus to Malta have brought in specific laws, major economies have tended to applying existing financial rules.

Global scrutiny of cryptocurrencies has grown since Facebook FB.O unveiled plans last month for its Libra digital coin. The entry of the social media giant to cryptocurrencies has raised concerns among politicians and financial watchdogs in the United States and elsewhere over privacy, consumer protection and the potential for systemic risks.

Some crypto-related companies and industry associations have called for regulation of the sector, in part because of a desire for legal clarity and because of the perception of respectability that accompanies such rules.

“When you are an entrepreneur, the worst that can happen to you is to set up your business where there is no regulation, to see an adverse regulatory framework later imposed that jeopardizes your whole business,” said Frederic Montagnon, the co-founder of LGO, a New York-based cryptocurrency platform that chose to launch an ICO in France.

France is using its presidency of the Group of 7 economic powers to launch a task force to look at how central banks can ensure digital currencies like Libra are regulated.

European Central Bank policymaker Benoit Coeure is due to deliver a preliminary report on the matter this week at a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Chantilly, north of Paris.

Paris first proposed rules to attract cryptocurrency issuers to France last year amid a boom for ICOs. Then, hundreds of new cryptocurrencies were issued every month raising billions of euros.

But ICOs have since dropped sharply, as issuers of cryptocurrencies turn to other forms of fundraising such as initial exchange offerings, where issuers raise money over crypto trading platforms and exchanges.",2019-07-16 11:27:40+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/i-like-bitcoin-says-house-gop-leader-mccarthy-hits-facebook-libra.html,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNBC on Tuesday that he likes the decentralized nature and the security of bitcoin.

""I like bitcoin"" and the security of the blockchain ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies, the California Republican said, as he criticized Facebook's plans for a Libra digital coin ahead of hearings on Capitol Hill this week.

Libra will be pegged to a basket of government-backed money, compared with bitcoin, which is highly volatile in price and derives value from factors including its ability to enable instantaneous, anonymous, global payments and as an investment.

Nobody controls bitcoin.

McCarthy did, however, say that bitcoin is not where it needs to be yet, alluding to the risks of cryptocurrencies being used by criminals and money launderers.

While Libra promises more stability, McCarthy remains concerned.

""When I'm on Facebook, I'm not the customer, I'm the product,"" he said. ""Facebook is free because they sell your data to make money. Now they want to get into the business, and they're not bitcoin, in this Libra. They're not decentralized.""

In Libra hearings by the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and House Financial Services on Wednesday, McCarthy said he's looking for the social media giant to address its potential anti-competitive behavior.

""I want to see decentralization because Libra concerns me that they're going to control the market,"" McCarthy said.

To address those concerns, Facebook set up Libra to be run by a nonprofit consortium supported by a range of firms and organizations, including including payment companies Visa and PayPal, as well as tech giants eBay, Lyft, Spotify and Uber.

Republican Sen. Pat Toomey strayed from McCarthy's and the Trump administration's critical views o Libra, telling CNBC in a separate interview Tuesday that Facebook's planned digital coin should be given a chance.

""I don't want to presume in advance that we've got to prevent the development of some new innovation,"" Toomey offered.

However, the Pennsylvania senator added he wants to know the real motivation behind Libra because Facebook has said that it's not about making money.",2019-07-16,https://www.coindesk.com/hackers-are-turning-binances-stolen-bitcoin-into-fiat,"UPDATE (16 July 2019, 14:51 UTC): A correction has been made to remove the suggestion that all of Binance’s stolen BTC has been moved into fiat. Many of the associated exchanges do not offer fiat pairs.

A new analysis by Coinfirm shows the movement of the bitcoin stolen from Binance into various wallets. The hack, which netted 7,000 BTC, happened on May 7, 2019 at 17:15:24 UTC and the hackers have been moving stolen bitcoin from wallet to wallet.

Now, however, Coinfirm has spotted some activity that suggests the hackers are moving their gains off of exchanges, potentially into other cryptocurrencies.

The first transaction happened here while other transactions followed. Most recently, however, it’s become clear that the hacker has begun liquidating the BTC on various exchanges.

“Analysis of one of the mainchains used by the hacker in layering stolen funds shows that they were able to liquidate at least 1.8087 BTC (21,000.00 USD) on the following exchanges,” said Coinfirm’s Grant Blaisdell. The transfers happened as follows:

Bitfinex: 0,7934 BTC Binance: 0,4294 BTC Bitmex: 0,0022 BTC KuCoin: 0,0713 BTC Kuna: 0,2482 BTC Bitmarket: 0,2560 BTC Crypterra: 0,0072 BTC Bitcoin.de: 0,0007 BTC WazirX: 0,0003 BTC

While caveats apply, it’s clear that the hacker moved an amount of BTC to each of these exchanges and there they either left the chain or remained dormant. This is obviously cold comfort to those who are watching their stolen crypto hop from exchange to exchange.

Tether (USDT) is now the most popular asset for buying Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that the latest rally is fueled by existing rather than new cryptocurrency investors.

In a report published today, U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley noted a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin trades against Tether. This increase coincided with a proportionate decrease in the number of BTC trades against popular fiat currencies, such as the Chinese renminbi (CNY) or US dollar.

As indicated in the graph below, USDT began to gain volume near the beginning of the 2017 ICO boom. At the time the U.S. dollar had been the most popular trading asset, following a steep decline in CNY transactions earlier that year.

Although bullish regulatory news from Japan has led to a surge in popularity for yen (JPY) transactions since 2017, Tether made the largest gains in BTC volume. After reaching a high point of about 80% earlier this year, USDT dominance has since fallen to about 60%.

Stablecoins provide a fiat-pegged store of value, without exposing investors to the volatility of the rest of the crypto markets. As the legal waters surrounding Tether and Bitfinex became murkier, new issuers have come onto the scene offering different collateralized assets over the past year.

Gemini (GUSD), Circle (USDC) and Paxos Standard (PAX) were all released in late 2018. eToro and Wirex released a flood of new new stablecoins earlier this year, and TrustToken (TUSD) has launched tokens backed by the Euro and British Pound. There’s even a stablecoin based on other stablecoins.

But despite increasing competition and recurring concerns over its reserves, Tether – which accidentally minted $5bn USDT last weekend – remains popular among investors.

A report published earlier this year showed that none of the other collateralized stablecoins managed to capture much of Tether’s market share during last winter’s decline.

Morgan Stanley’s analysts suggested that the surge in Tether’s popularity came from the relative ease of transactions as well as the minimal costs. Investors can easily trade Tether for other cryptocurrencies, faster and cheaper than they could through a different asset class.

Another advantage comes from Tether’s universal presence in the exchange world, where USDT is traded in nearly every marketplace. Tether has more than 400 trading pairs, according to CoinMarketCap; the runner-up, TrueUSD, has only 165.

Overall more than two-thirds of all reported Bitcoin trades in the past month were made through other cryptocurrencies, up from just over a half during Q4 2018. Since Bitcoin is the most common cryptocurrency for first-time investors, the latest rally is most likely fueled by traders who are already invested, rather than new investors entering the space.

In its “Bitcoin Decrypted” report published on November 1st, Morgan Stanley predicted an increase in Bitcoin transactions against Tether. At the time, analysts suggested this was because most exchanges lacked fiat trading pairs, and those that did charged high transaction fees. USDT was not only more accessible, analysts said, it was also the cheaper option.

It also suggests that large investors remain mostly untroubled by the legal issues surrounding Tether. But there is another possible explanation: many Tether skeptics believe unbacked USDT helped raise Bitcoin prices, which would account for the increase in USDT-BTC trades.

Today’s Morgan Stanley report also provides a breakdown on Facebook’s Libra coin as well as the digital asset market in general. In that report, analysts suggested that IEOs are actually retracements to a more centralized issuance model and that close correlations exist between last year’s Bitcoin rally and the Nasdaq composite during the dotcom boom.

Another key finding highlighted that institutional involvement is increasing, while retail investments have stagnated. If the banks’ analysts are correct, this could be the beginning of more institutional adoption for virtual assets.",2019-07-16 15:32:14+00:00,https://cryptoslate.com/vitalik-buterin-proposes-using-bitcoin-cash-as-ethereums-data-layer/,"The co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, proposed using Bitcoin Cash as a short-term solution for adding a data availability layer to Ethereum. However, Buterin’s proposal was quickly met with heavy criticism, with many pointing out how seriously flawed the idea was.

Ethereum’s search for new scalability solutions

The search for the ultimate scalability solution has led pushed blockchain companies to come up with some extremely innovative ideas. However, some seem to have gone too far in their search, suggesting ideas that would be almost impossible to implement in reality.

That is the case with a possible new Ethereum scalability solution. Suggested by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, the solution would help increase the network’s scalability by offloading much of its usage. While this sounds like a solid idea in theory, what Butalik is actually suggesting is using the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain as Ethereum’s data layer.

Buterin shared his proposal on the ETHResearch forum, saying that Ethereum’s long term scalability plan is going to be Ethereum 2.0. The network’s planned 10 MB/sec data throughput will be much higher than that of any existing blockchain, he said, which would effectively solve most of Ethereum’s scalability problems.

However, until Ethereum 2.0 sees the light of day, Buterin suggested developers started working on other scalability solutions that rely on a non-scalable computation layer combined with a scalable data layer.

Buterin’s Bitcoin Cash suggestion met with criticism

The solution he believes is a “perfect fit” for Ethereum is Bitcoin Cash. Buterin cited BCH’s 32 MB per 600 seconds of data throughput and low fees as two of the biggest reasons why using it as a data layer for Ethereum would be perfect.

According to Buterin, Ethereum already has all the machinery it needs to verify Bitcoin Cash blocks inside of ETH, adding that verifying BCH blocks is much cheaper than verifying Ethereum Classic blocks. Another thing he said turned him towards BCH is the community’s “friendliness” to people using their chain for “whatever they want.”

The main weakness, he said, was BCH’s 10-minute block time, which is unlikely to change in the near future.

But, despite a very ambitious start, both Buterin and his Bitcoin Cash proposal found themselves at the receiving end of heavy criticism. The majority of those ridiculing Buterin’s suggestions seem to be adamantly against any cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, with some saying Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash were helping each other collapse faster.

Some industry heavyweights also spoke on the matter, saying there was an abundance of problems Bitcoin Cash would bring and that a 10-minute block time should be the least of their worries. Andre Neves, the editor of Komenco Blog and Lightwork, said that BCH’s low hashrate and central controlling authorities should be more pressing matters.

Japanese crypto exchange operator Bitpoint pledged to compensate the victims of the recent hack. The company plans to refund about $30 million worth of cryptocurrency.

About 50,000 Clients Affected by the Hack

On Tuesday, Bitpoint published an update on its website, revealing the amounts of stolen crypto. Also, President Genki Oda held a press conference on the same day, apologizing for the situation. He unveiled that about 50,000 Bitpoint users saw their crypto funds stolen.

On Friday, we reported that Bitpoint announced that it had lost 3.5 billion yen worth of cryptocurrency, which is the equivalent of $32 million based on the Friday currency rates. Yesterday, the company said that another $2.3 million worth of crypto missing. The recently discovered missing funds were stolen from exchanges outside Japan, which use Bitpoint’s trading platform.

At the press conference, Bitpoint representatives voiced the company’s intention to reimburse affected clients with $30 million worth of crypto. Interestingly, the exchange plans to return the funds specifically in cryptocurrency rather than in fiat equivalents.

The exchange confirmed that the breach hit its hot wallets only, while the cold wallets stayed untouched. The platform still maintains its services suspended.

Currently, Bitpoint, which is operated by Remixpoint, is collaborating with the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The latter is a self-regulatory cryptocurrency exchange body launched last year. The JVCEA will help Bitpoint implement customer protection standards.

Bitpoint Reveals More Details of Stolen Funds

In the latest report, Bitpoint presented the crypto losses by cryptocurrency. According to the exchange, it had lost the following amounts:

1,225 Bitcoin priced at 15.3 billion yen, out of which 1.28 billion yen were owned by customers;

1,985 Bitcoin Cash worth 70 million yen, out of which 40 million yen belonged to clients;

11,169 Ether valued at 330 million yen, out of which 240 million yen belonged to clients;

5,108 Litecoin worth 0.5 billion yen, out of which 40 million yen belonged to customers.

28,106,343 XRP priced at 10.02 billion yen, out of which 2.6 billion yen belonged to clients.

Thus, Ripple’s XRP accounts for a third of the total loss of 3.02 billion yen. The crypto exchange is reportedly collaborating with the Ripple Foundation as well.

A press release published on July 15 revealed that Coinberry has begun negotiations with the City of Richmond Hill in the Greater Toronto Area. The news comes after the Council voted on July 10 in favor of cementing an agreement with Coinberry to support Bitcoin (BTC) property tax payments for residents and firms in its jurisdiction.

The partnership represents Coinberry’s second municipal foray in less than six months, with the firm previously having implemented a crypto payments service with the Town of Innisfil, also in the Greater Toronto Area.

Coinberry is a Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada-registered firm and has been converting multiple cryptocurrencies into Canadian dollars to settle property tax payments with Innisfil, meaning that the municipality itself does not hold crypto directly. The same solution will presumably be implemented in Richmond Hill.

Once negotiations have been finalized, City of Richmond Hill municipal staff are expected to report back on the likelihood they will be able to implement Coinberry’s technology for additional payments of other City fees and broaden services as soon as September 30.

According to the press release, the Council’s affirmative vote in favor of crypto payments means that the City of Richmond Hill’s City Manager is legally authorized to enter into a contract with Coinberry as soon as negotiations are complete.

In a statement, the municipality’s deputy mayor Joe di Paola indicated that:

""We believe that the demand for a digital currency payment option is only going to grow in the coming years, especially amongst millennials. Our Council was aware of Coinberry's successful implementation of a digital currency payment service with the Town of Innisfil, and since there was no cost and no risk to [...] do the same, it made the decision that much easier for us.""

As previously reported, In the United States, the state of Ohio became the first to authorize businesses to pay taxes using Bitcoin. Businesses are allowed to pay 23 different taxes using the crypto through an online portal that was established by the state treasury office.

Bitcoin closed below $9,614 on Tuesday, confirming a bearish reversal on the daily chart. The invalidation of bullish higher-lows pattern is backed by bearish developments on the short-term charts.

Prices risk falling to $9,097 (May 30 high) in the next 24 hours. A close below that would expose the 100-day moving average line, currently located near $8,100.

A key indicator is reporting oversold conditions as per the 4-hour chart, so a minor bounce before any drop below $9,097 cannot be ruled out.

The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as BTC is holding above the 200-day moving average line.

Bitcoin logged one of the biggest daily price losses of the year on Tuesday, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change in the process.

The world’s biggest cryptocurrency by market value closed (UTC) at $9,412.81 on Bitstamp, down 13.25 percent from the daily opening price of $10,848. That’s the second-largest single-day drop of 2019, the first being the 13.67 percent price slide observed on June 27.

With the drop and the resulting UTC close below the July 2 low of $9,614, BTC has invalidated the most basic of all bullish patterns – the series of higher lows on the daily chart.

Media outlets have associated the recent drop with the growing calls for regulation of Facebook’s Libra project and cryptocurrencies in general.

For instance, Facebook’s plan came under attack at a U.S. hearing on Tuesday, with senators calling the company delusional and untrustworthy and questioning the social media giant on how it was planning to prevent money laundering. And, a week ago, President Donald Trump called for banking regulation on bitcoin and Facebook’s Libra.

Now many in the investor community are beginning to worry that Facebook’s Libra project will end up fast-tracking regulations for the crypto market.

The shift in sentiment will likely have a bearing on bitcoin’s price. After all, the crypto market leader rallied from $9,000 to $13,880 in the eight days following Facebook’s unveiling of Libra’s white paper on June 18.

With the odds now stacked in favor of bitcoin’s bears, the cryptocurrency could suffer a deeper drop in the short-run.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,400 on Bitstamp.

Daily chart

Bitcoin’s invalidation of bullish higher-lows pattern, as represented by Tuesday’s UTC close below $9,615, is backed by a below-50 (bearish) reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs).

Further, prices are trading below the key support of the 50-day MA for the first time since early February.

The Chaikin money flow, which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, is barely holding in positive territory, a sign that buying pressure has weakened significantly over the last three weeks.

So, the stage looks set for a drop to $9,097 (May 30 high). A violation there would expose the 100-day MA, currently at $8,122.

A weekly close above $12,000 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup, as discussed yesterday.

4-hour chart

The RSI on the 4-hour chart is reporting oversold conditions. As a result, BTC may chart a bearish lower high around $10,000 before falling to $9,097 or below.

While short-duration charts are calling a deeper drop, the long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are held above the 200-day MA, currently lined up at $5,983.

It’s worth noting that prominent analysts believe the ongoing price drop is nothing but a correction in a bull market.

“We’ll retrace inside a temporary downtrend”, @pierre_crypt0 tweeted yesterday.

Alex Kruger, a renowned technical and fundamental analyst, also feels the price is drop is a healthy correction.

Given that there are now 15 cryptocurrencies on Coinbase that you can trade, the new features should provide some signals.

In addition to price and variation information, you can see what Coinbase customers with large balances are currently doing. You get a buy/sell percentage for each asset.

Behind the scene, Coinbase looks at users with a Coinbase balance in the top 10% for that asset. The exchange then counts how many users in that pool have increased or decreased their positions over the last 24 hours. The signal is updated every two hours.

Coinbase is also calculating two other data points — the average hold time and the popularity of each asset. This time, the company relies on the entire Coinbase user base to tell you how long people keep a specific asset before selling it or sending it to another address.

Unfortunately, when you transfer your assets to a hardware wallet or a more secure wallet, Coinbase considers that you’re no longer “holding” that asset because it’s no longer on your Coinbase account.

Finally, Coinbase is looking at price data to find out if prices of multiple assets are correlated. For instance, if Crypto X and Crypto Y have a correlation of 0%, it means that they have no relationship. A negative correlation means that two assets move in opposite directions. This feature could help you build a more balanced portfolio of cryptocurrencies.",2019-07-17 00:00:00.000,https://investorplace.com/2019/07/10-best-cryptocurrencies-to-keep-on-your-radar/,10 Best Cryptocurrencies to Keep on Your Radar,2019-07-10 00:00:00.000,https://www.coindesk.com/the-case-7-5k-could-become-bitcoins-new-price-support,"Amidst a decline in the price of bitcoin, the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency could find support at $7,500 – that is if it follows past patterns on the charts.

Bitcoin has faced selling pressure over the last few days, despite an impending golden crossover on the three-day chart – a bullish crossover of the 50- and 200-candle moving averages, as discussed last week. As of writing, the 50-candle moving average (MA) is on an upward trajectory and looks set to cross above the 200-candle MA in the next few days.

It is worth noting, however, that a similar golden crossover on the three-day chart was observed in early February 2016, when a bitcoin bull market was then in its nascent stages.

More importantly, BTC was heavily offered in the run-up to the confirmation of the golden crossover. Prices dropped to the 200-candle MA support days before the bull cross happened and that level was never put to test again, as seen in the chart below.

3-day chart (2015-16)

As seen above, BTC took a beating in six weeks leading up to the golden crossover confirmed on Feb. 3, 2016. Prices topped out at $467 seen in mid-December 2015 and almost tested the 200-candle MA support line of $348 in three days to January 19.

Over the next couple of months, BTC largely traded in the range of $360 to $450 before breaking higher. Essentially, the 200-candle MA served as a base ahead of the golden crossover and the level was never tested again throughout the rally from $450 to $20,000.

Also, it is worth noting that BTC rallied more than 140 percent from the August lows near $200, before topping out above $460 in mid-December.

The price action seen over the last few months looks eerily similar to the one discussed above.

3-day chart (2019)

Placed in recent context, BTC rose to a 17-month high of $13,880 last month. At that level, the cryptocurrency was up nearly 250 percent from lows near $4,000 observed at the end of March.

As of now, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $9,600, representing a 30 percent drop from recent highs. Essentially, the cryptocurrency is losing ground in the run-up to the golden crossover the way it did before the bull cross of February 2016.

If history is a guide, then the ongoing pullback could be extended further to the 200-candle MA, currently flatlined $7,448. Also, prices may bounce back strongly from that level and resume the bull market.

Will history repeat itself?

History is known to repeat itself in financial markets and the bitcoin market is no exception.

The top cryptocurrency now appear to have bottomed out in December 2018 – i.e. a year and a half ahead of the mining reward halving due in May 2020 (reminding the crypto community of the seller exhaustion ahead of the reward halving and that took place in August 2016).

Over the last five months, a number of technical indicators have produced patterns similar to those seen before the onset of the bull market in late 2015.

For instance, the 50- and 100-week moving averages produced a bearish crossover in February – two months before BTC broke into a bull market and two months after the cryptocurrency bottomed out near $3,100. A similar bear cross was observed months before BTC’s bullish breakout of October 2015.

All-in-all, there is a strong case to believe that BTC would drop to the 200-candle MA, currently at $7,448, before the confirmation of the golden crossover on the 3-day chart and then rise back sharply.

The company told reporters in Tokyo on July 16 that customers will receive refunds of crypto on a 1:1 basis, The Asahi Shimbun reports Wednesday.

The company’s latest estimate of losses from the security breach comes to around 3.02 billion yen ($28 million) – roughly $4.6 million less than originally thought, the report says.

The thousands of exchange customers are said to have lost 2.06 billion yen ($20 million) in the breach, with the firm saying that it has new prepared that amount in crypto assets for reimbursement. That will occur once the platform has restarted its services, which were halted when the hack was spotted.

Making an apology for the incident, BITPoint president Genki Oda said that the exchange is investigating the cause of the hack, but apparently offered no further detail.

In a post published on Tuesday, the company confirmed that the crypto assets stolen in the July 12 hack included 1,225 bitcoin, 1,985 bitcoin cash, 11,169 ether, and 5,108 litecoin.

When asked if by refunding users in crypto and not cash they might lose out due to recent price drops, BITpoint’s director, Kimio Mikazuki, refused to answer “as it includes legal matters,” the report indicates.

For the uninitiated, voluntaryism is a philosophy based on consent. In the simplest terms it says: “If it’s not voluntary, it’s not moral.” This basic statement is often countered with “Yes, but not everyone agrees on that, some people use violence to get what they want.” This is 100% true. And this is why voluntaryists are not pacifists, but believe in and support self-defense. Self-defense as per voluntaryism is defined as protecting one’s property, which begins with the self. As such, the philosophy and its adherents have taken a remarkable interest in bitcoin, thanks to the non-violent nature of peer-to-peer, decentralized currency.

Individual Self-Ownership

The central axiom of voluntaryism is individual self-ownership. What this means simply is that an individual’s body is their own, and the bodies of others are not theirs to coerce or control via violence or threats of violence. While this sounds like a given for any moral society, common practices and ideas in current culture and society such as taxation, democracy, and authoritarianism in general are incompatible. They are incompatible because they are based on violations of property, which is the definition of violence as per the philosophy.

What Is Property?

Voluntaryist conceptions of property are arrived at via the individual. As the individual’s body and life is his or her own (individual self-ownership), by extension, those previously unowned resources which they acquire via their body’s labor become their property. If there is an unowned apple tree in a meadow, the man who picks an apple from the tree has now appropriated the fruit. In the case where there is a dispute about the tree itself, laws of property—and not arbitrary assertions of authority—decide the rightful owner.

Let’s say two people in the above scenario disagree, and both claim ownership of the apple tree. They have a few choices. They can “duke it out” and attack one another physically for dominance based on arbitrary assertion. “It’s mine because I say so!” They can alternately work out some system voluntarily by which to share the tree and its fruit. Realistically, however, this does not always happen. The third option is to determine who—if anyone—is the tree’s proper owner. “Proper” being itself related to “property.”

Determination of Ownership

Perhaps individual A in this scenario makes a more direct, objective link claim. “The tree was my father’s. He planted it and gave it to me when he died.” In this case the property legitimately acquired via the father’s body has been gifted to the son by his will. Party B has no say over the disposal of the tree, as property is defined as an exclusive use right.

In another scenario, party B might make the claim that the tree is part of his homestead. He fenced it in years ago and there was no one living around there at the time, or no protests if there were. He came upon the tree first, and claimed it. In yet another context a party C might be present to help resolve the conflict, as resorting to the initiation of physical force always comes with societal and economic consequences.

The Price of Violent Conflict

Should individual A and individual B resort to fisticuffs for ownership of the tree, several serious costs are incurred. First, if there are no other parties in the area, individual A killing or maiming B for the tree will not be beneficial to him. Apart from losing some company in the wilderness, A also loses any hope of market cooperation with B, and their aggregated power to secure and manage resources is diminished. Perhaps B is an excellent marksman and a skilled hunter. Physically attacking B could result in no more deer jerky or meat supplies from A. In this way, cooperation is advantageous to both A and B as self-interested individuals, completely absent of any ideas about “selflessness” or altruism.

The Current Situation (Euphemized Theft)

This simple illustration can be compounded, multiplied, or made infinitely more complex without changing or disproving the foundational ethics or functional logic beneath. In today’s world, small groups of individuals called “presidents,” “governments,” “prime ministers,” and “kings and queens,” have claimed ownership of vast swathes of property and resources—including the bodies of others—willy-nilly. There’s no connection to their bodies. No connection to self-ownership. And though “individual self-ownership” may be semantically critiqued, the natural reality is concrete, objective, and immutable. Only I can move my hands or blink my eyes via direct biological connection to my brain. No one can achieve this more directly than I can. In a sense, this is “nature’s design.”

The rulers of the world today claim ownership over the bodies of others via taxation. They demand a percentage of the income earned through the labor of the bodies of others under threat of violence. “Taxation” as such is merely a euphemism for extortion. On a one-to-one level (try it with your friends and see if they’re fine with it) this is called slavery. On a governmental level, it is illogically euphemized as “the price we pay to live in a civilized society.” The literal gangs called “governments” today claim land and resources, killing or caging any who challenge them, apropos of nothing more than the antiquated idea of “divine right to rule.”

Universalization, Bitcoin, and Beyond

While objective morality is hotly contested, it is an unnecessary debate insofar as voluntaryism is concerned. The question is simple: does one value minimal violence? If one values the minimization of potential violence in a given society, it is empirically demonstrable that a non-universalizable norm like “kings and queens” (everybody cannot be king or queen) will always potentiate violent conflict over resources and influence. This is reliable as gravity. There must be a grundnorm for working out differences, which every individual (the smallest minority in any society) can exercise with equal potential clout.

Bitcoin and other peer-to-peer electronic payment systems have opened new doors for voluntaryists to transact peacefully. Where the fiat (“by decree”) money systems of governments worldwide rely on violence—”Use this money or we’ll physically harm or threaten you”—bitcoin relies on consent. Users are free to not surrender their value to bullies or violent parties, as the “bully” has no control over the mathematics which govern the system. This math, like individual self-ownership, is a naturally occurring, decentralized, objectively provable phenomenon. Voluntaryists prefer decentralized order as opposed to centralized, violent governance. This makes bitcoin and crypto a good fit.

Answering Common Objections

There are plenty of objections to the use of bitcoin. Some think it is a deep state co-opt created as a long-game takeover of the world monetary system. A conspiracy to exit cash. Some view not paying taxes and a lack of centralized oversight as criminal and dangerous. Objections to the ideas of voluntaryism are in no short supply, either. “It’s utopian! People are generally violent and selfish!”

Regardless of personal opinion, the facts remain: bitcoin and crypto (technology) facilitate direct, consensual P2P transaction. Claiming a bitcoin user must be “supervised” with violence or forced to pay for something, is a violation of their self-ownership and natural human autonomy. Claiming that people are corrupt, so voluntaryism “cannot work” is a self-detonating position, logically. If indeed most people are evil, the worst idea ever would be to have a centralized power structure composed of these very same people.

Massive criminal gangs have already taken over; one just needs to read the news every day. They’re called governments. Roads are already built by private companies all over the world. Breathtakingly complex webs of voluntary legal agreements hold together the modern economies of nations worldwide. Legions of individuals interact and transact peacefully every day, not because of a powerful police presence, or regulation, but because where highly self-interested individuals valuing peace are concerned, property norms, free trade, and strong social connections are infinitely preferable to superstitions about kings and queens backed by unthinkable brutality and violence.

For the past two years, Dennis Kadengu has been buying as much cryptocurrency as he can afford. He uses bitcoin to buy and sell online, which he can't do with Zimbabwe's currency as it is worthless outside the country.

""Bitcoin, I think, is the most safest cryptocurrency, and in terms of safety, you can have a large amount of money in equivalent to U.S. dollars or euros, having it on your person, moving it around even in seconds which is very beneficial rather than carrying a large bag of U.S. dollars on person,"" Kadengu said.

Cryptocurrency traders say their business got a boost in June when authorities banned the use of foreign currencies and reissued the Zimbabwe dollar. The currency was abandoned in 2009 after inflation estimated at 500 billion percent made it worthless.

Last month, Zimbabwe's inflation rate rose to 175 percent, raising fears that the days of hyperinflation are on their way back.

Confidence Nyirenda, director of Golix Crypto Exchange, has seen benefits for business.

""So, we have seen a lot of people coming to us saying, 'l want to move X amount of money' or 'l want to purchase a car in Japan,' stuff like that, and we are accommodating them. So, it's really a huge advantage to our side and l think also it will enhance our business in the long run,"" Nyirenda said.

""The major issues that they had with the use of bitcoins and cryptocurrencies were people getting scammed and also had the fear of money being laundered through bitcoins,"" Nyirenda said.

The president’s off-the-cuff comments have served a wide variety of purposes, from enriching political discourse with the mysterious term covfefe to delivering direct threats — furnished with proper capitalization — to the leadership of the nations deemed U.S. adversaries. The most newsworthy rants almost invariably felt improvised, emotional and reactive. However, the historic series of tweets that constituted the first-ever public comment on cryptocurrencies by a sitting U.S. president didn’t seem to fit the same mold.

If anything, the three-prong statement comes across as consistent, strategically timed and unusually well-articulated. It opens with a general critique of cryptocurrencies, then proceeds to extend the punch to Libra, Facebook’s much-discussed prospective digital currency, and concludes with a feel-good declaration lauding the U.S. dollar as the “most dominant currency anywhere in the World.”

The statement, seemingly uncalled for, came days before Libra’s chief, David Marcus, was slated to face Congress in two back-to-back hearings. Earlier on the day, when cryptocurrencies incurred President Trump’s wrath, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve’s chair, admitted before the Senate Banking Committee that a globally entrenched cryptocurrency could potentially render existing reserve currencies obsolete.

Finally, four days after Trump’s tweets, Treasury Secretary Steven Muchin echoed the president’s concerns almost verbatim during a press conference during which he contended that cryptocurrencies posed a “national security threat.” At that point, it became difficult not to see the messages coming out of the administration as a coordinated viewpoint.

It is no surprise many in the crypto community came to suspect that the tweets were not Trump’s own. Preston Byrne, a pro-Trump blockchain lawyer, was among the president’s supporters who expressed doubts over the message’s authorship, adding, “This is more likely coming from the Treasury Department — that’d be Secretary Mnuchin — and at the behest in particular of the banks.” The Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto questioned Trump’s understanding of the subject matter altogether, “I do not believe for an instant that the president could define a cryptocurrency, explain what bitcoin is, or even know what Libra (much less its Association) is supposed to be.”

Immediate response

Whoever had penned the tweets, cryptocurrency prices took a tumble immediately, then bounced upward briefly before entering an even greater hit, flashing red signals all across the market. Although some analysts claimed that it was not President Trump’s remarks that had triggered the reversal, both the timing and steepness of the decline correspond to what one could interpret as a sell-off in the wake of major negative news.

Despite the immediate market dynamics in the aftermath of the tweetstorm, the spirits of many opinion leaders were high. The common theme was that, regardless of the valence of the presidential statement, the sheer fact of mention is a strategic win for the blockchain industry, as more than 60 million of Trump’s followers have become aware of the cryptocurrencies’ existence. Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of financial services company Circle, called the development “possibly the largest bull signal for BTC ever” while Forbes’ Billy Bambrough observed that Trump “has inadvertently catapulted bitcoin and cryptocurrencies into a presidential issue and given valuable recognition to the burgeoning bitcoin technology.”

In the short run, though, such a negative introduction could well damage cryptocurrencies’ standing with millions of Americans. Many industry stalwarts, such as Caitlin Long and John McAfee, urged the president to further educate himself on the issue before making strong statements. Nigel Green, the founder and CEO of deVere Group, remarked that discarding digital currencies in the advent of the digital era is a questionable way to go.

Unsurprisingly, the anti-Bitcoin rant cost Trump support of some of his former allies among crypto-loving libertarians and right-wingers. Gab, a social medium notorious for becoming a haven for public figures exiled from more mainstream platforms for the extremity of viewpoints they expressed, tweeted back at the president their defense of Bitcoin as “free speech money.” It remains unknown if President Trump is aware of the existence of this brand of his supporters, maybe someone crypto-friendly who has his ear — e.g., Mick Mulvaney had tipped him off. Yet, it doesn’t seem likely that the president would sacrifice his strategic financial policy messaging in order to make such niche groups feel good.

The importance of “thin air”

Beyond taking issue with the fact of the president’s arguably uninformed criticism, the substance of his claims deserves a thorough rebuttal as well. Granted, there has been no shortage of thoughtful deconstructions offered by the blockchain industry in the days right after Trump’s tweets and his account erupted with the anti-crypto rant.

For sure, as the person with so much influence over the dollar, a sitting U.S. president is in no position to express any kind of public endorsement of what could potentially threaten the dollar’s hegemony as a medium of exchange and a reserve currency. However, the kind of shallow criticism that President Trump offered doesn’t hold any water when faced with any systematic counterargument. Such an outburst does little to advance a much-needed and nuanced conversation about how the incumbent financial system would be reconciled with the emerging realm of crypto finance.

Trump argued that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not money, as their value is “highly volatile and based on thin air.” Perhaps this is accurate for those who espouse the very narrow (and rather antiquated) definition of money as a unit of value issued by a central government and backed by a nation state’s economy. But it is 2019, and many prominent thinkers adhere to more flexible and broad definitions, which is something to contend with.

In a post for The Merkle, George McDonaugh rightfully observed that what is money and what is not is highly context-dependent, saying “Cigarettes are money in prisons, bullets are money in war zones and bitcoin is money in Venezuela.” Borderless and globally priced, Bitcoin can be money in many ways fiat currencies are not, if given a chance.

Further still, the global reserve currency status is context-dependent as well. As the Western powers butchered each other into poverty and devastation during two world wars, the United States came out on top as the world’s most powerful economy, propelling the dollar to the status of global reserve currency along the way. This is the context, and the context is always subject to change. The value of both USD and Bitcoin is based on trust — they just go about it differently. In many ways, algorithmically maintained trust looks superior to the fragile assumptions that underlie the financial system powered by a $22 trillion debt.

Now, facilitation of crime. The tale is so rusty that, for many crypto aficionados, it has become difficult to go on yet another round of debunking it without rolling their eyes. McAfee chose a classic way to retort: It is true that Bitcoin gave a certain edge to villains for a short time, but so did every consequential invention in history, including, for example, the telephone. As of today, the track record of U.S. law enforcement agencies picking criminals’ traces off blockchains is already impressive, and there is no reason to expect that a future regulation-compliant decentralized digital asset would be any different in this regard.

As The Next Web’s Yessi Bello Perez reminded, most cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous, while cash is anonymous — guess which one is better suited for illicit activities by design? Moreover, when cash is no longer around, centrally issued currencies will surely facilitate financial surveillance of an unprecedented scale, as Coin Center’s Neeraj K. Agrawal aptly pointed out.

All in all, while it is hard to expect anything else than a firm no-coin stance from a public servant tasked with overseeing the U.S. national currency, the set of arguments that Donald Trump recently advanced have several pronounced gaps to take a dig at. Moreover, the ever-expanding blockchain-based financial system is not going anywhere as a result of Trump’s tweets. It will remain right there, close behind the traditional institutions, waiting for The Donald or the next U.S. leader to address it in earnest.",,https://www.coindesk.com/japan-has-fatf-green-light-to-create-swift-network-for-crypto-report,"Japan is said to be leading the creation of an international cryptocurrency payments network similar to banking network SWIFT.

A report from Reuters on Thursday cites a source familiar with the effort as saying that the network is aimed to combat money laundering and was approved last month by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

A team from the international money laundering task force would monitor development of the project, which will be conducted alongside other nations, the source said.

The network is an initiative from Japan’s Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency (FSA) watchdog. Reuters said both agencies would not comment when contacted.

Japan had been more closely scrutinizing crypto exchanges as the host of a June meeting by the G20 group of nations, and also launched a working group to discuss regulatory issues around Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency prior to the G7 meeting last week.

The nation has suffered a number of notable hacks of crypto exchanges, including two of the world’s biggest and most shocking: Mt. Gox and Coincheck.

Largely as a result of the Gox breach, Japan has been one of thee most proactive countries when it comes to regulation of cryptos. In 2017, it created a licensing scheme for exchanges and amended its financial rules to allow bitcoin as a legal payment method.

Bitcoinist Senior Analyst, FilbFilb, believes that the basic rule of supply and demand will prevent Bitcoin from dropping to a new 2019 low.

FUD to Drive Bitcoin to a New Bottom?

Bitcoin’s most recent price action has presented a plethora of challenges to cryptocurrency traders, and the drop below $10,000 has the most bearish traders calling for Bitcoin to revisit the $5,000 – $7,500 range. While theories abound, a popular explanation is fear spun up by Facebook’s Libra hearing with the U.S. Senate Banking Committee combined with bearish technical factors are pushing Bitcoin price lower.

Renowned crypto-analyst FilbFilb recently posted a detailed Twitter thread wherein he makes an argument for why BTC price will not come anywhere near to its previous bottom of $3,120. According to FilbFilb and Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin price will stay above the cost of mining as miners must remain profitable.

…the price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost.”

Supply & Demand

Essentially, the basic rules of supply and demand will dictate Bitcoin price and in January analysts at JP Morgan Chase found that the extraction cost of mining a single bitcoin averaged $4,060 in Q4, 2018. Comparing this average against the current Bitcoin price shows that miners are still bagging a profit of about $5,500 per Bitcoin.

FilbFilb suggests that miners will sell into market demand whenever the revenue per BTC rises above mining costs but will also “limit selling [as Bitcoin’s] pre-halving event approaches to invoke the new halving bubble”.

FilbFilb elaborated by saying:

What happened in 2018 was miners selling off their Bitcoins at marginal costs. Only the most efficient miners survived, while their inefficient competitors got eliminated.”

FilbFilb is of the opinion that miners are now holding on to their newly minted bitcoins in anticipation of the 2020 halving event. If history is a guide, then we should see miners begin to limit sales as they wait for prices to explode on the approach of the halving event, then sell as selling pressure begins to diminish.

Bitcoin vs the Government

Bitcoin’s most recent precipitous drop and FilbFilb’s commentary come after a two day US Senate Banking Committee meeting with Facebook to discuss the intricacies of their Libra project. Bitcoin price could also be influenced by recent comments from US President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

Each cautioned the public and regulators about the potential for cryptocurrency to facilitate organized criminal and terrorist activity. Mnuchin even went so far as to label cryptocurrency “a national security threat.” It’s possible that BTC buyers have taken a pause over fears that the Trump administration could levy some sort of partial ban or stringent regulation on the growing crypto sector.

In the long-run, the current pullback is probably nothing more than a mere temporary blip and the majority of BTC investors maintain a bullish view for the sector. One must remember that institutional investors like Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade, E*Trade and the Intercontinental Exchange have all openly stated their intentions to provide institutional and eventually retail digital asset services to clients.

The price of bitcoin (BTC) jumped by more than $1,000 in the expanse of 30 minutes yesterday, with the rest of the market following suit, rising between 5-20 percent, while Litecoin (LTC) outperformed all other top 10 crypto by market capitalization.

LTC is up 13 percent over a 24-hour period and is currently changing hands just above the $100 resistance at $100.72.

Top 10 at CoinMarketCap

For now, the broader markets are flashing green, a welcome sight for the bulls who managed to stem the bleeding across the board with BTC defending a key area above $9,000 at 11:00 UTC yesterday morning.

As a result names such as EOS, Binance Coin (BNB), Ether (ETH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) are up between 7-12 percent respectively. Litecoin has been most involved with the rebound rally and is leading the pack by an extra 1.02 percentage points.

Hourly chart

As can be seen in the hourly chart above, LTC has resumed its previous price action, witnessed July 11 to July 14, which shows a rough $8 consolidation range.

Consolidation is the term for an asset or stock that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated assets or stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until a clear pattern emerges.

For now crypto traders can enjoy the temporary stop-gap offered from periods of consolidation to consider their next move as money continues to flow in and out of the markets.

Morning Markets: Let’s talk about three things that are happening now in the world of private companies.

We’ll have some coverage out shortly regarding the newest mega-rounds, but I wanted to bring up a few newsy items not directly related to raising money this morning.

First, the latest from Postmates, a company that is in the process of going public. Second, a note on what we’ve been watching in the crypto space. And, finally, a question regarding which private companies will report partial results regarding their second-quarter performance.

Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily

The first will help us understand the IPO market, the second will help us grok what’s going on with crypto-related startups, and the final issue could help shape how we view which decacorns are ready to go public. Let’s go!

The Postmates IPO

Yesterday at a Fortune event, Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann made a few comments on his company’s IPO process, and rumors concerning a possible sale of the company. (He was also on stage to talk about the company’s wheeled delivery vehicles.) Asked about going public, he said while he couldn’t comment, he would “love to take Postmates public.”

The answer was unsurprising given that Postmates has filed to go public. But when asked about articles noting that his company might sell to a rival, Lehmann had several interesting things to say. First, that his company is “growing twice as fast as Uber Eats, as GrubHub.” Pinning down what “growth” means won’t be easy (revenue? order volume?), but the claim that the delivery-focused service is growing more quickly than larger, more valuable rivals is notable.

Lehmann also said that “if you take the necessary steps to prepare your company to go public you will get inbound” interest. This rings true, as we’ve seen some high-profile acquisition deals land right before some IPOs in recent years; it isn’t clear if Postmates is as healthy as AppDynamics was before it was snapped up on the eve of its public offering, but that Postmates is answering the phone, instead of making calls matters.

Regarding what to do with possible deals, Lehmann said that his company always takes a “look” at such interest, and then makes “the smart decision.”

Summarizing, the Postmates IPO is still on provided that a larger company isn’t willing to cut an outsized check to snap up Postmates. At least that’s the sentiment that Lehmann was hoping to cultivate. Regardless, let’s see the S-1.

Crypto: Up And Down

After an up year (2017) and a down year (2018), the world of cryptocurrencies was quiet in early 2019, before bitcoin and other popular blockchain-based products saw their prices quickly appreciate this summer. The value of a single bitcoin pierced the $13,000 mark before falling back under $10,000.

If you aren’t into watching the cryptocurrency markets around the clock (shame on you if you aren’t; shame on you if you are) you’ve missed the latest action. But don’t worry, I don’t think there’s too much you have to retain from the recent appreciation in crypto-assets. Really you just need to know two things:

When bitcoin’s price rises, it drives media interest, and mass-market attention. Bitcoin’s highest trading volumes come when it appreciates, along with spikes in search engine interest and the like. Thus, bitcoin appreciating is good for companies who work in the cryptocurrency space. Firms like Coinbase, for example, who provide a consumer-friendly onramp into the world of crypto and make money on the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s dominance among cryptocurrencies is growing once again. In the earlier days of the blockchain boom, bitcoin’s value was over 80 percent of the value of all crypto assets. That fell into the 30s in early 2018. Today the percentage is back to 65. This means that smaller coins are struggling once again and that the link between the value of bitcoin, and other similar products, could be loosening.

And with that, you can go back to not caring about bitcoin.

WeWork, And Who Else?

Now that the third quarter is underway, the public markets are gearing up for earnings season. For us covering the private markets, it’s usually a period of watching and not participating much. But in recent quarters, some private companies have taken on the mantle of public shops, at least when it comes to regular disbursements of financial data relating to their recent performance.

Uber started doing this ages ago, and Lyft took part in the game as well before going public. WeWork also reports some performance. What do these companies have in common? They were (are, in the case of WeWork) some of the most valuable startups ever put together.

It seems that private companies worth $10 billion or more are disclosing information normally kept under wraps while they await going public. You can imagine why this is becoming more common. By sharing the information they want, decacorns can control their public narrative by disclosing their best figures. And, what better way to combat leaks than to disclose the information yourself in the manner of your choosing?

Also, regular reports of good performance could diminish calls for short-term liquidity from existing shareholders. A good report must renew faith among the shareholding. Of course, there are the normal risks that come from such disclosures, including providing asymmetrical information to yet-private competitors, and the chance that your results aren’t as good as you think, leading to ridicule.

Regardless of the fears, companies are doing this, and I want to encourage it. Which brings us to our final point of the morning. Namely, which company is next? I suspect we’ll see fresh Q2 numbers from WeWork in the next few weeks (here’s our take on its Q1 figures), but what company is the next to begin releasing earnings before going public? Airbnb?

Whichever firm it is, please know that I love email.

It will never happen. My opinion hasn’t changed since bitcoin first hit the market in 2009. People will play with it, some businesses will accept it, fortunes will be made and lost, but it isn’t a threat to any nation’s fiat currency on that level.

People lack trust in even the most established cryptocurrencies. Here’s why.

Cryptocurrencies are hacked too much

Cryptocurrencies are still being hacked to death. Blockchain in theory is nearly unhackable. In practice, not so much. Cryptocurrencies are built on software, and software always, always has bugs. Hackers have found some of those bugs and stolen millions of dollars.

That said, the underlying blockchain implementation is the least of traders’ worries. Hundreds of millions of dollars are still being stolen from exchanges and customer’s cryptocurrency wallets. Computers and digital devices are very hackable. That’s not going to change anytime soon.

Yes, money is stolen from VISA and bank accounts, but the stolen money is usually replaced so little financial harm is done. Even if the money is not replaced, law enforcement agencies and governments respect the value stolen enough that it’s treated like a real crime. Good luck with filing a theft report for your stolen cryptocurrency and trying to get it back. If getting back real stolen money is hard, it almost never happens with stolen cryptocurrency. Worse yet, with most cryptocurrencies you can see which node has taken the money and you still can’t do anything about it.

Most cryptocurrency trading activity is fake

Ninety-five percent of bitcoin trading is fake activity called “wash trading”, which is illegal in every real market. Even with most of it being fake, it’s not being traded at anywhere near the levels of any other real currency. Exchanges are dropping bitcoin, not adding it.

Cryptocurrency is too volatile

A single day can have 20% and bigger shifts in value. Yes, some foreign currencies have the same issue, but no one wants to use them. The fact that receivers almost always convert their cryptocurrencies to real world currencies tells you that even the hardcore supporters don’t trust cryptocurrencies in the long run. Those who keep a significant amount of value in cryptocurrencies are simply timing the cryptocurrency vs. fiat markets to maximize the value of the exchange. That’s not trust. That’s greed.

If the issues around trust and security don’t deter you from trading cryptocurrencies, then consider these points, too:

Cryptocurrencies are expensive to use

After claims of pseudo-anonymity and lack of centralized control, the most desired trait of a cryptocurrency is its supposedly cheap cost to use. Proponents claim you can send money to anyone anywhere without paying any exorbitant fees. Yeah, let me know when that happens. You may be able to send cryptocurrency to another cryptocurrency user for a relatively low cost, but the cost of getting that money into or out of the system (which is how it almost always occurs for most transactions) can cost $5 to $15 per transaction.

In comparison, when I buy something within my country using my credit card, it’s low to zero cost and I can convert to real cash for the same. I’ve bought dozens of items from foreign countries using credit cards the last few years and the most expensive foreign transaction fee I’ve paid is $0.85.

Laws, regulations and taxation

Many people pin their cryptocurrency dreams on an imaginary utopia where cryptocurrencies allow people to transmit value without any interference from laws, regulations and taxes. I can send money from America to Tehran without having to worry about export regulations and fees. How quaint!

There is absolutely zero chance that any long-term, popular currency will get away from taxes and regulation. The crypto-billionaire Winklevoss twins understand this. The world’s governments understand this. There is no way that the world’s governing bodies are going to let any cryptocurrency grow and be used without regulation. Each nation will have its own set of laws, regulations, taxes and fees. If there’s money to be made, it will be regulated and taxed. Welcome to the real world.

If the world can’t regulate and tax it, they will block it. It’s that simple. No supposedly fantastic, pseudo-anonymizing software system is going to be able to get around that fact.

No competitive blockers

The thousands of cryptocurrencies all live in bitcoin’s shadow. It seems everyone is trying to come up with a cryptocurrency solution better than bitcoin, and it’s easy to do. There is no competitive blocker that prevents any other person from creating a cryptocurrency that does exactly what your cryptocurrency does. Facebook’s Libra may have an edge because it can push it on its existing 2 billon-plus user base, but 10 other companies with over a billion users are trying to do the same thing. You’ve got entire countries with billions of people trying to do the same thing. None of them will be more popular than real money. Why? See above.

This not to say that some financial instrument of value won’t become what we or a marketer in the future calls a cryptocurrency. It won’t be totally secure, unregulated, untaxed, anonymous, or distributed. Whatever the winning cryptocurrency is it will look a lot more like VISA than bitcoin.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-says-cash-is-not-laundered-as-much-as-bitcoin-is,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the authority will be preventing Bitcoin (BTC) from becoming an “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.”

U.S. secretary of the treasury to closely monitor Bitcoin regardless of price

In a press briefing reported by CNBC on July 18, Mnuchin criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as they can be used for illicit purposes such as money laundering, adding that the department intends to enforce strong regulations on the space.

The official emphasized his own intent to closely monitor Bitcoin to prevent illegal activity regardless of its price, claiming that there are billions of dollars in Bitcoin and other crypto for nefarious activities.

Mnuchin believes that cash is not laundered like Bitcoin is

As Mnuchin clearly said that Bitcoin’s vulnerability to money laundering is the main reason for the Treasury to regulate it tightly, CNBC’s host Joe Kernen questioned his point in an interview on Squawk Box on July 18.

Kernen argued that Bitcoin and other existing currencies’ capabilities to be used for nefarious activities cannot be a reason for banning them, noting that “cash is laundered all the time.” Mnuchin did not back off from his position, replying that such a statement is not accurate.

The Secretary elaborated that the U.S. has the strongest anti-money laundering (AML) system in the world, adding that the government combats “bad actors in the U.S. dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system.”

Following the interview, Kernen expressed sarcasm about Mnuchin’s idea that cash has not been laundered all the time, but the authorities are combating illicit activities in its system. He tweeted:

“‘The existing system has never been used for illicit activities but we're going to make sure crypto is isn't used for illicit activities like the current system.’ Got it.”

On July 15, Mnuchin expressed concern over Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency and its potential illicit use, noting that he is not comfortable with Libra cryptocurrency, which can be used for tax evasion, extortion, illicit drugs and human trafficking, among others.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ex-microsoft-employee-arrested-for-10-million-crypto-theft,"A former employee at Microsoft has been arrested for a scheme to steal $10 million in cryptocurrency, the Associated Press (AP) reported on July 17.

Insider schemes

The man — a 25-year old Ukrainian national, Volodymyr Kvashuk, allegedly used the ill-gotten proceeds to buy a $160,000 Tesla car and a $1.7 million lakefront home. During the seven months of his scheme, $2.8 million was found to have been transferred into his bank accounts.

Specifically, Kvashuk is accused of having stolen cryptocurrency gift cards that were redeemable against Microsoft products and then reselling them at a profit on the web.

Kvashuk’s attorney did not reportedly answer AP’s request for comment.

In the earlier part of 2019, altcoins seemed to be performing strongly, with many calling the trend “altseason.”

However, since Bitcoin began its 2019 charge starting with the “April Fool’s day rally,” most altcoins seem to be slipping when compared to the top-ranked cryptocurrency. There is now a growing debate about whether the altcoin market will experience the same massive price gains seen in Bitcoin during this current bullish cycle. Within this expanding debate, there are several viewpoints. Some say Bitcoin’s dominance will continue to increase while altcoins continually lose ground. Others posit that previous cycles have seen altcoin rallies coming after bullish fatigue sets in for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin dominance chart as percentage of total market capitalization

Whether altseason returns or not, the only point for consonance appears to be the idea that the current bull cycle could have profound ramifications for the still infant market. Several commentators say cryptos are becoming a more mature asset class, which could lead to wider adoption.

Bitcoin vs. altcoins: The altcoin bubble argument

In late 2017, the cryptocurrency market arguably captured attention in the financial sector and beyond. Bitcoin rose to almost eclipse the $20,000 price mark while altcoins also posted all-time highs. The following year, many cryptocurrencies saw these gains virtually wiped out as the market endured a prolonged bear decline. The average price dip across the board was more than 80%.

Many analytical autopsies of the 2017 bull run converge at the conclusion that the sharp price gains were likely fuelled by hype-driven mania for cryptos as a new asset class. Retail investors struck with a fear of missing out (FOMO) rushed to put money into any and all crypto tokens in the hopes of becoming early backers of the “next Bitcoin.”

This FOMO-driven hype occasioned by the initial coin offering (ICO) boom also generated sufficient tailwind for Bitcoin to reach its all-time price high in mid-December 2017. ICO tokens generated a lot of buzz for the altcoin market as well. While the 2018 bear market did not discriminate in its wipeout of the 2017 price gains, the 2019 recovery hasn’t been as widespread across the market. To get a clearer picture of the situation, consider the following comparison by Twitter user and cryptocurrency analyst StopAndDecrypt:

Since the hard fork that resulted in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) forming a separate chain, BCH has declined by 11% while BTC is up more than 270%.

Bitcoin SV (BSV), the result of the 2018 Bitcoin Cash hash war, has plummeted by more than 40% since the chain split.

While BTC is almost triple its price since the 2017 hard fork, Ether (ETH) has made approximately zero percentage gains within that period.

Altcoins are also down by more than 80% since the peak of altseason.

There is also another means by which to observe Bitcoin’s increasing dominance over altcoin species. This method requires using the BTC price as the baseline for measuring altcoin price-performance within a specific time period, and the results appear even more dire for altcoins.

Take the ETH/BTC pair, for example, which is down to its lowest ratio. Take United States dollar valuations away and the altcoin performance becomes a tale of declining value.

Twitter user and Blockstream developer named Grubles, tweeting on Monday (July 16, 2019), delivered a damning indictment on altcoin value proposition, declaring:

“’Altseason’ was just a flash in the pan caused by Bitcoin miners delaying a protocol upgrade and massively profiting from altcoin mining. We’re now returning to 2013 where alts are effectively unused bad jokes like BBQCoin or PPCoin.”

Altseason and the concept of value in a maturing digital asset space

It is mid-2019 and there are hardly any updates from the ICO projects that raised millions of dollars back in 2017. The story for many of these startups can be distilled into the following points.

Riding on the “cryptomania” hype of 2017, promising a blockchain-based infrastructure that will solve a particular problem — both real and contrived.

Raising millions of dollars from a token sale that most probably was an illegal sale of unregulated securities.

Hiring employees to build the blockchain-based project that ultimately failed to materialize even after extensive marketing runs.

Getting clobbered by the 2018 bear market that rendered their tokens worthless.

Quietly exiting the scene, hoping that no one would notice.

In a private correspondence with Cointelegraph, John Meyer, a managing partner at Starship Capital, provided some commentary on the evolving value proposition narrative in the emerging altcoin landscape stating:

“Most altcoins provide little-to-no tangible value or real-world use. Expect these altcoins to evaporate in short order. However, there is tremendous user-driven momentum in cryptocurrencies that are providing real-world utility on blockchains with tangible value on key industries around the world.”

For crypto bulls like John McAfee, the altcoin market isn’t dead in the water and the current price slide only represents an opportunity for savvy investors to reap the rewards of another altcoin boom having earned returns from Bitcoin’s bullish advance.

McAfee’s bullish altcoin forecasts appear tilted toward privacy coins and medical coins. In multiple tweets published in 2019 alone, the cybersecurity expert and crypto loudmouth has predicted a coming resurgence in the price of these altcoin variants before the end of 2019.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, global blockchain penetration in the health care sector is expected to reach $1.7 billion by 2026, based on findings released by Acumen Research and Consulting.

McAfee even clashed with veteran trader Peter Brandt earlier in July 2019 on the issue of altcoins regaining a foothold in the market. At the time, Brandt sounded a literal death knell for altcoins, but McAfee disagreed in a tweet, saying:

“@PeterLBrandt says altcoins are done. His knowledge is Stone Age. Bitcoin will forever be a store of value, but each transaction allows both parties to see inside their wallets ever after. If banks did this you would scream. Privacy coins don't have this flaw. Just one example.”

Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors also shares similar sentiments with McAfee, stating on multiple occasions that altseason will make a reappearance once BTC reaches a new all-time high. Many of these positive predictions for altcoins appear rooted in historical precedents. However, there is a growing consensus within the industry that the market has evolved since the last bull run in 2017.

In an email to Cointelegraph, Igor Chugunov, CEO of Credits — a blockchain startup that focuses on decentralized apps (DApps) development — argued that altseason will return, commenting:

“The bubble didn’t burst, it is better to say that it is just starting to inflate. The formation of the fundamental components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem is underway, the ICO era and the time when cryptocurrency could be considered as a tool for quick earnings have passed. I can say with confidence that the altcoin season will begin together with the adoption of technology, it is the technology that will determine the future liquidity of the market of altcoins and the general vector of market development. The future season of altcoins won't cover the whole list of altcoins, it will be related to the coins that present definite value for space.”

Is the fated “cryptocalypse” at hand?

Holding BTC over the last 365 days (as at press time) would mean a 62% gain. However, for the top-10 altcoins in mid-July 2019, the situation is the polar opposite. Of these top-10 altcoins from a year ago, only Litecoin (LTC) has a percentage decline below 50%. Iota suffered the most, dropping more than 80% during the period. Others such as XRP, ETH and BCH have fallen by 58%, 68% and 75% respectively.

Litecoin’s mild decline is due to its strong performance for most of the year thus far. As far as top-10 altcoin price gains go for 2019, LTC has repeatedly been at the top. During its period of positive price performance, some analysts pointed to the upcoming block reward halving event as the key driver.

There have been numerous comparisons drawn between the cryptocurrency scene and the dot-com era of the 1990s and early 2000s. Apart from the potentially paradigm-altering potential of cryptos, some analysts have also drawn another likely commonality between the two eras — the crash of the market.

Often times, there is the talk of a coming crypto apocalypse that would eliminate from existence many of the over 2,000 altcoin species around today. The aftermath would be similar to the period of the post-dot-com bubble, which saw the rise of the internet giants known across the globe in this present time. Brandt encapsulated this argument in a tweet published at the back end of June 2019, saying:

“Many altcoins benefited from the last bull run in $BTC. Cryptomaniancs expect alts to do so again — they may be very disappointed. 2000 .com bubble is analog. Following 2001-02 tech collapse, dotcoms with real value exploded. The ‘alt’ .coms went bankrupt.”

Whether judgment day is at hand for altcoins remains a matter of debate, but there are some projects already showing disturbing signs. A report by blockchain data analytics firm Coinmetrics, for example, showed that a weather app was responsible for about 96% of the total transactions on the Bitcoin SV blockchain.

During the 2018 bear market, commentators like Xapo President Ted Rogers expressed the belief that the price downturn could be the beginning of a mass extinction event for altcoins. For Rogers, as many as 90% of all altcoin variants stood the risk of becoming nonexistent.

Rogers isn’t alone in this belief, as Barry Silbert of Digital Currency Group and Bitwise Asset Management’s Matt Hougan have also espoused similar sentiments. As reported by Cointelegraph in mid-February 2019, Silbert predicted that most altcoins “will go to zero,” while declaring Bitcoin to the premier cryptocurrency. Also in February 2019, Cointelegraph reported Hougan saying that 95% of all cryptocurrencies will die.",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/u-s-regulator-probing-crypto-exchange-bitmex-over-client-trades,"Why did this happen?

The Indian government has finally spoken up about the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency it has been deliberating, providing answers to questions presented in the upper house of the Parliament of India. The government also confirmed that the report with the recommended crypto regulation has already been submitted by the interministerial committee tasked with drafting the regulation.

Crypto Not Prohibited in India

At a sitting on July 16 of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, five questions were directed at the Minister of Finance by Parliament member Shri Dharmapuri Srinivas regarding the “Prohibition of cryptocurrency” in India.

The set of questions begins with: “Will the Minister of Finance be pleased to state: (a) whether [the] government has prohibited cryptocurrency in the country; (b) if so, the details thereof.”

A document containing answers to these questions started circulating on social media Thursday. It shows that the answers were provided on July 16 by Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance.

Answering the first two questions above, Minister Thakur simply wrote: “No, Sir.”

Government Confirms Crypto Report Submitted

The next two questions request information regarding “(c) whether [the] government has taken note about [the] prevalence of cryptocurrency in the country; (d) if so, the details thereof.” The Minister of State replied:

Taking note of the issue, the government has constituted an interministerial committee (IMC) under the chairmanship of Secretary (DA). The IMC has submitted the report to the government.

The interministerial committee tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrency and providing a recommended crypto regulatory framework is headed by Secretary of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg who is also the country’s finance secretary. The committee has representation from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (Meity), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), and the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT).

Action Taken on Crypto-Related Issues

The last question requests information on “(e) the action taken against the persons who are responsible for running the cryptocurrency in the market?” The Minister of State answered:

Presently, there is no separate law for dealing with issues relating to cryptocurrencies. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies, such as RBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities, etc. take action as per the relevant existing laws.

The minister continued: “Similarly, police/courts take action on IPC offences. Further, in view of the risks and dangers associated with cryptocurrencies, [the] government and RBI have been issuing advisories, press releases and circulars to the public.”

Besides public warning notices regarding the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, the central bank has issued a circular banning regulated entities from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect on July 6 last year.

Similar Answers to Lok Sabha

On July 8, Minister Thakur also answered some questions in Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, about whether there is a plan to ban cryptocurrency in India. “Will the Minister of Corporate Affairs be pleased to state: (a) whether the government has any proposal to ban cryptocurrency in India,” Parliament member S. Gnanathiraviam asked.

At that time, Minister Thakur stated that “The issue of permitting trading in cryptocurrencies is currently under examination” by the aforementioned interministerial committee. He then repeated the answers his ministry provided Lok Sabha on Dec. 28 last year:

In absence of a globally acceptable solution and the need to devise technically feasible solution, the department is pursuing the matter with due caution. It is difficult to state a specific timeline to come up with clear recommendations.

Supreme Court Hearing Coming Up

In response to the banking restriction imposed by the RBI, a number of industry participants filed writ petitions to challenge the ban. The Indian supreme court is scheduled to hear the case on July 23.

The court was originally set to hear all the writ petitions against the RBI ban in September last year, but it continually postponed hearing the case in full. Meanwhile, the banking restriction continues and at least four crypto exchanges in India have had to shut down for this reason. Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in the country, closed its Indian exchange operation in September last year. Coindelta followed suit in March, and Coinome made a similar announcement in May. Last month, Koinex also decided to shut down its exchange.

In February, the Indian supreme court gave the government four weeks to submit the report containing the crypto regulation recommended by the Garg committee. However, when the time was up, the court adjourned without addressing this matter.

Rumored Bill to Ban Crypto

Since the Indian government has been tight-lipped about its recommended legal framework for cryptocurrency, rumors of what the Garg committee’s report entails are rampant. In particular, the Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019 has been heavily cited by the media such as The Economic Times and Bloombergquint. Among others, the bill proposes prohibition of a range of crypto activities.

However, experts have analyzed the bill’s content and agreed that, if this is the bill recommended by the Garg committee, it is nowhere near final. News.Bitcoin.com recently provided experts’ analyses and comments on this bill, as well as a preliminary analysis of its original leaked content.

“This document cannot be claimed as the final recommendation of the expert committee to the Ministry of Finance. The document contains no mark of authentication on it nor it has come out from any official source,” Advocate Mohammed Danish, co-founder of Crypto Kanoon, an Indian platform for blockchain and crypto regulatory news and analysis, told news.Bitcoin.com. Varun Sethi, founder of Blockchain Lawyer, shares a similar sentiment. “This looks like a very very rough draft of a proposed bill,” he opined, adding that it might just be “a random discussion paper and it may not actually become [a] bill in the same manner and mode in which this has been stated.”

Impact of G20 and FATF on India’s Crypto Regulation

Garg said that his committee’s report with the recommended crypto framework for India was ready in early June, a week before he attended the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, on June 8 and 9.

Both Garg and India’s new finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, attended the meeting where all G20 finance ministers and central bank governors jointly declared their commitments to applying the crypto standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental standard-setting body in areas such as money laundering. The FATF released its updated guidance for crypto assets on July 21, almost two months after Garg said his committee’s report was ready.

Furthermore, during the G20 leaders’ summit in Osaka, Japan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of the other G20 nations jointly declared their commitments to applying the FATF standards.

The G20 meetings this year were hosted by Japan, where cryptocurrency has been legalized as a means of payment since April 2017. Crypto exchanges in the country are regulated by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), which has so far approved 19 of them to legally operate in the country.

Coinbase Bundle product is no more

Reasons for discontinuation of the product — which had only just launched in fall 2018 — have not been officially provided, with the exchange simply notifying users that:

“Coinbase Bundle purchases have been deprecated, as such all assets purchased in the Coinbase Bundle have been redistributed to their respective individual asset wallets.”

In a further comment, Coinbase says that while users will no longer see a standalone wallet for their Coinbase Bundle purchases, the amount of cryptocurrencies purchased as part of the package will not have changed and is thus “a cosmetic-only change.”

Coinbase Bundles has been designed to purportedly simplify cryptocurrency trading and draw new investors into the sector.

Each bundle was a basket of five cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) — supported on Coinbase and purchased in proportion to their market capitalization in USD. The smallest bundle was sold by the exchange for as little as $25, 25 British pounds or 25 Euros.

A changing crypto landscape

Earlier this week, Coinbase released aggregated data in the form of three trading signals designed to offer investment insights for its customers: top holder activity, typical hold time and popularity, and price correlation.

In June, the exchange published its key findings about awareness and adoption trends related to cryptocurrency in the U.S., revealing that 58% of Americans have heard about Bitcoin (BTC).

Other U.S.-based crypto trading platforms have similarly launched investment vehicles designed to streamline trading, such as the Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini exchange, which offers a Cryptoverse product tied to a basket of cryptocurrencies weighted by market cap to be bought as a single order.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/19/tim-draper-says-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin-are-good-for-humanity.html,"Venture capitalist Tim Draper told CNBC on Friday that bitcoin is good for humanity and that federal regulators should give it room to flourish.

Cryptocurrencies have faced increased criticism from Washington, D.C., after Facebook announced that it and dozens of other companies are developing a new cryptocurrency called Libra.

However, Draper said on ""Squawk Alley"" that he believes the larger spotlight is good for bitcoin overall.

""It's bringing it to light. It's good to have people talk about it because the more they talk about it, the more they realize how important bitcoin is going to be for the planet, for all of us,"" Draper said.

The veteran tech investor cited the potential for decreased transaction costs and ease of international payments as ways that cryptocurrencies would benefit humanity.

""This is one of the best things that's ever happened to us,"" Draper said.

Draper — one of the first investors in failed blood-testing start-up Theranos and a defender of its embattled founder, Elizabeth Holmes — said regulators are making a mistake by preemptively regulating cryptocurrencies.

David Marcus, the Facebook executive in charge of the company's Libra efforts, testified in front of Congress for two days this week and faced criticism from both sides of the aisle.

Draper said the federal government should back off and allow cryptocurrencies to grow or it risks losing the innovation to other countries.

""Facebook's just announced Libra. They haven't even been able to ship it yet, and the regulators are all over them,"" Draper said. ""Let them ship the thing. Let's see how it happens. Let's let things roll, and then if there's a problem, then, great, now it's time for regulators to step in.""

The price of bitcoin has swung considerably several times in recent weeks with the increased focus on cryptocurrencies due to the Libra proposal. The bitcoin price has been both above $13,000 and below $10,000 within the last month.

Draper is a longtime bitcoin bull, predicting last year that the price would reach $250,000 in 2022.

Crytpocurrencies have received heavy interest from mainstream companies. In addition to the Libra project, several financial firms, including J.P. Morgan, are working on their own crypto projects.

Despite the efforts from corporate giants, Draper still believes bitcoin will be the dominant cryptocurrency.

""All these other cryptos are bridges to where we have a bitcoin environment, and the governments are all trying to figure it out. It turns out, our government has a lot of heavy regulators and they're all trying to get involved here,"" Draper said.",2019-07-19,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/07/19/ask-a-fool-how-is-facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-d.aspx,"Q: I've been following the story about Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency and was wondering what makes it different from bitcoin?

There are currently more than 2,600 different cryptocurrencies, including 14 that have more than $1 billion in total value. One might wonder why we could possibly need another.

First, there's a big fundamental difference between bitcoin, most other leading cryptocurrencies, and Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) upcoming Libra.

Libra is designed as a so-called stable coin, meaning that its value will be pegged to another currency -- in this case, the U.S. dollar. Facebook's goal is to get 100 partners to each contribute $10 million in funding in order to get a $1 billion reserve pool. In other words, if this happens and there are a billion Libra in circulation, each coin will be worth exactly $1.

This is a sharp contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, whose values can fluctuate rapidly. In fact, bitcoin lost 17% of its value in the 24 hours before I wrote this.

Second, it's important to point out that there are some stable coins already in existence. Most notably is Tether, a stable coin with nearly $4 billion in total circulating $1-denominated virtual coins.

However, there's no way to readily use Tether and other stable coins to pay for everyday online purchases. That's where Facebook's 2.7 billion unique users, 90 million businesses who have Facebook pages, and the project's numerous partners including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, and eBay come in. Widespread consumer adoption and ease of use when it comes to actually buying things could be a big differentiator.

In short, Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency has two key factors that set it apart from other cryptocurrencies. Its value is not going to be volatile, and it could be easily used to make purchases. That's why it isn't just another bitcoin.",2019-07-19,https://www.coindesk.com/short-of-target-bitcoins-1k-rally-still-leaves-bearish-bias-intact,"View

Bitcoin’s short-term outlook will remain bearish as long as prices remain below $11,080 resistance. A break above that level would invalidate bearish lower-highs setup.

The bulls may have a tough time forcing a break above $11,080 amid news of BitMEX exchange facing a regulatory probe and talks of harsher crypto regulation.

Prices could drop below $10,000 in the next 24 hours with daily chart indicators continuing to report bearish bias.

A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to revive the bullish view.

Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied sharply in the last 24 hours, but the outlook remains bearish with prices holding below key resistance around $11,080.

The premier cryptocurrency jumped from $9,200 to $10,400 in just 40 minutes during the U.S. session yesterday, contradicting the case for a drop below $9,097 put forward by multiple rejections at $10,000 in the Asian trading hours.

Price rose further to $10,800 at 23:45 UTC, but closed at $10,648, leaving the crucial resistances of $10,759 (monthly opening price) and $10,850 (daily chart resistance) intact, as tweeted by popular analyst Josh Rager.

Rager wants to see BTC climb $10,850 before calling bullish revival. While that argument has merit, a much stronger confirmation of the bullish breakout would be a high volume move above $11,080.

That would invalidate the bearish lower highs pattern created during the sell-off from $13,200 to $9,049, as seen in the chart below.

Bearish lower highs

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,330 on Bitstamp, having clocked highs above $10,770 at 08:00 UTC.

The cryptocurrency has come under pressure in the last hour or so amid news that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is probing BitMEX, which offers trading of cryptocurrencies with up to 100-times leverage and products such as futures and swaps, over whether it allowed Americans to use its platform.

The latest CFTC probe could heighten regulation fears that have gripped markets over the last few days, making it difficult for BTC bulls to force a break above $11,070.

Technical charts are also calling a break below $10,000.

4-hour and daily charts

BTC is feeling the pull of gravity, having faced multiple rejections at the 50-candle MA on the 4-hour chart (above left) in the last 18 hours.

With bitcoin’s fall back to $10,300, the bearish crossover of the 50- and 200-candle MAs has gained credence.

Further, the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart continues to report bearish conditions with a below-50 print.

The Chaikin money flow index, which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, fell to 0.07 yesterday from 0.08, even though prices rose above $10,000. That divergence (marked by arrow) indicates the buying pressure weakened with the price rise and puts a question mark on the sustainability of the gains seen in the last 24 hours.

3-day chart

The 5- and 10-candle MAs have produced a bearish crossover and prices faced rejection at the descending 5-candle MA earlier today.

Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) has turned bearish for the first time since December 2018, as discussed earlier this week.

All-in-all, BTC risks falling below $10,000 in the next 24 hours. On the downside, strong support is located at $9,097 (May 30 high). A violation there would expose the 100-day MA lined up near $8,100.

On the higher side, a high-volume break above $11,080 would invalidate the bearish setup.

That said, a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to confirm bull revival due to the fact that BTC has failed to close above that psychological level for three weeks in a row – a sign of buyer exhaustion noted earlier this week.

Natural gas acquired as a byproduct of oil extraction has become synonymous with wasted energy. In certain areas, drilling companies are unable to find a profitable market for the excess fuel. It’s often vented into the atmosphere. Startups are now offering on-site systems that utilize the surplus to mine cryptocurrencies. This new business is growing in regions where shale oil and gas extraction are major industries.

Fossil Fuels Aren’t Going Anywhere

At least for the foreseeable future, traditional energy sources such as oil and gas are here to stay. Their abundance and relatively low price compared to some renewables, their utility, mobility and well developed supporting infrastructure are hard to beat. However, despite these obvious advantages, getting them out of the ground can sometimes be a wasteful process.

Electricity is the primary cost of bitcoin mining and while coin minting is often powered by renewables like hydro, energy from traditional sources is widely used as well. Cryptocurrency mining can utilize the surplus fuel that would otherwise be wasted, and the oil and gas industry is a good example of this. With the spread of alternative methods of extraction to even remote, hard-to-access places, the need for on-site consumers grows.

New shale oil wells have been popping up across North America and other parts of the world in the past few years. They are often located far from potential markets, and the transportation of certain byproducts such as methane and other compounds forming natural gas is not always economically viable, because grid prices are too low or because expensive additional infrastructure is needed to transport the fuel.

Associated gas, or flare gas, is a liability for oil companies and they have several options for dealing with it. If a well is close to a market, producers can pipe it to end consumers. Alternatively, they can flare it or vent it into the atmosphere. However, authorities in the U.S. and Canada impose restrictions on the amount of gas that can be released or burned. Exceeding these limits usually leads to costly production stoppages.

Crypto Mining Makes Excess Gas Profitable

Installing bitcoin mining equipment at oil production sites provides a solution to these problems. Some companies are already offering this type of service. Gas engines are used to generate electricity and power mining rigs. Oil producers remain compliant with venting quotas and receive additional income, while ensuring uninterrupted oil extraction. Mining rewards can be significantly higher than the price most companies get when they sell gas to the grid. At the same time, nature is spared from a very potent greenhouse gas – methane gas is 25 times more harmful than CO2.

Upstream Data is a Canadian company offering mobile mining datacenters that can be bought or rented by oil companies and installed at facilities which need to vent associated gas. They can bring in over 15 times more revenue than the market price of the fuel, while limiting carbon footprint. The datacenters come in different configurations depending on their equipment and power rating. The all-in-one Ohmm Combo can be ordered with up to 125 kW of ASICs and a natural gas genset, all housed in a modified shipping container. The midrange version starts at 28,000 Canadian dollars ($21,400). A new product called Ohmm Mini, a 50 kW stackable datacenter, is also on sale, and Ohmm Mega, a 1,000 kW datacenter, is currently under development.

Upstream Data founder and CEO Stephen Barbour, who is a mechanical engineer with eight years of experience in the oil industry, told news.Bitcoin.com that his business continues to pick up. Earlier this month, he tweeted about the commissioning of a new Ohmm datacenter in Texas. The entrepreneur noted that media reports on his solutions have brought more legitimacy to crypto mining as a means of utilizing stranded gas. His company continues to get new orders and is conducting trials with small and large groups. “A lot of great things are happening for us so we’re pretty excited to expand our services,” Barbour said and added:

Aside from the oil industry, our datacenters can also be used in traditional mining applications. However, I believe the future of bitcoin mining is in the oil and gas industry due to the enormity of the energy produced and wasted.

Huge Amounts of Stranded Gas Flared Each Year

Various studies have shown that oil companies vent or flare enormous quantities of natural gas year after year. According to the World Bank, 5.3 trillion cubic feet (150 billion cubic meters) of natural gas is flared annually, which amounts to 25% of the total consumption in the United States. An analysis conducted by General Electric claims that 5% of the global gas production is flared annually. It has been estimated that the stranded natural gas accounts for up to 60% of the planet’s reserves.

EZ Blockchain is another company expanding its operations in the sector. It has designed a mobile flare mitigation system which can be deployed on oil well pads and mine digital coins using energy from the flared gas. Its EZ Smartbox portable mining units are powered by gas-electric generators to convert associated gas into electricity used in data processing including crypto mining. The Chicago-based company has already delivered 13 mobile units to three locations, with 6 MWs under operation and 64 PH/s of hash power. To find out more about these operations and get further insights about the industry, news.Bitcoin.com contacted Sergii Gerasymovych, founder of EZ Blockchain.

“Our primary area of operation and target market is the Bakken region in North Dakota, which has very rich gas being flared, with over 1,500 BTU/ft3. Raw gas is dirty, it consists of methane, butane, hexane, pentane, ethane, and other gases. NGL companies are required by law to clean it before it can be burned and producers spend money to do that,” the entrepreneur explained.

In the smallest configuration of the EZ Smartgrid solution, a 350 kW datacenter can be equipped with 250 S9 miners and utilize up to 100 MCF of gas daily with a gas-electric generator. “This is a drop in the ocean for oil producers, but we worked hard to solve the scaling problem. We strategically partnered with a distributor of generators from Jenbacher with a power range of 200 kW to 10 MW and flexibility to run either on natural gas or a number of other gases,” Gerasymovych noted. He thinks this is a game changer as the average small well in North Dakota produces around 350 MCF of gas daily, and an oil pad can have five or more wells.

The company is currently working with one oil producer in the Bakken region and is about to start operations with another. Its team is also evaluating a 10 MW location in the Appalachian Basin. EZ Blockchain’s founder believes there’s huge opportunity for the expansion of this type of crypto mining, particularly in North America where due to the shale boom, there are many wells where gas is flared. This fuel isn’t going anywhere and building pipes is not economically feasible.

There is enough wasted gas in North Dakota alone to power a third of Bitcoin’s whole network. Bitcoin mining can be done completely off-grid, solving an environmental problem.

Sergii Gerasymovych expects more drilling companies to install and operate on-site mining equipment to utilize the excess gas that would otherwise be wasted. However, this will not happen quickly as the oil and gas industry is very conservative. It’s going to take time for small to midsize companies to look for a new, innovative approach. “They are in the business of pumping oil, not mining bitcoin. That’s why EZ Blockchain usually runs the mining operations,” he remarked.

Gerasymovych emphasized that these operations generally require a lot of investment into gas generation equipment upfront. “This is another obstacle we face with oil producers. Small companies can operate tens of wells and midsize companies – hundreds or even thousands. That means very big mining operations have to be built and funded in order for the flaring problem to go away completely,” he explained. Oil and gas companies are a bit hesitant to invest money in an industry which they do not know well and it may take more time before the technology becomes a mainstream solution.

The expansion of the shale oil industry in North America and the scale of gas wastage have created ideal conditions for services such as those offered by Upstream Data and EZ Blockchain, and they are not the only companies that are working to utilize the abundant byproduct in crypto mining applications. The U.S.-based Crusoe Energy Systems is developing its own solutions in the niche, helping oil and gas producers to reduce gas flaring while making a profit by verifying crypto transactions. This spring, the startup raised $4.5 million in a seed funding round led by Bain Capital Ventures and Founders Fund Pathfinder, bringing its total funding to $5.1 million.

The capital will be used to finance the production of Crusoe’s mobile datacenters designed to mine digital coins at oil drilling sites. The goal is to provide a large-scale flare mitigation service for oil and gas extraction companies across North America. Crusoe’s modular datacenter units are installed in shipping containers and can be quickly deployed on any oil well site in the U.S. and Canada to start mining within days. The systems not only reduce flaring but also eliminate most of the smog-forming emissions of volatile compounds such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO).

Decentralizing Power Consumption in Bitcoin Mining

While cryptocurrency mining has become more and more centralized over the years, there’s a strong case that the generation of power used in the process will be gradually decentralizing, thanks to solutions like these. Datacenters running on stranded gas do mine on pools, but they are mobile units that can be installed anywhere. As the hunt for cheap energy intensifies, with electricity being the main expense in bitcoin mining, more and more businesses are likely to develop products allowing for the use of energy close to its source.

Companies specializing in flare gas utilization have some challenges to overcome. Datacenters require maintenance, rigs need to be restarted sometimes, fuel pipes can freeze, and it can be hard to establish a reliable internet connection in remote places. Add to that the low efficiency of gas engines used to power the mining modules – it’s less than 30% and most of the energy is still lost as heat and through the exhaust pipe. Bans imposed on shale oil and gas extraction and fracking also pose a threat to the business.

Nevertheless, bitcoin mining remains a viable option for energy companies operating far from potential markets and under strict regulations on venting and flaring. Mining containers can also be installed at ordinary natural gas fields and exploited whenever coin minting is more profitable than selling the fuel to other consumers. Along with Canada and the U.S., Russia, China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are among the largest natural gas producers in the world. Global proven reserves have been estimated at 6.95 quadrillion cubic feet.

Since the project launched a little over six months ago, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has roughly $5.9 million or 558 BTC locked into the system. At the rate WBTC’s token contract is climbing, the project is close to surpassing the Lightning Network’s capacity in the near future.

Wrapped Bitcoin Contract Captures 558 BTC

In January, Bitgo, Kyber Network, and Ren (formerly Republic Protocol) revealed the creation of a new ERC20 token project called Wrapped Bitcoin, a token created on the Ethereum network that’s been gathering a bunch of growth recently. Essentially WBTC is an ERC20 token backed by bitcoin core (BTC) at a 1:1 ratio. The creators of WBTC explained during the token’s launch that the system was designed to bring more liquidity into the crypto ecosystem. At the moment, the token contract’s locked BTC has climbed significantly in value, gathering 558 BTC with roughly $5.9 million in value. The numbers have been impressive since the project started in January and reached a million dollars by the first week of May. Since April 16, the amount of BTC added to the WBTC contract has grown by 272%.

In comparison to the Lightning Network’s growth, the WBTC contract is growing much faster and they both provide similar functionality. Since February 2018, the Lightning Network capacity has held around 5.5 BTC or roughly $46,000 and it’s taken more than a year to climb past $10 million and reached an all-time high of $12 million last month. At the time of writing, the Lighting Network’s current capacity is $9.5 million or 911 BTC. While the Lightning Network’s capacity has been dwindling, there’s been a lot more demand for WBTC tokens. WBTC can be obtained from a number of exchanges like Airswap, Hitbtc, Kyber, Radarrelay, Uniswap, and Imtoken. The project now has a slew of merchants like Grapefruit Trading and the San Francisco-based security platform Bitgo has been acting as the custodian for the WBTC project’s reserves as well.

WBTC’s recent popularity is also due in part to the cryptocurrency infrastructure providers giving the asset support. On July 16, the Compound protocol, an open source lending platform that compounds interest on the Ethereum blockchain, announced its support for WBTC. The Compound community voted on adding WBTC in January, but there were some delays, like the length of time it took for bitcoins to get wrapped. After the project reached a level of maturity, Compound community members were “clamoring” for the coin to be supported. Now the team behind the Compound software has deployed WBTC and users are now able to earn interest on and borrow WBTC. “The market uses the same interest rate model as ETH, BAT, ZRX, and REP, and the initial exchange rate is 0.0200,” the Compound team detailed. So far, $32,000 worth of WBTC loans has been issued since the launch on Compound.

A week prior, on July 8, the NEO-based cross-chain atomic swap exchange Switcheo also launched WBTC on the trading platform. Switcheo’s Jack Yeu explained: “For the first time, traders around the world will be able to buy or sell NEO with the BTC-pegged token, WBTC, in a trustless manner via Switcheo’s cross-chain atomic swaps.” Adding WBTC is part of Switcheo’s goal toward creating a network with cross-chain swapping capabilities across multiple chains. WBTC has added a lot of value into the Ethereum ecosystem and between all the decentralized finance (defi) platforms like WBTC, Maker, and Compound, defi protocols command more than 2% of the entire ETH supply.

Another Instance of Wrapping BTC Using the Bitcoin Cash Network

The rise of WBTC also follows the recent launch of a Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) token that has similar attributes. The SLP token built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network is called BTC2 and the pegged token is issued by the platform Sideshift.ai. According to the Sideshift creator, BTC2 tokens are backed 1:1 with BTC and people who don’t live in the U.S. can obtain the token using the Sideshift swapping application. BTC2 tokens (not to be confused with the BTC snapshot fork of the same name) use the same BCH network fee to transact which means people can send BTC without paying high transaction fees.

Similarly to sending WBTC, owners must sign a transaction that requires a certain amount of gas or gwei. In contrast, BCH or SLP transactions typically have a network fee of around $0.001 to $0.005 on average. At the time of publication, there are 100 BTC2 tokens in existence which is a touch more than $1 million worth at current BTC market prices. Sideshift’s creator Andreas Brekken told news.Bitcoin.com that with Sideshift acting as the custodian of people’s BTC, it adds a counterparty, which means BTC2 can also open new doors such as earning interest.

In addition to both WBTC and BTC2, there’s Blockstream’s LBTC, a project aimed at facilitating large amounts of BTC transfers offchain. However, unlike the two aforementioned tokens created on public blockchains, LBTC is a federated sidechain using a number of exchanges as the trusted federation. It’s interesting and ironic that there are people with millions of dollars between WBTC, BTC2, and LBTC that think it’s valuable to transact with BTC using alternative chains with lower fees. Moreover, as WBTC comes close to surpassing the Lightning Network’s capacity, one could conclude that it’s easier to transact with WBTC or BTC2 than learning to grasp the technical aspects of the Lightning Network.

G7 finance chiefs met this week and Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency was high on their agenda. They agreed on several crypto initiatives and fast regulatory responses to projects such as Libra, calling for them to meet the highest standards of financial regulation.

A Call for Urgent Action

The G7 finance ministers and central bank governors met in Chantilly, north of Paris, for a two-day conference on July 17 and 18. Other than France, which chairs this year’s meetings, the G7 comprises Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. In addition, the European Union has participated fully in the G7 since 1981 as a “nonenumerated” member. At the end of their meeting, the ministers issued the Chair’s Summary of the decisions made.

“Ministers and governors acknowledged that while innovation in the financial sector can bring substantial benefits, it can also entail risks,” the statement reads. “They agreed that stablecoins and other various new products currently being developed, including projects with global and potentially systemic footprint such as Libra, raise serious regulatory and systemic concerns, as well as wider policy issues, which both need to be addressed before such projects can be implemented.” The summary details:

Regarding regulatory concerns, ministers and governors agreed that possible ‘stablecoin’ initiatives and their operators would in any case need to meet the highest standards of financial regulation.

“Regarding systemic concerns, ministers and governors agreed that projects such as Libra may affect monetary sovereignty and the functioning of the international monetary system,” the Chair’s Summary continues.

“On Libra, we had a very constructive and detailed discussion with a very large and shared consensus on the need for action,” a French official told the AFP news agency. After chairing the first day’s meeting, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire was quoted by Reuters as saying:

The sovereignty of nations cannot be jeopardised … The overall mood around the table was clearly one of important concerns about the recent Libra announcements, and a shared view that action is needed urgently.

“The issuance of a currency does not belong in the hands of a private company because it is a core feature of a sovereign state,” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz proclaimed. Asserting that Facebook’s plans do not “seem to be fully thought through,” he is convinced Libra “cannot go ahead without all legal and regulatory questions being resolved,” the news outlet added. A senior Japanese finance ministry official who was at the meeting told the press:

Most G7 members saw Libra as posing a serious problem from the perspective of consumer data protection and the impact on monetary policy.

Facebook recently unveiled its plans for Calibra, a new subsidiary aimed at providing financial services via the Libra network. “The first product Calibra will introduce is a digital wallet for Libra, a new global currency powered by blockchain technology,” the company described.

Global Coordination and G7 Working Group

The G7 has set up a working group on stablecoins, coordinated by Benoit Coeure, Chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI). Its preliminary findings were provided at the meeting.

The group consists initially of senior officials from the G7 central banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank for International Settlements and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Chair’s Summary reveals, adding that it will be expanded to representatives from G7 ministries of finance. The group will also coordinate with the G20 and other relevant standard-setting bodies. Its final report and recommendations are expected by the time of the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in October.

Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda believes that, given the potential impact of Libra on the global economy, the G7 working group would evolve over time to include a broader range of regulators, elaborating:

If the Libra is aspiring to be used globally, countries must seek a globally coordinated response … This is not something that can be discussed among G7 central banks alone.

Central bankers have emphasized that Facebook needs a banking license if it wants to take deposits, with some expressing concerns about allowing people to transact anonymously.

Japan’s Own Crypto-Focused Working Group

In response to Facebook’s Libra plans, Japanese regulators also set up a working group ahead of the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting to discuss the potential impact of the planned digital currency on monetary policy and financial regulation, Reuters reported government sources revealing.

This working group consists of Japan’s central bank, Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Agency (FSA) which is in charge of the country’s banking regulation. “The group has started comprehensive discussions on various aspects of stablecoins,” Mainichi publication reported Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso as saying after the G7 meeting. Sources told Reuters that the group “will seek to coordinate policies to address the impact Libra could have on regulation, monetary policy, tax and payments settlement.”

The officials explained:

Japan hopes to rally support from other countries to expand the task force into a bigger group of tax and financial regulators, given the wide range of policies that could be affected by digital currencies.

As this year’s chair of the G20 meetings, Japan will look at ways to align separate efforts made by the G7 and G20 to address the policy implications of Libra, the officials noted.

At the G20 summit last month, the G20 leaders declared that “crypto-assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point.” However, they “are closely monitoring developments and remain vigilant to existing and emerging risks.” The leaders also asked the FSB and other standard-setting bodies “to advise on additional multilateral responses as needed.”

Global Network for Crypto Payments

The Japanese government is also setting up “an international network for cryptocurrency payments, similar to the SWIFT network used by banks, in an effort to fight money laundering,” Reuters reported Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The plan, proposed by the country’s Ministry of Finance and the FSA, is for the network to be in place in the next few years, the publication noted. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental standard-setting body in areas such as money laundering, will monitor the system’s development and Japan will cooperate with other countries. The FATF approved the plan for this new network in June, according to the source.

Moving Beyond Current Regulations

Japan’s finance minister urged his G7 counterparts Wednesday to comprehensively assess Libra for any new challenges that may fall outside of existing regulations, emphasizing:

Applying existing regulations alone may not be enough. A comprehensive examination is needed to see if Libra poses new challenges that existing rules do not take into account.

“On the other hand, authorities need to respond in a timely fashion so they’re not behind the curve,” the finance minister opined.

Libra Grilled by US Lawmakers

Facebook executive and Calibra CEO David Marcus appeared before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee this week. The committees asked him questions such as how Libra could affect global monetary policy and how customer data will be protected.

“Facebook has demonstrated through scandal after scandal that it doesn’t deserve our trust … We’d be crazy to give them a chance to let them experiment with people’s bank accounts,” Senator Sherrod Brown said in his opening remarks.

Rep. Andy Barr said to Marcus: “Tell me how Libra will not undermine sovereign currencies and central banks, or is the very point to undermine central bankers and to provide a greater freedom away from central banking?” The Facebook executive responded: “I want to be very clear, we do not want to compete with the dollar or sovereign currencies.”

During Wednesday’s hearing, Rep. Brad Sherman compared the potential consequences of Facebook’s crypto project to the terrorist attacks of 9/11. “We’re told by some that innovation is always good … The most innovative thing that’s happened this century is when Osama bin Laden came up with the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers,” he claimed. Sherman asserted that if successful, Libra could be “one of the biggest things this committee will deal with this decade,” then questioned why Marcus appeared in Congress for Facebook instead of CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

“I don’t think you should launch Libra at all,” Rep. Carolyn Maloney told Marcus, while Rep. Madeleine Dean said, “I think before you move on to Libra, you ought to clean up the messes of the past.” According to Marcus:

Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulatory concerns and received appropriate approvals.

Last week, President Donald Trump spoke out about the potential misuse of cryptocurrencies to facilitate unlawful behavior. He’s right that crypto assets are sometimes used by bad actors, but every currency and payments system in the world is exploited in this way.

We need to go beyond the sensationalist headlines to understand how to solve the money-laundering problem.

Less than 0.5% of Bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases

According to analysis my company conducted, so far in 2019, $829 million in Bitcoin has been spent on the dark web. These payments were used to purchase everything from narcotics to stolen credit cards. Compare this with the annual value of global illicit payments, estimated to be up to $2.2 trillion.

Illicit payments represent a very small share of all Bitcoin activity — less than 0.5% of Bitcoin payments over this period. The total proceeds of crime generated in the United States were estimated to total approximately $300 billion in 2010, or about two percent of the overall U.S. economy at the time.

The share of Bitcoin transactions that can be linked to illicit activity has dropped dramatically over the past few years, for two key reasons.

First, speculation has emerged as the primary use-case for crypto assets, with both retail and institutional trading activity soaring.

Second, there is a growing awareness that crypto asset transactions are not anonymous, and that illicit payments can be identified and traced.

Blockchain can facilitate compliance

The majority of crypto assets, including Libra, are based on transparent transaction ledgers. Anyone can download the Bitcoin blockchain and see the details of every transaction. Real-world identities are not recorded, but blockchain monitoring tools can be used to associate transactions with identified parties, be they regulated wallets or ransomware operators. The complete transaction trail left on public blockchains also allows us to view the end-to-end history of funds flowing across cryptocurrency ecosystems, providing a comprehensive audit trail of all transactions ever undertaken. Compare this with cash transactions, where there is zero visibility of the transaction trail; or traditional bank transfers, where records and information about transactions remain siloed between institutions and don’t provide a complete picture of fund flows.

Law enforcement agencies have exploited this capability to aid the take-downs of dark marketplaces, the dismantling of cybercrime gangs, and the identification of money launderers. The old crime-fighting mantra of “follow the money” is proving more effective than ever, with investigators crossing their fingers that criminals continue to use cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrency companies are also using the blockchain to monitor for illicit transactions. In the US, crypto exchanges and other services fall within the scope of the Bank Secrecy Act, obligating them to understand where their customers’ funds are coming from and implement other anti-money laundering (AML) measures. Blockchain monitoring tools allow them to determine the ultimate source of customer deposits, and distinguish between money laundering and innocent transactions.

Delivering Libra with trust and confidence

The reality is, Libra and the businesses that build on top of it will be subject to intensive regulatory scrutiny wherever they operate. Recent guidance issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global AML standard-setter, makes clear that crypto service providers will be held to the same standard as banks and other financial institutions.

On Monday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin spoke at length on this subject. He explained that US regulators “will not allow digital asset service providers to operate in the shadows.” Members of the Senate Banking Committee voiced concerns that Libra could be used for illicit purposes when Facebook’s David Marcus testified on Tuesday, and they questioned how Libra will ensure compliance with US AML requirements.

Ultimately, successful compliance is entirely possible within existing AML regulatory frameworks, and Libra can provide confidence that it is being used legitimately using tried-and-tested techniques.

Like Bitcoin, Libra transactions are transparent. This was no doubt a conscious decision, since it allows the same kinds of blockchain monitoring tools to be built for it that already exist for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This will allow law enforcement agencies to trace proceeds of crime in Libra, and allow Libra services such as wallets and exchanges to fulfill their AML obligations.

Regulators and policymakers are right to demand accountability and transparency around the Libra project. No one wants to see new financial innovations facilitating crime and terrorism.

Fortunately, the blockchain monitoring technology needed to provide trust and confidence in the legitimacy of Libra transactions is already here.

By the time I typed this, altcoins rallied, then Bitcoin jumped over USD 10K. That happened.

In the ever-larger world of regulations-related news, a Chinese court reportedly recognized Bitcoin as having legal value as property; U.S. CFTC is investigating BitMEX; U.S. lawmakers are moving fast to stop major IT companies from issuing cryptocurrencies; U.S. Congress can make stablecoins and Libra irrelevant; Crypto Mom is worried about forfeiting innovation to other countries, and the G7 is worried too but about crypto and Libra. Speaking about Libra, Facebook’s main game might actually be Calibra, but either way, there were not one, but two hearings so far to talk about the new coin. Trump famously took aim at Bitcoin and Libra, for which the community thanked him, while the Treasury Secretary is also uncomfortable with Libra.

Meanwhile, South Korean major mobile carriers joined with major companies and banks on a blockchain-powered mobile identification platform collaboration, and LG began offering blockchain-powered mobile phone insurance. Speaking of blockchain, Siemens is looking into ways to use this technology for carsharing, and Pundi X partnered with Verifone to bring crypto to more retailers. It was a good week for Huobi which announced its new stablecoin, and they’re also considering 'a more balanced shift' than Binance’s ‘radical’ BNB burn. And while the anticipated Polkadot announced the “canary-net” that is its experimental version called Kusama, and Ycash, Zchash hard fork went live, Vitalik Buterin was criticized for his ‘Ethereum + Bitcoin Cash’ scalability solution. And in the midst of it all, Ray Dalio brings hope to BTC.

Once all is done, sit back and watch the Roubini vs. Hayes match.

As (almost) every weekend, a crypto song in its celebration: crypto trader subgenre.",,https://www.coindesk.com/could-donald-trump-ban-bitcoin,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and a member of CoinDesk’s product team. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.

Bitcoin yet again graced global headlines last week, after the President of the United States, Donald Trump, took to Twitter to declare himself “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies, “whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

The ensuing discussion largely celebrated the global attention and the fact that bitcoin is now important enough for one of the most powerful men in the world to make a public statement about it. And the crypto markets seemed to shrug it off, signaling with their relative indifference that they have bigger things to worry about.

One potential conversation that has been largely overlooked is how vulnerable bitcoin is to governments the size of the United States. Now that bitcoin has Trump’s attention, will more incendiary statements follow? Will he declare it a “bad idea” that needs “dealing with?” That would not be out of character.

The knee-jerk reaction to the possibility of a bitcoin ban is “yeah, just try it.” Many believe that a ban would be unconstitutional. Most insist that, even if passed, it would have no impact.

These assumptions are bold, largely unchallenged, and deserve a closer look as they mask confusion over what bitcoin is, and how far the influence of the world’s largest economy reaches.

In essence, Trump can try to ban bitcoin. If successful, the ban could have a material impact on the technology’s value. But, he won’t.

(Please note that I am not a lawyer, and there are nuances to every interpretation. Also, I hold a modest amount of bitcoin with no short positions and therefore have no interest in spreading FUD. But investors of all types have to be aware of risks, and the real danger lurks in those we don’t even think about.)

Code is not speech

First, let’s look at how he could do so. Many claim that a ban on using the bitcoin code is a ban on civil liberties. Code is speech, the argument goes, and as such is protected by the First Amendment.

This is not nearly as clear as it seems. Contrary to popular opinion, there has been no official statement supporting the claim – the Bernstein case so often cited, in which a judge upheld the claim that the government could not stop the publication of code, was superseded by appeals and eventually dismissed without an official ruling.

While code may have some elements of speech, in that it can be used to express and communicate, code is also very different. Unlike speech, it executes actions, which can be (and often are) regulated by law, with official enforcement.

Also, writing code as a form of expression is in itself as harmless as speaking your mind. But bitcoin users aren’t writing code, they are executing it. They are taking an action, which could theoretically be declared illegal. And given the public blockchain’s transparency, this would not be impossible to enforce.

Given the size and reach of the U.S. market, its absence from the bitcoin ecosystem would be felt, and not just in the price. Fungibility would come into question – the risk of accepting a bitcoin that a few hops ago was in a U.S.-based wallet could lead to the emergence of parallel markets for “verifiably clean” coins. And the risk of inadvertently sending a payment to a U.S.-based person or entity could push transactions into more expensive and even more traceable vehicles.

Size and might

If Trump is persuaded that going after the bitcoin protocol would be futile, he could still decide to clamp down on cryptocurrency businesses. While it is difficult to stop independent enterprises from handling assets that are not illegal, the imposition of a slew of compliance and fiscal requirements could render such projects no longer viable.

And as we saw with the handling of the U.S. approach to Iran sanctions – the threat of retaliation against any company, no matter its jurisdiction, that violated the ban on trade – it is possible that an aggressive stance from the issuer of the world’s reserve currency could force other sovereign nations to capitulate.

In other words, in the face of a U.S. clampdown, bitcoin would not disappear – its code and operation are decentralized, and the advantages of the technology will always give it some demand – but its potential could be curtailed.

However, this bleak scenario overlooks one important detail: banning bitcoin is not in Trump’s interest.

Play to the base

It’s not so much the colossal fight that a bitcoin ban would get in the courts at all levels that would dissuade him – he has not shied away from that before. More likely to worry him is the alienation of a significant part of his constituency.

Apart from the dissonance of the most anti-establishment president in recent memory attempting to squelch one of this century’s most anti-establishment technologies, one of his electoral pacts was to roll back financial regulation and encourage innovation. Weakening his self-styled image as both a disruptor and a free-market evangelist could damage his voters’ trust and hurt him in the polls.

What’s more, some major Trump-supporting states have spent considerable time and effort in positioning themselves as crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Even Trump’s core team has its converts: his acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, was an early supporter of cryptocurrencies.

While it could be argued that clamping down on bitcoin would be more a step to protect the dollar than an encroachment of federal power (although the administration seems to see Facebook’s Libra as a greater threat), the precedent of trying to stop a particular non-violent use of code will make many enterprises both in and out of finance uncomfortable.

And most of “Wall Street,” the traditional financial institutions that Trump seems to want to cultivate through his fiscal and economic policies, has an interest in bitcoin, through either the development of crypto operations or the investment preferences of institutional clients.

There’s also the allegedly substantial federal holdings through bitcoin seizures to consider.

While Trump’s decisions don’t always seem driven by reason, we should accept that he is an astute politician and is unlikely to embark on a path that could lose him votes and donors.

The upside

The most important takeaway from Trump’s outburst is that bitcoin’s significance has now reached presidential level. While this may elevate the risk of negative repercussions, it also brings forward the potential, highlighting how far the concept has come: once an obscure and complex idea developed by a niche group of coders, bitcoin is now a global phenomenon that has attracted not just support from investors and corporations of all types, but also the attention of world leaders.

In the extremely unlikely event that Trump decides to go after bitcoin, either at the protocol level or on the service layer, he will certainly be vociferously challenged in the courts. The hearings could generate debilitating uncertainty, but at the same time they would push the conversation even further along the path of regulatory clarity, and the resulting decisions on limits to federal power, the freedom inherent in code and even an official recognition of the potential of cryptocurrency will impact tech development at all levels.

I’ve said before that one of the strongest appeals of bitcoin for investors is its asymmetric risk: the chance that it will go to zero (and the impact that would have on a portfolio) is less than the chance its price will increase 10x.

We have here another type of asymmetric risk. The chance that Trump will try to ban bitcoin is not zero, but it is significantly less than the benefit to the ecosystem of the heightened level of conversation. Even though the road may be bumpy, when the President of the United States of America tweets about a decentralized store of value designed to circumvent the power of established finance, it’s hard to deny that the zeitgeist has shifted.

Co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin is now considering third-party blockchains that have lower commission rates for transferring information. According to him, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain could cope well with this task. The fact is that BCH has a high data throughput — 53 kilobytes per second (KPS) compared to Ethereum’s eight KPS, which are actively used by applications, Buterin revealed.

Scalability issues force the hand

Over the years, scalability has been the Achilles' heel of Ethereum, and the team behind the second-largest cryptocurrency has been making every effort to increase it. In the current realities, the Ethereum blockchain is supposed to handle a maximum of 25 transactions per second (TPS), while the charts show that its throughput for July has not exceeded 11 TPS, and on several occasions in recent days, it has even dropped to around seven TPS.

The situation is complicated by a record number of pending transactions per second, which has already exceeded the 600 mark. Meanwhile, somewhat smaller blockchains managed to achieve greater performance. For instance, EOS is able to process 1,200 TPS and Tron can already handle 2,000 TPS.

Transactions per second comparison between top cryptos

What about Casper?

Buterin built a whole roadmap until 2020, which should lead Ethereum to reaching similar indicators of such payment giants as Visa, which processes 24,000 operations per second. The program includes a transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm, network sharding, as well as the introduction of the second-layer solutions: Plasma and Raiden.

The PoS consensus algorithm is expected to make transactions cheaper and accelerate the production of new blocks, while Layer 2 solutions are supposed to significantly increase the scalability of Ethereum.

The concept of sharding is another innovation that represents a modified network architecture, with the blockchain dividing nodes into smaller independent elements called shards. The latter has its own transaction history log that handles only its own transactions, thus decreasing the loading on the network.

In an interview with CoinSpice, Buterin shared the details of two long-term schemes, which, according to him, are now being worked on by the Ethereum team and are set to help scale the network. One of them implies the use of the so-called shadow chain, whereby the computation process takes place off-chain, but state transition functions are being committed back to the mainchain after 100 blocks.

With this approach, the network is validated selectively, and the validator who confirms a block guarantees its authenticity with his/her deposit. In case he/she is mistaken, the funds are burned. Buterin called this scheme the interactive computation game approach. The diagram below explains the difference between the two approaches.

Under the second option, zk-STARKs (i.e., Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge) are being proposed, which allow for verification of the data without revealing the content to the validator. Layer 2 solutions are good for network scaling, but their development is a laborious and time-consuming process, while there exist temporary ways to increase the throughput of the Ethereum blockchain, as Buterin claims:

“In the long-term we expect that the data layer for these schemes to be Ethereum 2.0 itself. Until Ethereum 2.0 exists what you have is first of all the existing Ethereum chain but the existing Ethereum chain is already basically 100% full and it has been full for a while. And we could do marginal things to increase its scalability but it’s still relatively expensive and so there’s other strategy you could consider. To do some short-term things is basically to just use these second-tier blockchains as extra data layers.”

Buterin brings Bitcoin Cash into the discussion

Buterin explained his choice of the BCH blockchain because of its optimal throughput of 53 KB per second, which is almost seven times higher than that of Ethereum. Moreover, connecting BCH to the main network is possible in a short time due to its user-friendly interface. According to Buterin:

“You have a computation layer from Ethereum side and a data layer from BCH side. Symbiosis where there can be offloading of data from Ethereum into Bitcoin Cash.”

In addition, BCH network commissions are lower than those of BTC and ETH, which makes it impossible to use these to solve the scalability problem. Buterin said:

“We have Premium ones [blockchains] — Bitcoin and Ethereum basically, that have this high relatively level of security but they also have higher transaction costs because more people want to do stuff on them, and then you have this kind of lower tier blockchains where you have lower security but transaction space is cheaper which is fine because you have fewer nodes verifying it.”

As claimed by the founder of Ethereum, the network already has the necessary mechanisms for verifying Bitcoin Cash blocks, with BTC Relay being an Ethereum contract that stores Bitcoin block headers. He adds that what is left to start working with BCH is redirecting the service tools to its blockchain.

And finally what makes BCH attractive as a scalability solution for Ethereum is what Buterin calls the positive attitude of the BCH community toward “people using their chain for whatever they want as long as they pay the tx fees.”

Any alternatives for Ethereum?

As an alternative, Ethereum founders are also considering Ethereum Classic (ETC), where the block confirmation time is 14 seconds.

The only issue that needs to be resolved to work with the ETC blockchain is the lack of reliable applications on the Ethereum platform confirming the block verification on the ETC blockchain. However, there are almost ready-made solutions to enable the operation of ETH smart contracts, and developers can save a lot on the costs associated with gas. As Buterin said:

“There are changes that ETC could adopt to tip the balance. Reducing the gas costs for calldata (as ETH is planning to) would increase its data rate, and adding flyclient support could reduce gas costs of header verification to a level sufficiently low that the ETH chain can handle it cheaply (note that for these constructions, header verification being delayed by even a day is no big deal, so flyclient is perfect here).”

Some members of the community suggest using the Litecoin (LTC), Dash and Steem platforms, but so far, the team has reportedly not sent any offers of cooperation to the abovementioned competitors.

Criticism of Buterins proposal

Most of the cryptocurrency community reacted to the Ethereum leader’s proposal with great skepticism. André Neves, editor of Komenco Blog and Lightwork, pointed out many flaws in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to address the scalability problem on Twitter:

“‘The main weakness of the BCH chain is its 10 minute block time’. What about the low hashrate? Central controlling authorities? Extremely large blocks that lead to constant reorgs?”

And Erik Wall, an adviser of the Human Rights Foundation and the creator of the exchange platform Cinnober, called such a decision dangerous:

“> The main weakness of the BCH chain is its 10 minute block time Uhh @VitalikButerin what about the weakness that it can be 51% attacked single-handedly by most BTC pools?”

Judging by the statistics presented on the website crypto51.com, one hour of attack on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain would cost a hacker around $20,000, while for Ethereum this, figure would be $120,000. Other users took the Ethereum leader’s announcement as unwillingness to develop the project, while some of them even predicted the platform’s collapse. Federico Tenga, co-founder of the Chainside payment system, wrote on Twitter:

“Lovely, ETH and BCH helping each other to collapse faster.”

However, the founders of Ethereum assess the state and prospects of the network quite optimistically. For instance, back in June, another Ethereum co-founder, Joseph Lubin, claimed that Ethereum has “already scaled quite significantly.” Moreover, according to Buterin, the prospect of increasing the scalability by 1,000 times is more than real. However, it is necessary to implement several solutions proposed by him under the Ethereum 2.0 program, which will not happen before 2020. He said on Twitter:

“9. Blockchains of the future with proof of stake and sharding will be thousands of times more efficient, and so the efficiency sacrifices of putting things on a chain will become more and more acceptable.”

According to Buterin, the work on the adaptation of two BCH and ETC blockchains for the subsequent connection of them to Ethereum data layers should be started right now. This will help scale the platform even before its transition to sharding.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/virgin-bitcoin-most-in-demand-crypto-that-is-regulated-differently,"In a world where the global crypto community continues to face a growing number of regulatory hurdles with each passing day, the term “virgin Bitcoin” is starting to become more common among digital currency enthusiasts. However, it is of utmost importance to clarify what this term actually means and the significance it carries.

According to Dave Jevans, the CEO of CipherTrace, virgin Bitcoins are essentially BTC tokens that do not have a transaction (TX) record associated with them. As a result of this, coins lack a defined attribution history, making them extremely useful for money launderers as well as other miscreants looking to mask the source of their illegally procured funds. Not only that, even the recipient typically has no traditional means of verifying the origin of the funds in question since virgin btc cannot be linked with any wallet or other cold storage entity.

Also, the Bitcoin blockchain serves as a decentralized ledger that allows anyone to follow the transaction history of a particular token with the touch of a button. For example, each Bitcoin carries with it a cryptographically provable history that contains a detailed record of ownership and transaction data associated with the token. Simply put, if a particular Bitcoin has been used to process even a single illegal activity in the past, all of its subsequent transactions will be tainted. This, according to Jevans, is one of the main reasons why certain cyber-savvy criminals go to such great lengths to launder their cryptocurrencies before putting them to use.

Virgin Bitcoins on G-20 agenda

With all of the aforementioned information in mind, it is important to consider that, at the recently concluded G-20 summit that took place in Osaka, Japan, the core governing committee agreed to adopt the standards of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — which are conventionally used in relation to fiat currencies — even for digital assets. On the subject, Cointelegraph spoke with Flex Yang, CEO of Babel Finance, who shared his thoughts on the issue at hand:

“When these standards go into effect, interexchange transactions will require transparency regarding senders and receivers of cryptocurrency. This opens doors to a wide berth of scrutiny as regulators probe different ledgers to determine what wallets participated in illicit crypto exchanges, hacks, etc. Bitcoin remains of interest to institutional investors, but their threshold for risk is much lower. With uncertainty as to how the crypto world will conform to the FATF standards, many traditional investors feel it best to air on the side of caution.”

Yang then went on to highlight the importance of virgin Bitcoins and how tainted crypto can become extremely tough to use when dealing with regulated financial institutions. For example, he pointed out that, if there existed even a sliver of proof that a particular Bitcoin had been used for shady activities in the past, that token could very well be seized or held indeterminately by regulators for a variety of legal reasons.“It’s like trying to deposit money in a bank that is from a drug cartel or criminal enterprise; banks will refuse to process transactions,” Yang explained.

So is it just virgin Bitcoin that people are after?

As things stand, it appears as though a whole host of institutional investors are primarily looking to source virgin BTC, even though a uniform regulatory code applies to other altcoins as well. Simply put, nearly any currency — be it digital or fiat — can be used to facilitate illegal transactions. However, since Bitcoin offers its owners more transparency when compared to hard cash, virgin coins can be painted clean in a much easier manner.

Additionally, it appears as though the Chinese government is particularly interested in virgin Bitcoins, even though it has not outwardly expressed any sort of leniency for individuals who may be in possession of these digital entities. According to Yang, China has yet to take any major action against its sprawling mining community. This is quite noteworthy because the demand for virgin Bitcoin seems to be spiking rapidly across the globe, and it seems as though mining operations in China are continuing to thrive and grow with each passing day. Yang then went on to say:

“The buyers are from US and other more regulated areas. China's miners are just sellers….. Buyers may be pursuing these coins because of their novelty as well as the perceived ease-of-compliance in regulatory uncertainty. In truth, virgin Bitcoin might not benefit family funds or intuitions/individuals making the purchase. Still, there is clearly more confidence in virgin (or white) coin and it continues to fetch high premiums as a result.”

What is the problem with using Bitcoin that has a shady past?

At the very heart of the issue, Jevans notes that BTC that has a dark transaction history attached to it has more often than not been procured through a host of illegal pathways, such as global money laundering exercises or terrorism-related activities. And even after a particular token has been exchanged a large number of times, its payment trail can still quite easily be traced by investigators — thereby putting the owner at risk. The CEO of CipherTrace expounded on the topic by saying:

“Dark Tx histories also impede the fungibility of the btc if these tokens have a lower value. This a big concern for hedge funds that are concerned that their entire fund could be tainted by a few bad tokens. While this is less likely to affect those holding small amounts, larger traders could potentially, and unwittingly, hold larger amounts of stolen assets, lowering the value of their investment pool through association.”

Essentially, it appears as though even a single shady transaction can render a coin or token unclean. However, what is interesting is the fact that criminal Bitcoin can be sanitized by local governments by them selling such commodities after making a clear note of their past transactional history. The best example of this is when the United States Marshals Service held a sealed bid auction back in 2018 for a total of 3,813 Bitcoins (estimated to be worth $51.5 million at the time).

Virgin Bitcoin data worth taking a note of

As per CipherTrace’s crypto intelligence team, over 75% of all transactions taking place on the black market are facilitated using Bitcoin.

A large number of cyber criminals make use of techniques such as coin mixing to try and sever the path attached to a particular digital currency. And while it may still be possible to view the transaction history of a given token using advanced cryptographic methods, coin mixing makes the process extremely complicated.

Russian conspirators involved with the alleged 2016 election hack in the U.S. were presumed to have funded their operations in part via a host of different Bitcoin mining operations based across the globe.

In a similar vein, Jevans told Cointelegraph that virgin Bitcoins were also used to fund the registration payment for dcleaks.com.

CipherTrace’s studies have revealed that the recent crackdown carried out by the Iranian government on its mining sector were premeditated. Not only that, there are strong indicators suggesting that the local regime is currently making use of the confiscated mining gear for its personal gains.

Lastly, Jevans also commented on the premiums associated with virgin Bitcoin and how they differ from premiums related to regular BTC. On the subject, he was quoted as saying:

“When we investigated BestMixer in November of 2018 they charged 5% for their Gamma level which was supposedly virgin coins. CipherTrace research revealed that these tokens were not in fact unused rather they had been cleansed via exchange hopping. This certainly raised the visibility and value of freshly mined coins. Moreover, the falling regulatory curtain is raising the value of clean coins as it becomes harder to launder funds through regulated exchanges.”

Additionally, according to Yang, premiums associated with virgin Bitcoin currently lay around the 10% mark. However, established players who have been operating within this domain for many years now are known to markup virgin coins by over 30%.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/full-house-crypto-cards-show-a-strong-hand-in-2019,"Until recently, cryptocurrency debit cards appeared to fall short of expectations. Despite many failed efforts in recent years, crypto debit cards are enjoying a second wind thanks to a surge in crypto prices over the summer. With some of the crypto world’s biggest names launching crypto debit cards, Cointelegraph takes a look at the latest updates in the burgeoning payments sector.

What are cryptocurrency debit cards and how do they work?

Cryptocurrency debit cards are almost exactly the same as the bank card you carry around every day in your wallet, except for the fact that you can use them to deposit and convert cryptocurrencies. Crypto debit cards represent the transitional stage that cryptocurrencies are currently evolving through. Merchants — for the most part — aren’t ready to accept payments for everyday items and services in crypto, along with the fact that many cryptocurrencies still face issues with transaction time. Consequently, many exchanges only offer the possibility to trade cryptocurrencies for other existing cryptocurrencies, presenting an issue for investors looking to convert their tokens to fiat.

In this respect, crypto debit cards present a happy middle ground for both investors and merchants alike. Payments with a crypto card does not require the merchant to have any technology to accept cryptocurrency payments, as they use the existing Visa/Mastercard infrastructure widely used by businesses the world over. Crypto cards either convert currency seamlessly for the payment or give the user the opportunity to transfer it into a dedicated fiat account for payments.

New Litecoin Foundation partnership rolls out new card

The Litecoin Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing and promoting blockchain technology, announced that it has teamed up with Bibox Exchange and the blockchain firm Ternio to roll out its own crypto debit card.

The new card, dubbed “BlockCard,” will be released as a joint venture by the companies and, for the meantime, is restricted to U.S. customers only. According to a post published by the Litecoin Foundation, BlockCard will enable customers to spend cryptocurrency both online and in-store worldwide. It might not come as a surprise that the most prominent cryptocurrency available to service users is Litecoin (LTC). Customers will also be able to use Bibox Exchange’s and Ternio’s native tokens, Bibox Token (BIX) and Ternio (TERN) respectively.

While Bibox Exchange is set to act as the custodian of users’ funds and to leverage north of $200 million worth of cryptocurrency trading volume, Ternio aims to provide a dedicated blockchain platform.

Litecoin creator and managing director of the Litecoin Foundation, Charlie Lee, said the card launch represents an opportunity to get more people spending Litecoin:

“This is an exciting partnership for us as it furthers the Litecoin Foundation’s mission to create more use cases for spending Litecoin in everyday life. Leveraging Ternio’s BlockCard platform with Bibox’s exchange engine gives Litecoin holders unparalleled access to use their LTC at merchants around the world.”

Although a cursory glance back at recent efforts to launch crypto debit cards may prove a sobering experience for most entrepreneurs, Ternio founder and CEO Daniel Gouldman told Cointelegraph via email that the payments industry is there for the taking:

“The payments industry is currently $4 trillion a year on its way to being $5.5 trillion. Commerce literally is about exchanging value. More and more people are figuring out that cryptocurrencies hold some tremendous advantages over traditional systems which are archaic. When you have JP Morgan, Facebook, Mitsubishi bank, Samsung and other multinationals all employing a cryptocurrency of some kind — it’s clear that not only tech savvy bitcoin enthusiast/anarchists see the value. Cryptocurrencies are going to revolutionize payments.”

Since Bitcoin’s resurgence in the summer of 2019, many top cryptocurrencies are riding the back of a bullish market. Consequently, the launch of several new crypto card initiatives isn’t really that surprising. Despite an increasingly crowded market, Gouldman thinks that BlockCard has what it takes to outshine its competitors:

“Unlike other crypto cards — they force you into fiat at the moment of your deposit which means you’re carrying around a glorified prepaid card that you could buy at Walgreens or Wal-Mart. They charge you for the deposit directly — undercut the value of your asset (by a lot) and then you’re stuck in cash with no easy way to get back into crypto. We allow the users to stay in crypto so they can easily withdrawal whenever they want and the process is seamless.”

Historically, the crypto community has complained about high fees and regulation issues in connection to previous efforts to launch crypto debit cards. Gouldman said that the Ternio team shares the community’s disappointment and has developed BlockCard with the goal of giving customers the best deal possible:

“There was this thought process that the banks were ripping people off and it really soured people on large institutional players. But we traded this lack of trust in banks and other fintech companies for crypto companies that are gouging people. It’s really disgusting. If a company isn’t giving you a square deal — it’s because their values are very different than certainly ours but also — I suspect most consumers. We’re not perfect but our thesis is about lowering costs and making it more convenient. [...] And creating competition is good because it’s good for markets and good for consumers. We’re pro-consumer. That’s who we are and that’s who we’re always going to be.”

In the crypto world, competition is tough, with a lot of companies vying for the top spot in a niche sector. However, Gouldman said that the spate of card launches is a sign that things are changing for the better:

“There are a lot of great card companies out there and I’m excited for the entire industry. We won’t and shouldn’t live in a world filled with only one option; more options means consumer choice and forces innovation. The industry hasn’t seen crypto really break out for payments but it’s really about to. Write that down. Buy the t-shirt. It’s about to get real.”

Coinbase Card rolled out in six European countries

On June 11, Coinbase launched its Visa debit card in six European countries. Customers in Spain, France, Italy, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands will be able to sync the cards to their Coinbase accounts to spend their cryptocurrencies at any merchant that accepts Visa cards. This latest offering from Coinbase comes in two formats: a mobile app for iOS or Android, and a physical card that can be used to make fiat withdrawals from ATMs. News of a European launch followed the April announcement of Coinbase Card, a service previously limited to United Kingdom customers.

Powered by customers’ Coinbase account crypto balances, Coinbase Card allows transactions worldwide in multiple cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. According to the press release, cryptocurrencies stored in users’ account are instantly converted to fiat currency at the moment of purchase. The card will also be supported by an app that enables service users to select which crypto wallets are used when spending. The app also provides receipts and transaction summaries.

Coinbase’s European offering will also allow customers to choose which cryptocurrency to make payments with, which Coinbase converts to cash for a fee.

At the time, news of the UK crypto debit card launch received a mixed response from online members of the crypto community. While some advocate that this is a necessary step towards greater adoption, others noted that the restriction to U.K.-based customers and reports of transaction fees could prevent the product from taking off.

Coinbase Card is issued, authorized and regulated by the electronic money institution Paysafe Financial Services Limited.

Coinbase cancels Shift Bitcoin debit card

Coinbase’s previous efforts to maintain a crypto debit card service have not always been so successful. Coinbase’s Shift Bitcoin debit card reportedly ceased operations on April 11, according to an email allegedly from the Shift team that was posted on Reddit on Feb. 18. The shutdown of Shift was the latest blow to the crypto debit card sector, following a number of high-profile companies also throwing in the towel.

Launched in November 2015, Shift was part of what initially seemed a promising new innovation: cards that allowed users to spend Bitcoin (BTC) via the existing Visa debit infrastructure. Although there are numerous companies in different countries still offering them, their much-touted global appeal has waned.

According to the screenshot uploaded to Reddit, the Shift BTC card service terminated on April 11, 2019. The company did not give an official response stating the reason for the shutdown of the product. The company did assure current service users that the product will function as usual up until the advertised cut-off date.

Comments on social media indicated that a lack of demand was the reason behind Coinbase’s decision to withdraw the Shift BTC card.

Where did it all initially go wrong for BTC cards?

While the summer of 2019 is proving to be a popular time for card launches, the market was not always so buoyant. One of the most prominent setbacks for the sector occurred in January, when Visa ended its relationship with debit card provider WaveCrest. At the time, the decision from the payment titan set the cat among the pigeons in the crypto community. The company later revealed that the relationship had been terminated due to WaveCrest violating Visa’s policies:

""We can confirm that WaveCrest’s Visa membership is being terminated due to continued non-compliance with our operating rules. All of WaveCrest’s Visa card programmes will be closed as a result. “Visa has other approved card programmes that use fiat funds converted from cryptocurrency in a number of jurisdictions. The termination of WaveCrest’s Visa membership does not affect these other products.”

This is not the only time that payments giants have created uncertainty for crypto debit card providers. Back in October 2018, Finance Magnates reported that both Mastercard and Visa would classify cryptocurrency and initial coin offerings (ICOs) as “high risk.” Quoting undisclosed sources, the publication reported that a ban would be applied to brokers operating from “unregulated or loosely regulated environments.” Unfortunately this description would spell disaster for many crypto debit cards, as there is no universal policy for regulating crypto payments. Consequently, many debit card companies offering crypto services would appear as not having applied the necessary due diligence to their business.

Ex-Visa exec launches own card

Although Mastercard and Visa have a lukewarm approach to cryptocurrencies, the same cannot be said for ex-Visa exec Steven Parker, who now heads Crypterium, a crypto payment firm that announced it has shipped around 4,000 crypto debit cards since its launch.

The company, based in Estonia, launched the Crypterium Card on June 12, offering users a prepaid card compatible with several major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and USD Coin, along with Crypterium’s own CRPT token.

Having delivered 3,736 cards to roughly 70 countries in the week following the product’s launch, Crypterium said it was experiencing “booming demand” on the back of the BTC price surge and fledgling bull market. Crypterium co-founder and chief operating officer, Austin Kimm, spoke to Cointelegraph through email about how crypto debit card providers had had a tough time in the past:

“Timing is everything. Being the first is not always the best idea as the world needs to be ready to accept a shift in thinking. Many people couldn't see the benefit of the internet when it first launched. Until now, crypto debit cards have had to fight on multiple fronts.”

Kimm named a number of factors that had previously held back the growth of crypto debit cards, including price volatility and institutional investment domination:

“A dramatically falling crypto market (by value) limited owner desire to spend what is probably a lot less in value than it was when they first bought or received it. Lack of trust by a wider community limiting the spread of currency. The vast bulk of Crypto owners bought their crypto as an investment, very few earned it as income (miners apart) compounding the lack of incentive to spend crypto.”

Although many still consider Visa and Mastercard to be the gold standard in terms of global customer reach, Kimm said that this belief is misplaced:

“Many companies might say they are able to issue their cards worldwide, but it is simply not true. Visa and Mastercard have a regional strategy limiting the reach of card crypto card issuers. The history of TenX is interesting in that they had a regional issuing capability for Singapore, but shipped cards worldwide. This led to Visa blocking their services completely and in the process destroying the value of their card issuing partner wave crest holdings. This regional strategy means that all cards are being issued in the same places, USA, UK, Singapore. But where is cryptocurrency having the greatest impact? Latin America, Asia and many developing markets. The use case in developing markets is significantly greater than that in developed markets.”

Kimm said that its strong customer base in the Asia-Pacific region influenced his decision to partner with Union Pay International:

“They are huge in the developing markets, and they have no regional issuance restrictions. That means that with one single partnership, Crypterium can issue cards to any citizen in any country in the world (we still require usual KYC information) reaching those users that need us most and whom everybody else has ignored. Users that will want to use the card for everyday transactions.”

Wirex

After the initial fiasco involving Visa cancelling its working relationship with WaveCrest in January, many companies found themselves in the awkward position of attempting to offer crypto debit card services without actually having a card provider themselves. One company, Wirex, found itself this predicament, however, due to the fact that the company had begun to seek out relationships with other card providers prior to WaveCrest’s collapse, Wirex soon landed on its feet. Having ridden out the whole debacle, Wirex co-founder Dmitry Lazarichev spoke to Cointelegraph about the intricacies involved in launching a crypto debit card:

“There are several challenges when trying to launch a crypto supported card in every country. First and foremost, although over-simplifying its classification, the entity issuing the card and accounts should be licensed by the appropriate local regulator as an e-money/money transmitter institution or the local regulatory equivalent. “Second, a ‘BIN sponsor’ is required — that is a company which holds principal membership with a card payment network - Visa and Mastercard being the best-known and having widest coverage. In January 2018, WaveCrest ceased operating under Visa’s network, which essentially stopped all companies overnight who relied on WaveCrest’s card services. Wirex was one of very few companies, if not the only one, to find another card issuer and BIN sponsor, in Contis Financial Services.”

Lazarichev added that gaining approval as an authorized agent of Contis, along with successfully passing a number or due diligence tests, gave their reputation a boost after the initial knockback with WaveCrest:

“We had been approved as an authorised agent of Contis, an FCA e-money license holder, which helped in terms of credibility to secure the card issuance. This required thorough checks of our policies for KYC [Know Your Customer] and AML [Anti-Money Laundering] purposes, specifically processes and controls. We successfully passed the audit for PCI- DSS which we were awarded later during the year (we are level 1 certified — the highest in the industry). We are not ICO funded. Traditional institutions are historically wary of working with ICO funded companies.”

Australia’s bullish environment proves stable for crypto cards

Despite the struggles facing many crypto debit card companies in Europe and beyond, BTC.com.au launched its own Bitcoin card. Australia, famous for its bullish approach to crypto, has proven to be a healthy environment for this latest crypto venture. BTC.com.au CEO Danny Ariti spoke to Cointelegraph, stating that BTC.com.au has seen an increase in customer demand for the product since its official launch last year:

“We've personally seen a massive uptake and interest in our cards since officially launching the program. We believe this to be the result of making the card an easy and intuitive product with a focus on removing many of the pain points associated with other cash out options. Cards can be loaded with multiple coins with support for additional coins constantly being added, funds are instantly loaded onto the card when a transaction is made - there is no waiting for clearing times that you'd see with regular cash out options, all made more appealing to users with cards operating outside of the traditional banking system.”

The BTC.com.au CEO emphasised that a lack of crypto understanding is partly to blame for the lack of more widespread adoption along with the current requirement to rely on third party companies and investors:

“One of the main challenges is institutional and mainstream company pressures and restrictions. This is mainly due to a lack of understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. We don't believe this to be limited to only a lack of understanding, but also a fear of the exceptional concept that is cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. As we rely on third party companies and institutions in order to develop these card products, their restrictions in the understanding of cryptocurrency is prevalent. An example of this, specifically within Australia, is the $999 limit attached to our card program. This is a result of insurance companies evaluating businesses operating in this space as 'high-risk' making it difficult for cryptocurrency-related businesses to obtain the necessary insurances to meet the regulatory requirements to have these limits raised. With widespread use of the cards, we're hoping that this high-risk view will decrease.”

Ariti also touched on the damage dealt to the sector by Mastercard and Visa’s policies towards cryptocurrency businesses, but remained cautiously optimistic about renewed interest from card issuers:

“The industry has seen some curve balls thrown at it with many of the earlier card programs operating on the Mastercard and VISA networks having their programs pulled as result of cryptocurrency-related businesses being heavily scrutinised and being placed in a high-risk industry category. While in Australia we presently only have the ability to operate over the domestic eftpos card network, we're now seeing renewed interest from card issuers potentially approving new cryptocurrency card programs back onto these global payment networks.”

Overall, Ariti maintains a positive outlook for the future adoption of BTC debit cards, commenting that the potential benefits and ease-of-use, together with the eventual merchant acceptance of cryptocurrency, will win out in the end:

“We are optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency cards; they allow users to easily integrate cryptocurrency into their everyday lives with little learning curve by taking a new technology and coupling it with a familiar system and user experience, essentially bridging the gap between the 'old’ and 'new'. This of course is all part of a much larger movement until more merchants begin natively accepting cryptocurrency, but this small stepping stone will eventually translate into a much larger revolutionary leap as adoption continues.”

Despite 2018’s prolonged bear market, it’s clear from the recent spate of launches and service expansions from existing providers that entrepreneurs in the crypto industry see opportunities to exploit a potentially fertile market. Much like any business environment, the crypto world has witnessed its fair share of egos and cut-throat competition. For now, there appears to be a certain sense of shared optimism and community spirit regarding the potential for crypto debit cards to facilitate wider adoption of digital currencies. Although more companies are throwing their hats into the ring, there are still plenty of options for card providers to attract customers, with competitive fees, increasingly diverse coin portfolios and user experience all being low-hanging fruit for potential clients. However, as both 2019’s so-called bull run enters a bout of serious volatility and Facebook’s Libra project faces mounting regulatory difficulties, it remains to be seen how institutions, customers and centralized card providers across the crypto sector will react.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptokart-another-indian-crypto-exchange-shuts-down-operations,"Founder of Indian cryptocurrency exchange Cryptokart Gaurang Poddar announced that his company is shutting down in a LinkedIn post published last week.

In his post, Poddar described the shutdown of the exchange as “difficult, given the hard work we've put in” but concluded that overall the experience was positive and that he was proud of the platform and seemed intent on remaining in the field, asking, “If you know anyone interested in launching their own exchange, please let me know.”

Poddar announced that he was looking for opportunities in product management, and asked anyone who knew about such opportunities to contact him. Poddar launched Cryptokart in 2017, roughly one year and nine months ago.

The news comes after Indian crypto exchange Koinex ceased operations in June and in May Coinome — another crypto exchange operating in the country — announced the halt of its services. Both exchanges cited the hostile regulatory environment as the cause of their shutdowns.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, Indian lawmakers have reportedly proposed to enforce a 10-year jail term for citizens who deal with cryptocurrencies. The new tough crypto regulation is part of a recently proposed draft bill called “Banning Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019.”",,https://www.thestatesman.com/business/no-blanket-crypto-trading-ban-yet-india-1502780102.html,"Despite banking restrictions put in place by the Reserve Bank of India, the country has not put any blanket ban on trading in cryptocurrencies yet, the government has clarified.

Responding to questions in the Rajya Sabha on whether the government has prohibited cryptocurrency in the country, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur this week said the answer was no.

“Presently, there is no separate law for dealing with issues relating to cryptocurrencies. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies, such as RBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities, etc. take action as per the relevant existing laws,” the Minister said.

“Similarly, police/courts take action on IPC (Indian Penal Code) offences. Further, in view of the risks and dangers associated with cryptocurrencies, (the) government and RBI have been issuing advisories, press releases and circulars to the public,” he added.

Earlier the Reserve Bank of India issued a circular banning regulated entities from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect on July 6 last year, Bitcoin.com reported on Friday.

But a draft bill for banning cryptocurrency has been in the works for some time with Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg leading the exercise.

According to the draft “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019”, holding, selling or dealing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin could soon land you in jail for 10 years.

The draft has proposed a 10-year prison sentence for persons who “mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies.

Besides making it completely illegal, the bill makes holding of cryptos a non-bailable offence.

Per the report, Energy Minister Homayoon Ha’eri announced that, while the tariff scheme has been finalized, it is awaiting approval from the Cabinet of Iran — a governmental body consisting of various ministers and other officials chosen by the president.

While Ha’eri did not elaborate on the exact price scheme, he stated that the price is dependent on market factors such as fuel prices in the Persian Gulf.

The head of Iran Electrical Industry Syndicate, Ali Bakhshi, previously proposed a price of $0.07 per kilowatt hour for cryptocurrency miners. Electricity in Iran is currently very cheap due to government subsidies; one kilowatt hour of electricity currently costs $0.05, with power being cheaper in the agricultural and industrial sectors.

To put these prices in context, Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, the Energy Ministry spokesman for the power department, previously stated that the production of a single Bitcoin (BTC) uses about $1,400 in state subsidies.

The Financial Tribune reports that mining one Bitcoin reportedly consumes as much electricity as 24 buildings in Tehran do in one year.

Today’s news follows an announcement from the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), in which the banks governor Abdol Hemmati claimed that the CBI was planning to authorize cryptocurrency mining.

Similar to today’s statements from Energy Minister Ha’eri, Hemmati said that a planned law will require crypto mining in Iran to abide with the price of electricity for export, rather than allowing miners to use the heavily subsidized internal energy grid.

Also today, Deputy President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration Jamal Arounaghi announced that the agency has not yet issued licenses for the import of cryptocurrency mining equipment. While a tariff scheme exists, the final decision on licensure awaits approval from the government.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-crypto-crimes-cost-228b-since-july-2017,"The South Korean Justice Ministry estimates that cryptocurrency-related crimes have caused 2.69 trillion won (about $2.28 billion) of financial damage between July 2017 and June 2019.

According to a July 21 report by English-language local media The Korea Herald, the ministry claimed that 132 cryptocurrency-related criminals and fraudsters had been indicted and detained, with another 288 indicted without physical detention during the aforementioned time frame.

The report states that, while Justice Minister Park Sang-kim has ordered stern measures against cryptocurrency criminals, a lack of clear regulations on cryptocurrency exchanges has led to an increase in the use of quasi-anonymous or opaque accounts.

Despite a ban on anonymous crypto exchange accounts in January last year, minor exchanges reportedly started using so-called beehive accounts to circumvent the regulation.

Exchanges employing these kind of accounts keep user funds on their corporate bank accounts, keeping the identity of their users private. The government reportedly proposed to end the practice, but a court halted the initiative ruling that it would be inappropriate for the government to close the exchange’s corporate bank accounts.

Online casinos and betting sites have proliferated since the first of their kind came on the scene in 1994. Thanks to the convenience of playing from home, the allure of winning real money, and a degree of privacy, these popular sites continue to evolve. There have been major problems, though, regarding perceived fairness and randomness of play. Blockchain technology offers a solution in provably fair gaming, taking trust out of the picture almost entirely.

Mistrust of Old Models

Consumer mistrust of online gaming sites has been understandably high in the past, as the relationship between house and player is often shrouded in slick talk and foggy uncertainty. A 2013 survey of online gamblers showed that 91.5% of the 10,000+ interviewed wanted some kind of reputable, third party report to guarantee fairness in play. Things like hashing and open source, blockchain-based code are now making this possible.

What Is ‘Provably Fair’?

Provably fair means that the mechanisms used to generate results on a gaming platform can be vetted by the user independently for authenticity and randomness. Prior to the rise of blockchain solutions, users had to simply trust that their online casino was generating results without altering them according to the player’s bet, or some other arbitrary factor.

The house could stand to win a lot more by knowing how players bet, and purposefully broadcasting results not favorable to the user. With blockchain-based gambling, however, all the information about every single bet and result, and how the outcomes were arrived at, is stored on a public ledger, and these algorithms can be verified by users.

Instead of relying on a website’s bold claim of “third party-verified gaming” players can now prove this fairness to themselves using randomly generated seeds and hashes, as well as verification tools unaffiliated with the site itself. While the words “provably fair” in and of themselves do not necessarily denote a trustless system (some sites can still “rig” outcomes in subtle ways if users aren’t careful), this innovation does take things leagues beyond “just trust us.”

How It Works

Let’s say online gamer Susan wants to play some dice games. She heads to a provably fair site and places her bet. Before her bet is placed, however, the site’s server provides her with a hash (a near impossible-to-reverse, fixed-length output scrambling of data) of the predetermined server-side result or outcome of the roll (server seed). Now, Susan’s browser — or Susan herself — provides a random seed (client seed) which modifies the predetermined hash to something neither she nor the gaming site can predict. When all this has taken place, the dice are rolled.

After Susan has finished her gaming session, she can check the hashes provided by the site against the seeds she provided, using a now unhashed server seed. Via verification tools, she can be sure that the outcomes of her rolls were generated both according to the gaming site’s original seed (unchangeable after being decided prior to the bet or roll), and her own random client seed (existing only in her browser) via a predetermined algorithm.

In essence, the process is like someone writing a math problem on a piece of paper (such as 2 + 2 = ?) but with one of the values written in invisible ink (2 + ? = ?) This person then folds the paper and places it in another person’s pocket. This other person removes the paper, and now secretly writes a new number in black ink, crossing out the first, visible integer. Both people can then examine the paper with identical “magic flashlights.” The intended result “4” can be understood via the original magic ink value of “2,” but now must be adjusted based on the newly placed first value in black ink. In this way, neither party is able to predict the result without the magic lights (open source code, seeds, and hashes) showing the invisible ink (unhashed server seed) and newly written number in black (client seed).

Though much more complex than the simple illustration given above, this is the basic idea. In provably fair gaming, nobody has to trust anyone else about the outcome being random and fair, as long as the underlying mechanisms are transparent.

Transparency Is Paramount

As alluded to earlier, not all sites claiming to be provably fair actually are, so it is important to exercise caution. Most online gamblers and gamers are not programmers, and wouldn’t know how to verify these things without some useful tools to help. Reputable sites include links to open source tools by which to check seeds and verify results. Oftentimes these tools are found on the sites themselves, and utilize the client’s browser. Beyond this, the algorithm used to generate randomness itself should also be clearly defined and open source.

In cases where this information is not transparent, platforms can potentially gather client browser data, and analyze the gambling patterns of individual players to avoid payouts. This is why a gaming site’s transparency and soundness of underlying mechanism is of utmost importance. It’s also why it’s good to manually generate new seeds with each play or session.

Less Trust Equates to More Reliability

Provably fair gaming and betting are continuing to evolve with the aid of blockchain innovation. Newly developing ideas such as atomic, on-chain betting would remove trust elements from transactions even further. As it stands, even on provably fair, completely reliable sites the player is still required to trust that they will indeed receive their payout after a randomly-generated outcome has given them a win. Using the opcode OP_Checkdatasig, however, it may be possible to remove this element completely, automating trustless gaming from start to finish.

Bitcoin.com’s Bitcoin Cash Games web portal is a provably fair gaming site that offers video poker, roulette, blackjack and more so players can wager BCH in a high stakes environment. We can 100 percent assure that our gaming platform can be played with confidence and that all deals are entirely fair. “The reason that we can guarantee provably fair gaming is that your web browser supplies a random number that we must incorporate into the random number generator in a provably consistent way,” explains Cashgames.Bitcoin.com.

Bridge to the Future: Fair Money and Fair Play

As online gaming — and finance itself — continue to evolve, permissionless systems are revolutionizing the way humans conceptualize fairness. Whereas altruistic, trust-based norms have held sway for most of history, it now appears that the best way to build trust might be by removing it completely. That is to say, in creating systems so transparent and understandable that bad actors and scammers will have nowhere to hide.

This is akin to the way people trust a well-tested bridge, and not a blindfolded promise from a stranger of safe passage. There’s always some element of risk, but knowing how the bridge was built, how often it is maintained, and seeing it for oneself is always preferable to being blindfolded and simply invited to walk across a canyon.

The two will sit down together in San Francisco’s historic Jackson Square on July 25, along with seven guests chosen by Sun. They will dine at a location the crypto-entrepreneur says he selected because it “represents the traditional and the upstart—much like the participants in the lunch itself.” Sun paid $4.5 million to win the charity lunch auctioned annually by Buffett. He hopes the meal will “bridge the divide between the blockchain industry and traditional investors” and change the outlook of an investment guru who famously called cryptocurrency “rat poison squared.” (Update: Tron announced July 22 the lunch was postponed because Sun was ill.)

Sun Yuchen, as he’s known in China, is the fourth Chinese businessman to win the right to grab steak and hash browns with Buffett. Unlike his predecessors (in Chinese), Sun, born in 1990 into a life that has coincided with China’s three-decade economic boom, represents the “virtual economy.” The American investment guru, in contrast, has built up most of his $84 billion net worth by investing in businesses with tangible products. Tellingly, he did not invest in tech companies until he took a stake in IBM in 2011.

Their attitude toward spending their wealth also distinguishes the two men. Buffett is known for his frugal manner and still lives in the Nebraska house he bought for $31,500 back in 1958. Sun, meanwhile, “likes to show off the flashy logos of luxury items he bought and cares a lot about his looks, forcing himself to eat only salads to keep fit,” according to a 2015 GQ China profile (in Chinese). Sun said his aim is to show people “my achievements, convincing them that they should talk to me.”

Sun’s crucial timing

Can Buffett, who has famously said he “never invests in a business he cannot understand,” get his head around Sun’s Tron Network? The blockchain platform is meant to allow entertainment content creators to share their work directly with users. A Coindesk report says that more than 64% of the decentralized apps (dapps) on the Tron network involve gambling, according to analytics firm Dapp Review. Users can bet with the Tron token—Tronix, or TRX—and also receive tokens as winnings. In an interview (link in Chinese) earlier this year, Sun said the prevalence of gaming dapps “is in line with our expectations, because the dapps focus on entertaining people.”

Tron’s initial coin offering (ICO) for TRX was completed in September 2017, just as Beijing banned all ICOs and local cryptocurrency exchanges to keep a tighter reign on the financial system. The ban has prompted cryptocurrency founders to shift their operations to Japan and Hong Kong, and, in Sun’s case, San Francisco last year. In 2018, Sun bought the US peer-to-peer file-sharing company BitTorrent, which he plans to integrate with the Tron platform.

Two years after its ICO, Tronix is the 11th largest digital coin in the world by market cap ($1.5 billion)—but that rise might not convince Buffett of its worth.

“Buffett’s investment philosophy is to buy things at a price cheaper than their actual value, so they will have room to appreciate. Whereas, it’s the opposite case for ‘air coin,’” said Shen Meng, founder of Taiwan-based blockchain firm Mahamudra Technologies, using a term invoked by Chinese investors skeptical of the hype around cryptocurrency.

Despite its relative success, Tron has faced challenges, including most recently investor accusations that it failed to act against a scam project that went by a similar name to Tron’s Chinese name, Bo Chang, or Wave Field. The project vanished abruptly last month, leaving investors out some $30 million. In a statement (in Chinese) on China’s Twitter-equivalent Weibo, Sun said Tron reported the case to the police and doesn’t have any ties to the project.

Sun did not reply to questions for this story. A Tron spokesperson referred Quartz to Sun’s Weibo statement when asked about the Wave scheme, and did not reply further.

From university gadfly to blockchain poster child

Like many of his well-educated peers, Sun—who studied history at the prestigious Peking University—was drawn to liberal political ideas. That tendency deepened after a semester abroad in Hong Kong. He organized discussion groups and wrote articles criticizing government and school policies, according to the GQ profile. After the school announced a plan to tailor academic guidance to students according to various categories, such as being low-income or holding “extreme thoughts,” he wrote in a widely circulated online post, the effort was “a cruel thing that tries to institutionalize the tight control of all of PKU’s students. Am I living in Nazi Germany or a respected university?” Such posts helped him shoot to fame online and landed him on the cover of Hong Kong-based magazine Yazhou Zhoukan as a young “opinion leader” (link in Chinese).

“Some might argue that Sun became an opinion leader just to become famous, but I think it was more of a natural result of the overall social atmosphere back then in China. The figures people worshiped at that time were not rich people or entrepreneurs, but rather liberal academics or critics. This has all changed now, of course,” journalist Zhang Jieping, who interviewed Sun for the Yazhou Zhoukan cover story, told Quartz.

It was while studying for a master’s in political economy at the University of Pennsylvania in the US, Sun discovered his passion for the crypto world. He became a paper millionaire by investing early in bitcoin and on his return to Beijing in 2013, he joined Ripple Labs, the US firm that developed the Ripple payment protocol. The same year, he also founded Peiwo, a voice-based social dating app.

Soon he won an endorsement from China’s establishment. In a 2015 interview with state-owned online broadcaster CNTV, Sun said China “has the best environment for entrepreneurs in the world” (in Chinese) while the website also lauded him as “a pioneer of China’s young entrepreneurs.”

Skeptics include Vitalik Buterin

Last year, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the Ethereum platform, and others accused Sun of plagiarism because of similarities between the white paper explaining Tron’s purpose and those of other projects.

Sun denied that the paper was plagiarized.

Meanwhile, ex-BitTorrent executives have expressed significant skepticism about Tron and its plans. “It’s basically a marketing machine layered on a very thin veneer of technology,” Simon Morris, BitTorrent’s former chief strategy officer, told blockchain publication BreakerMag.

Last month, an editorial in the influential Beijing News, (in Chinese) said Sun’s wealth was built on feeding speculation by retail investors who don’t understand digital assets. Sun is famed for his frequent overblown announcements, and other publicity stunts. “The Chinese public has long had a deep distaste towards the behavior of cheating retail investors’ money,” it said. “There’s nothing wrong with becoming rich, but one needs to stick with the basic moral bottom line.”

But Sun has brushed off his critics. In June, when Tron’s market cap temporarily exceeded that of US-listed Sogou, Sun pointed to that as proof his business is more successful (in Chinese) than that of Wang Xiaochuan, CEO of China’s second-largest search engine, Sogou, referencing a televised chat the two men had years earlier. Wang at the time had said he had “not seen any actual results delivered by Sun but only heard boasts from the young entrepreneur.”

“Just as scientists need to publish studies and artists need to create artworks, entrepreneurs also need to prove their value through market cap of their firms. How about taking a look at the market cap of Sogou and Tron after three years and see which company is valued higher? Let’s bet 100 bitcoins on the results!” Sun wrote in a Weibo post (link in Chinese) last month.",,https://www.coindesk.com/using-the-awesome-oscillator-to-find-bitcoin-buy-and-sell-signals,"Few trading tools are as simple and as elegant as the “Awesome Oscillator.”

First developed by American trader Bill Williams, the aptly named Awesome Oscillator (AO) is a momentum indicator that takes advantage of an immediate trend. The AO plots its data using a histogram, similar to how the MACD histogram functions, in that it delivers a buy and sell signal when the bars pass above or below the neutral 0 line.

But that is just one of its main features, the others involve taking stock of an asset’s momentum as well as any immediate change noticed via patterns on the histogram (more on that later).

First, let’s take a quick look at the formula involved:

Median Price = (Price High + Price Low)/2 AO = SMA (Median Price, 5) – SMA (Median Price, 34) SMA – Simple Moving Average.

The AO consists of a 34-period simple moving average, plotted through the middle of the bars and is subtracted from the 5-period simple moving average after taking into account the median price.

The median price is defined by adding the price high and price low of a particular period then dividing that number by 2.

The indicator performs at an optimal level when viewed from the daily and weekly charts, specifically when it comes to crypto, CoinDesk research reveals.

Awesome Oscillator – Weekly chart

Patterns on the histogram can be categorized into two recognizable forms, the “saucer” and “twin peaks.”

The “Saucer” is a pattern for a buy signal occurring when the histogram bars are higher than the zero line. A saucer signal is triggered when there are three consecutive histogram bars above 0, the first two of which must be red (with the second bar being lower than the first), while the third is green and higher than the previous red bar.

BTC produced such a signal beginning July 17 through July 24, 2017, when two red bars formed above the zero line followed by a green bar a week later on July 31. The price of BTC rose from $3,200 by the end of July to near $20,000 in a 5-month period.

“Twin peaks” are also a signal to buy that can be generated when the histogram bars are below the zero line. The signal is produced when two “peaks” are formed below zero and the second peak is closer to the neutral zero line than the first.



A bullish signal flashed by AO following twin peaks on the weekly chart on Dec. 17, 2018, officially marked the end of the bear market. The measurement of twin peaks is taken from July 9 through Dec. 17, 2018.

It’s worth noting that if the pattern is above the neutral line and the second peak is lower than the first then the same conclusion can be drawn for a sell signal as that would mean declining momentum for buyers.

As mentioned previously, the crossover for a histogram bar from below 0 to above is a buy signal and conversely when it passes below 0 from above, that would be an indication to sell.

While the indicator marked an end to 2018’s bear market it also heralded in the official beginning of a new bull run beginning April 22, 2019, on the weekly chart. You can utilize this to your advantage to confirm that the market you are wading into isn’t susceptible to further downside risk.

While some traders prefer multiple indicators for buy signals on their charts, others prefer a more simplistic setup and if that speaks to you then the Awesome Oscillator has got you covered.

Trading trend via Shutterstock; charts by TradingView",2019-07-21 11:00:12+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/libras-biggest-problem,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

Among the barrage of commentary accompanying the Libra circus on Capitol Hill last week was a single short tweet from lawyer Marco Santori that summed up the core problem confronting Facebook’s cryptocurrency project – and, for that matter, any corporate-led effort of its kind.

To understand why Facebook and its 27 Libra partners are in this dilemma, let’s go back to bitcoin’s roots – to the core problem Satoshi Nakamoto sought to solve. It’s right there in the sub-headline of the famous white paper: “electronic cash.”

Satoshi was following a Cypherpunk dream. He/she or they wanted to bring privacy to digital payments, to translate the offline experience of cash transactions into the online realm. The idea: that a user needn’t prove their identity to execute a transaction with anyone else on the Internet – just as there’s no need for me to show a document proving that I’m Michael Casey every time I hand over some dollar notes to someone.

This matters not because everyone using cash or bitcoin is a money launderer evading law enforcement, but because identification poses a real barrier to commerce. If society has an interest in identifying people – as financial law enforcement agents would argue – then we must recognize that this comes with an enormous trade-off in terms of foregone economic activity.

Privacy Matters

Think of the 2 billion “unbanked” adults from the world’s developing countries, the people that Libra, ostensibly, wants to serve. A lack of education, poor credit records, and untrustworthy state-issued ID papers means these people can’t qualify for accounts at local banks (primarily because those local banks are themselves compelled to comply with strict international “know your customer” procedures lest they are cut off by their foreign banking counterparts.) For a very large number of the world’s adults, identity is a very real barrier to commerce.

But you can also think of the billionaires that run Wall Street’s hedge funds or the giant banks and brokerages that trade on their behalf. None of those guys want their identities revealed when they place a buy or sell order for a stock, bond or commodity. The market will just trade against them.

Identity also limits fungibility. As I’ve argued before , money is most useful if its past is unknown. Any single dollar, or single bitcoin, must be worth the same as any other single dollar or bitcoin. But if I receive a dollar or bitcoin that might subsequently be subject to a legal or enforcement claim due to its involvement in a previous transaction, the uncertainty attached to it will, by definition, reduce its utility. This leads to a depletion of monetary fungibility. As to why that’s a problem, just ask anyone with an account at a brokerage or other entity whose assets have been frozen for some criminal or civil action over which they themselves had no involvement.

So, privacy matters. If we are to bring digital, borderless commerce to the widest possible user base and expand the global economy, we must strive for privacy.

Privacy Tech Meets Increased Surveillance

Sadly, bitcoin failed to achieve sufficient privacy, at least in its initial form. Why? Because its public ledger is, well, public.

When combined with the “know your customer” procedures of legally compliant crypto exchanges, its traceability means a user can relatively easily be connected to past transactions once they have been identified at any one of those on- and off-ramps.

This is the problem that led to the creation of cryptocurrencies with more robust privacy protections such as Zcash and Monero, along with the invention of bitcoin mixers and potential sidechain solutions for obscuring transaction trails such as Mimblewimble.

Indeed, it’s quite noteworthy that at the same time that regulators are expanding their purview over cryptocurrencies – see the Financial Action Task Force’s new disclosure rules – and demanding increasingly more user-identifying information, cryptocurrency developers are driving in the opposite direction: toward more privacy, more self-custody, more trustless exchange solutions, more user autonomy. They’re striving for the goal of electronic cash.

The Centralization- Decentralization Contradiction

Here’s the catch: if you’re not building on top of a fully decentralized, permissionless system though, it’s impossible to assure users of privacy. If the nodes maintaining the ledger are identified as belonging to a particular list of authorized validators – e.g. the Libra Association’s 28 members – authorities can, and will, demand the identity of users when they so desire or they’ll have transactions censored or reversed. They’ll do so to meet anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism objectives, or, more cynically, they’ll make such demands to simply assert control over the population (e.g. digital surveillance in China.)

Facebook’s David Marcus, as the identifiable representative of a U.S. incorporated company, had no option, of course, but to swear that Facebook’s Libra application, Calibra, would comply with KYC requirements and cooperate with anti-money laundering initiatives. It was a legal no-brainer. It didn’t matter much, though, because law enforcement agencies – with just a little bit of cross-border cooperation – will be able to hold him to his word by way of the Libra Association members themselves.

Therein lies the “don’t worry, we’re centralized” side of the bifurcated argument Santori alluded to. It’s the assurance that says “you know where to find me.”

The problem is that the American people – and, by extension, their lawmakers – are kind of schizophrenic on these matters. That’s because, quite rightly, privacy is also becoming an increasing concern with regards to tech companies’ data collection, and especially with Facebook. It was quite striking – satisfying, in fact – to see how many questions from lawmakers addressed these concerns, where they sought assurances that Calibra would not exploit people’s personal data.

In essence, Marcus’s response was: “don’t worry, we’re decentralized.” The idea was that the structure simply won’t permit any member to invade a user’s privacy.

So, it’s a contradiction, but one that, by definition, doesn’t arise within bitcoin or other decentralized cryptocurrencies, which can much more accurately say, “you don’t know where to find me.” (In fact, there is no “me” in such cases.)

What Do We Want?

In many respects, this contradiction is not a function of Facebook’s involvement in this project or Libra’s structure per se but of competing public interests. We can’t have our cake and eat it too. We can’t simultaneously insist on absolute privacy and the power to intervene in transactions to catch bad guys laundering money.

I believe the answer lies in a combination of technologies, system designs and a more creative approach to regulation that, unfortunately, doesn’t exist yet.

Hope lies in tools such as zero-knowledge proofs and in emerging “self-sovereign” identity concepts, as well as in a more open-minded regulatory model for curtailing crime – one that doesn’t depend on revealing people’s personal identifying information.

But these are a ways off; they will require user adoption and; to a still large extent, belief in them by policymakers.

For now, then, David Marcus and his cohorts have no choice but to keep speaking out of both sides of their mouths.

While Libra is expected to draw retail customers to cryptocurrencies, Bakkt is likely to attract institutional investors. Following the Bakkt Digital Asset Summit held on July 18, Managing director and quant strategist at Fundstrat Global Advisors Sam Doctor anticipates that Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures contracts might launch in the current quarter.

Fidelity’s crypto arm Fidelity Digital Assets Services has applied for a license with the New York Department of Financial Services. If approved, the firm can start its custodial services in the state of New York. Both these services will address concerns of the institutional players and might hasten their arrival.

The cryptocurrencies have bottomed out and have started a new bull market that has legs to run. In an uptrend, the dips are a buying opportunity. Let’s see if we spot any buy setups in the top five market performers of the past seven days.

BSV/USD

The Bitcoin SV (BSV) network will complete the Quasar upgrade on July 24, which will increase the default block size hard cap from 128MB to 2GB. After a few months of the upgrade, the cryptocurrency will be able to handle thousands of transactions every second. DRIVE Markets has launched trading in Bitcoin SV. Backed by these positive news, the digital currency has turned out as the top performer among major cryptocurrencies. It has rallied close to 25% in the past seven days. Can it continue its up move or will it witness profit booking at higher levels? Let’s analyze the chart.

The BSV/USD pair broke below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally this week, but lower levels saw sharp buying that has propelled the price right back up. This is a positive sign as it confirms demand at lower levels. The price can now reach $214.210 and above it $255.620. If the bulls propel the price to a new high, the uptrend will continue.

However, after forming large ranges in the past two weeks, we expect the volatility to cool down and the pair to enter a consolidation for a few weeks. The pair will turn negative if the price turns around from one of the overhead resistances and plummets below $107. Nonetheless, we give it a low probability of occurring.

XTZ/USD

Tezos (XTZ) is the second-best performer of the past seven days, rising close to 20%. Can it build on its momentum and start a new uptrend? Let’s see the chart.

The XTZ/USD pair is largely range-bound between $0.33 and $1.85. For the past three weeks, the bulls have managed to defend $0.902128, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. The bulls have not been able to push the price above $1.295480, which shows profit-booking at higher levels. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to 50, which suggests that the digital currency might consolidate for a few more weeks.

If the pair breaks out of $1.295480, it can rally to $1.85. A breakout of $1.85 will start a new uptrend that has a long-term target objective of $3.37. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $1.295480 and keep a stop loss of $0.80.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from $1.295480 and plummets below $0.829651. If that happens, a drop to $0.33 is probable.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) CEO Justin Sun tweeted that something big will happen next week along with the Warren Buffet lunch. Sun has invited influential people in the crypto universe to join him for the power lunch with the legendary investor. The crypto community has kept its fingers crossed on the outcome of the meeting.

The TRX/USD pair had broken down of the channel last week. Though bears broke below the critical support of $0.022 during the week, they could not sustain the price at lower levels. Aggressive buying has propelled the price back into the channel. This is a positive sign.

There is a minor resistance at the downtrend line above which the pair can move up to $0.040. A breakout of this resistance can push the price to $0.050. The traders can wait for the price to scale above the downtrend line before buying. The stop loss can be kept at $0.020 because if this support gives way, a drop to $0.017740 and below it a retest of the yearly low is probable.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) was recently named as the official cryptocurrency of the Miami Dolphins. This will increase the visibility of the cryptocurrency among NFL fans. With halving just a few days away, can the price resume its uptrend or will it remain range-bound? Let’s find out.

After failing to break out of the ascending channel a few weeks ago, the LTC/USD pair plummeted below the channel last week. The bears followed it up with a breakdown of the support at $83.65. However, they could not sustain the lower levels and the price has quickly bounced back. This shows strong demand at lower levels.

Currently, the bulls are facing resistance at the channel line. This line, which had previously acted as a support is likely to act as a resistance. Nevertheless, if the price climbs back into the channel, it will be a positive sign. The next level to watch on the upside is $140.3450. Therefore, traders can wait for the price to re-enter the channel and sustain it before buying. The stop loss can be kept at the recent lows of $76.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the channel and plunges below $76. In such a case, a drop to $58 is probable.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) rallied close to 5% in the past seven days. Is this the start of a new uptrend or is this only a pullback in a downtrend. Let’s study the chart.

Due to a short trading history, we are analyzing the daily charts for the ATOM/USD pair. The pair has given up a lot of ground in the recent correction. It is currently attempting to bounce off the $3.6043–$3.4101 support zone.

The pullback is likely to face resistance at the 20-day EMA. The next fall towards the support zone will give us a better idea whether the bottom is in place. If the price breaks below $3.4101 during the next fall, it can retest the lows at $2.9277.

Conversely, if the pair rebounds off the support zone and breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it is likely to reach the 50-day SMA and above it $6.15. Therefore, traders can watch the price action during the next fall and buy on a breakout above 20-day EMA. The stops can be placed below $3.40.

OKB/USD*

OKB is the native token of OKEx, a world-leading cryptocurrency exchange. It is trading well above its listing price. The token offers its users opportunities to set up OKEx partner exchanges, settle trading fees and subscribe to new tokens sale on the OK jumpstart platform.

The total supply of OKB is 1 billion, out of which only 300 million is in circulation and the rest has been locked up until 2022. The long-term hodlers of the token will benefit from the OKB Buy-Back & Burn Program, which will be run every 3 months. Currently, the token is operating on the ERC-20 protocol but will soon migrate to the OKChain mainnet – being developed by OKEx — which is in its final stages of testing.

In its evaluation report, Shinobi Capital, an established blockchain and cryptocurrency advisory firm, expects OKB to benefit from the development of OKChain mainnet and better market conditions for cryptocurrencies. They expect OKB to hit a market capitalization of about $7.068 billion by 2020.

OKB has been listed on Bitfinex and is attempting to partner with other exchanges to further expand the ecosystem. At press time, the token is ranked 1,878 on CoinMarketCap with a 24-hour volume of $142,547,972. So, is this a good opportunity to scoop OKB before prices shoot up? Let’s look at the technical picture.

The OKB/USD pair hit a high of $6.68 on May 18, 2018, and from there, it lost a lot of ground during the crushing bear market and fell to a low of $0.5718 on January 13, 2019. However, it participated in the recovery and rose to a high of $2.5566 on April 3. That is a 347% gain within three months.

Thereafter, the pullback found support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the up-move. It consolidated between $1.30 and $1.829 for a few days before breaking out. It again got stuck in the $1.55–$2.09 range for a few days.

Currently, the price has broken out of the range and is likely to move up to $2.5566, which will act as a stiff resistance. If this level is scaled, the price can move up to $4 and above it to $5.40. Both moving averages are gradually sloping up, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.

However, if bears defend $2.5566, the digital currency might remain range-bound between $2.09 and $2.5566 for a few days. It will lose momentum on a break below the 50-day SMA and will turn negative on a breakdown of $1.2616.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://www.coindesk.com/a-scam-crypto-site-stole-my-identity-to-rip-off-veterans-and-im-furious,"This week, I was hurled into the ranks of the unfortunate people who have had their identities stolen by a dodgy crypto enterprise – and, as the above headline indicates, I’m pissed.

As I was informed by a well-wisher via an email this week, I am being advertised as an “advisor” to a supposed cryptocurrency project called “US Veteran Token” (USVT) that insinuates that it in some way supports the men and women that have admirably served their country in the military.

But it appears to all be a ruse. A big fat fake.

The sender of the email informed me that, not only had I been linked to the website, but members of his team had also had their bios stolen and posted on the site.

My own bio was lifted, along with an older image, verbatim, from the CoinDesk website. That is, apart from my cryptocurrency disclosure, which had been hiked significantly in value and altered to include USVT.

For the record, if it isn’t already clear, I do not own any USVT, and I do not have any association with the project. My emailer said that, in fact, the site was a rip-off of a genuine military-focused service he had been developing, but is currently on hold.

Still, I suppose I should take some small satisfaction in being in good company. Also included in “testimonials” is chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Jay Clayton.

When CoinDesk reached out to Clayton’s office, we got the reply from an SEC spokesperson:

“Neither the SEC nor the Chairman endorse or approve securities offerings, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) or cryptocurrency offerings. While SEC staff reviews filings for compliance with disclosure obligations, the SEC does not evaluate the merits of any offering nor does it determine if securities offered are good investments.”

Others who are listed as being connected with the site have also taken to social media to make it clear they have no involvement with the suspect project.

Sorry to interrupt all the fun Libra tweets, but I just want to say I am not affiliated with this project: https://t.co/EGFWLUB1E5 This must be a scam if it is listing people like me who have never even heard of it as part of the team. It seems some people have already lost money — Laura Shin (@laurashin) July 17, 2019

At press time, the site is showing 404 status and most content is not showing. Whether someone has taken action or the project thought better of its actions, I’m not sure.

But with it showing many hallmarks of a scam, my opinion is crypto investors out there would do well to avoid US Veteran Token (usveterantoken[dot]net) and its touted “ICO,” if it should get back online

Bitcoin has been on a tear since the start of the year and “crypto winter” has officially been declared over by many analysts. While a lot is pointing towards a continuance of the current “crypto spring” rally, some investors (and notorious bitcoin bears) believe that we could see a correction in the coming months.

In this guide, you will discover seven ways that you can short cryptoassets if you have a bearish outlook for 2019.

Shorting on digital asset exchanges

Perhaps the simplest way to short cryptoassets is on digital asset exchanges that enable margin trading. Exchanges such as BitMEX, Bitfinex, and Poloniex allow traders to short cryptocurrencies on margin.

To short sell on a digital asset exchange, you need to borrow a cryptoasset from margin lenders to sell the asset that you do not own and then, buy the asset back once your target price has been met so that you can sell it back to the lender. The exchange handles the backend of this process and you will be charged a borrowing fee for each day that you are shorting the asset.

Your profit (or loss) will be the difference between the price you short sold at and the price at which you have bought the asset back at minus the margin lending fee, which differs from platform to platform.

If you are using leverage, this profit or loss can be amplified by the leverage ratio you choose.

Shorting crypto CFDs

Alternatively, you can also short cryptocurrency CFD (contract for difference) on online brokerages, such as CMC Markets or FXCM. For investors who are more comfortable with trading on traditional online brokerages as opposed to digital asset exchanges, this may be the most suitable options for going short crypto.

The process of short selling a cryptocurrency CFD is the same as on a digital asset exchange with the key difference being that the profits are paid out in fiat currency as opposed to digital currency.

From a user point of view, all you need to do is ensure you have enough funds on your account to cover margin requirements and to hit the sell button on the cryptocurrency CFD of your choice at the price level you want to short it at.

Daily borrowing fees also apply to CFDs. These need to be taken into consideration when short selling an asset. The longer you hold onto your short position, the more the borrowing fees will add up.

Selling crypto futures

If you want to short cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH), you could also sell futures on cryptoasset derivatives trading platforms, such as Deribit and Quedex.

Futures are financial derivatives that enable traders to buy or sell an asset at a predefined price at a predetermined date in the future. Futures, therefore, allow you to bet on the price development of an asset without having to own it.

The process of selling futures is effectively the same as shorting cryptocurrencies on digital asset exchanges or CFD brokerages but requires a bit more understanding of derivatives. Hence, it would be an option for more experienced traders.

Buying crypto put options

As an alternative to selling futures, you could also use financial options to generate a potential profit in a falling market. Options are financial derivatives that provide the holder with the right but not the obligation to buy (or sell) an asset at a specific price on a predetermined future date.

If you believe that the price of bitcoin will lose over 50% of its value and drop below the USD 5,000 mark within the next three months, you could buy a bitcoin put option with a strike price of USD 5,000 that expires in September.

You will have to pay the premium (also known as the price) of the put option and if the price of bitcoin drops below the USD 5,000 mark, your profit will be the difference between the price at which you execute your option and the market price of bitcoin minus the amount you paid for the premium.

Options are, therefore, a reasonably inexpensive way to short cryptoassets as you only lose the premium if the option expires and the strike price has not been met. However, due to the technical aspects of options, they are better suited for more experienced traders than beginners.

Going short in prediction markets

If you are comfortable interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and dealing with smart contracts, you could also express your short view on a specific cryptoasset on prediction platforms.

Decentralized, peer-to-peer prediction markets, such as Ethereum-based Augur, enable individuals to bet on the outcome of certain events, such as asset prices, elections, the weather or anything else that users can come up with, using cryptocurrency as a stake.

If your prediction turns out to be correct, you win and are rewarded in cryptocurrency.

Prediction markets offer a wide range of possibilities to bet on the price of different cryptoassets, so they can also be used to express short views.

Short Selling Crypto ETNs

If you prefer to trade regulated financial products and want to short cryptocurrencies, you could short sell cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (ETN), such as the Bitcoin Tracker One, Litecoin Tracker One or the Ether Tracker One by XBT Provider, on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

To put on such a trade, you will require a brokerage account that supports crypto exchange-traded notes as well as short selling.

Selling binary options

Finally, you could also use so-called “binary options” to express your short view on a specific cryptoasset.

Binary options are financial derivatives where the payoff is either a fixed monetary amount or zero. Most binary options markets have maturities of ten minutes, thirty minutes or one hour, which means you are betting on whether the price of the underlying asset goes up or down within a very short time period. As a result, these are highly risky financial products that should only be utilized by experienced traders who fully understand the product.

However, if you believe that, for example, the price of bitcoin will end the day in the red because of an expected regulatory announcement or because an exchange hack occurred, you could sell an end-of-day binary option on bitcoin that pays out once the trading day (as determined by the brokerage) has come to a close.

That was a key takeaway from last week’s contentious hearings in on Facebook’s Libra project in Washington, D.C.. While giving Facebook executive David Marcus the third degree, lawmakers took pains to distinguish between the social network’s project and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

For example, Sen. Brian Schatz (D.-HI) asked Marcus to explain why Facebook specifically had to build a cryptocurrency, and not just argue what the benefits of a cryptocurrency network could be in general. Rep. Denver Riggleman (R.-VA) hammered Marcus on the security implications of using the RUST programming to implement Libra. And Rep. Warren Davidson (R.-OH) famously asked CoinShares chief strategy officer Meltem Demirors to explain the difference between bitcoin and “shitcoins.”

“Whatever their thoughts on Facebook and Libra, they didn’t paint their thoughts of bitcoin and crypto with the same brush,” said Omer Ozden, CEO of Rocktree Capital, a blockchain-focused merchant bank.

And while some elected officials – cough, Brad Sherman (D.-CA) – may have trotted out reliably anti-crypto tropes such as that Libra would be worse than 9/11, for the most part last week’s hearings indicated a sort of maturity about how lawmakers are approaching the space now.

Even among the members of Congress who were “less knowledgeable” about the space, “I was really impressed to see they knew enough to say ‘we know the hearings are separate from crypto,'” Ozden said. “They at least knew enough to separate that.”

It was a far cry from last year, when lawmakers called for strict regulatory protections in the crypto space, even if those calls ultimately did not result in action.

“We’ve come a long way in terms of the understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in Congress,” said Perianne Boring, founder of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which held a blockchain education event with lawmakers the day after the second hearing.

“It was encouraging to see that there are more members of Congress … that are able to make that distinction between different types of products and services and applications that are available and also being able to understand they’re different,” she said.

Taking action

The Digital Chamber’s Blockchain Education Day saw representatives from just under 120 companies in the crypto space meet with staffers or elected officials from 70 different offices in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

“It is clear that lawmakers are aware of the great potential of this new industry,” said Matthew Trudeau, chief strategy officer at crypto derivatives exchange ErisX. “We were pleased with the depth of discussion and quality of questions we received during the meetings ErisX participated in.”

Likewise, Anthony Tu-Sekine, partner at the law firm of Seward & Kissel LLP, told CoinDesk that the staffers he met with had a “genuine interest” in blockchain, as well as some level of understanding.

“I think it is fair to say that most of their perceptions are formed based on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” he added. “I think it is important that the community take every opportunity to educate the staff about other blockchain applications, to avoid a situation where all of the discourse (and potential legislation) is driven by concerns associated with cryptocurrencies or their issuers.”

In the days before Congress held its hearings, a draft bill began circulating which would prevent companies with more than $25 billion in assets from providing financial services, written by members of the House Financial Services Committee. Rep. Ted Budd (R.-NC) told CoinDesk that in his view, the bill seemed overly broad.

While the bill appeared targeted at Facebook in particular, it could possibly also impact Apple and Google, both of which offer payment services, he said.

Despite Rep. Maxine Waters (D.-CA), chair of the House Financial Services Committee, saying the bill would be discussed during Wednesday’s hearing, the matter did not actually come up for any substantive discussion.

Chen Arad, chief marketing officer of compliance Solidus Labs, said the way the committee appears to be handling the potential legislation was a positive sign.

“I particularly appreciated Chairman Waters repeatedly admitting the committee doesn’t understand the issue well enough, and that they’re looking to learn before they can take legislative action effectively,” he said.

Congress seems interested in taking some action, Boring said. Her hope is that any legislation or other action is informed, with industry stakeholders taking part in the conversation. She concluded:

“We want to make sure whatever that is is not just a knee-jerk reaction to one company.”

Iran’s Economic Commission approves crypto mining ‘mechanism’

Governor of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), Abdolnaser Hemmati said that “a mechanism to mine digital coins was approved by the government’s economic commission and will later be put to discussion at a Cabinet meeting.”

Initially, Iranian authorities announced that they are planning to authorize Bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining earlier in July, when the CBI governor Abdol Hemmati reportedly claimed that the Iranian government had approved some parts of an executive law that would authorize mining of cryptocurrencies in Iran.

At the time, Hemmati argued that digital currency miners in Iran should contribute to the country’s economy, rather than letting mined Bitcoin (BTC) escape abroad.

Also, at the Commission’s latest meeting, its head Elyas Hazrati said that cryptocurrency is now recognized as official by the government, adding:

“We do believe that cryptocurrency industry should be recognized as an official industry in Iran to let the country take advantage of its tax and customs revenues.”

Crypto mining industry taking shape in Iran

Today’s news also follows the finalizing of a tariff scheme for cryptocurrency miners by the Commission on July 21. Energy Minister Homayoon Ha’eri did not specify the exact price scheme, but stated that the price is dependent on market factors such as fuel prices in the Persian Gulf.

Also yesterday, Deputy President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA) Jamal Arounaghi announced that the agency has not yet issued licenses for the import of cryptocurrency mining equipment. The minister said that if the government authorizes import of crypto miners, IRICA will develop related directives.

As we recently wrote, cryptocurrencies like the popular bitcoin have enjoyed a return-to-form in recent weeks. The prices of bitcoin and other well-known blockchain-based assets have risen this summer, leading to a seeming rise in media attention and growth in trading volume.

Subscribe to the Crunchbase Dailye

Both are bullish for companies operating in the cryptocurrency space. There’s historical precedent for cryptocurrency companies in the trading game performing well when crypto prices appreciate. As there’s a pretty direct correlation between the price of bitcoin et al and trading appetite; when the price of cryptocurrencies rise, trading revenues presumably grow as well.

In the late-2017 crypto bull run Coinbase stacked huge revenues and profits, for example. Later, the company would raise off those results, adding to both its bank balance and valuation. Other firms rode the same wave, including Bitmain, which later had to pull its public offering after swinging from profits to losses.

So, when the price of bitcoin recently appreciated from the $3,000s in January to the $5,000s by April to $13,000 in July to a more modest $10,560 today, I was waiting for the impact of the price run to show up elsewhere.

This morning we got a little taste. Recall that we noted above that a rising price of cryptocurrency and related assets leads to a rise in trading volume of the same entities. Here’s a chart from The Block’s Frank Chaparro citing his colleague Larry Cermak who used data from their own publication, along with information from CoinGecko:

There are two things that we care about in the chart this morning. First, as expected trading volume has risen as the price of bitcoin and its subordinate crypto co-constituents have appreciated. And, second, that Coinbase has seen (according to this dataset) its trading volume rise sharply in recent months.

As Coinbase has a sliding fee structure for what it calls “Buy/Sell Transactions” we can presume that the higher trading volume is leading to revenue growth for the American crypto-focused unicorn. The last price that we have for Coinbase is an $8.0 billion post-money valuation, meaning that the seven-year-old company has lots to live up to in revenue and profit terms.

Given the above chart, it seems like Coinbase, along with a host of smaller crypto-focused companies, is likely enjoying a welcome business boost after a turn in the wilderness after the most recent crypto bust.

Is India finally about to ban cryptocurrencies?

The panel recommended to the government today to ban cryptocurrencies and impose sanctions for any dealings involving crypto assets. Reuters adds that, according to a government statement, the report and draft legislation released by the panel behind the recommendation will be examined by regulators and the government before taking a final decision.

A local ban is not surprising

Earlier this month, India’s Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur has pointed out that there is no law in India expressly prohibiting the use of cryptocurrencies. Still, draft legislation that would allegedly impose a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in India has been published by local blockchain legal experts on social media over a week ago.

The given 18-page draft proposes a definition of cryptocurrencies as “any information or code or number or token not being part of any Official Digital Currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value.”

While all assets fitting this definition would be prohibited, the regulation also suggests that a digital rupee, issued by India’s central bank, would be recognized as legal tender.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, Bitcoin (BTC) proponent and Tezos investor Tim Draper hit out at the Indian government on July 16 calling the government “pathetic and corrupt” for the proposed ban on cryptocurrency.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-ends-longest-losing-streak-since-december,"View

Bitcoin logged gains in the three days to July 20, snapping the longest losing streak on the three-day chart since December.

The bias, however, is still bearish with prices holding below $11,080 (as per Bitstamp).

Key indicators on short-duration charts are biased for a fall back below $10,000.

A 4-hour close above $11,080 would activate twin bullish cues and could yield a rally to $12,000.

A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) or consecutive daily close above $12,000 is needed to confirm a continuation of the bull market.

Bitcoin (BTC) ended its longest losing streak in seven months over the weekend, but the outlook still remains bearish.

The top cryptocurrency by market capitalization eked out 10.83 percent gains in the three days to July 20, confirming a green candle on the three-day chart.

The green candle notably formed following three consecutive red candles, representing bitcoin’s longest losing streak since the end of December, according to Bitstamp data.

Back then, BTC had created four straight read candles, as seen in the chart below.

Losing streak snapped

As seen above, bitcoin’s recovery rally from the bear market low of $3,122 on Dec. 15 ended with a four-candle losing streak, which saw prices create a bearish lower high at $4,236 and drop by 15 percent to $3,560.

The resistance created at $4,236 remained intact for more than three months before bitcoin breached that on the back of higher volumes on April 2, confirming a long term bearish-to-bullish trend change.

What followed was a solid rise to $13,880 by June 24. Essentially, BTC more than tripled in value in six months to June 24 and was looking overbought at the start of the current month.

Therefore, the latest three-candle losing streak likely marked a healthy correction of the bull market, as noted by popular technical and fundamental analyst Alex Kruger.

While the losing trend has ended, the correction phase may not be over yet, as the cryptocurrency is yet to violate the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $11,080, as noted on Friday.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,460 on Bitstamp – down 1.47 percent on a 24-hour basis.

4-hour chart

Bitcoin clocked a high of $11,120 on Saturday, but failed to close above $11,080 and fell back to $10,300, leaving intact the bearish lower highs pattern created during the sell-off from $13,200 to $9,049.

The moving average convergence divergence histogram has crossed below zero, signaling a bullish-to-bearish trend change, meaning the bounce from the July 17 low of $9,049 has ended and prices may fall back below $10,000 over the next 24 hours.

Supporting the bearish case is the below 50-print on the relative strength index.

Bitcoin, however, may rise to $12,000 this week if prices break above $11,080, activating twin bullish cues: invalidation of lower highs and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout (above right).

The neckline resistance of a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is currently located at $11,130.

Weekly chart

On the weekly chart, $12,000 is the level to beat for the bulls.

A convincing weekly close on Sunday (UTC), or a back-to-back daily close above $12,000 would invalidate the buyer exhaustion signaled by bitcoin’s repeated failure to hold onto gains above that level, as shown by candles with long upper wicks (see arrows).

That, however, looks unlikely, with the 14-week RSI rolling over from the overbought territory (above 70) and the MACD histogram losing altitude, a sign of weakening bullish momentum.

Also, on the three-day chart, the MACD has turned bearish for the first time since December.

All-in-all, the odds of BTC falling below $10,000 in the next day or two are high. On the downside, key support is located at $9,097 (May 30 high).

Figures provided by the country’s justice ministry on Sunday indicate that losses from crypto scams, Ponzi schemes, embezzlement and illegal exchange transactions came to 2.69 trillion won from July 2017 to June 2019.

The ministry further said that 420 individuals have been charged over cryptocurrency crimes in that period, with 132 having been arrested.

In June, Justice Minister Park Sang-ki ordered prosecutors to claw back the profits of crypto crimes in tough new measures, according to Yonhap.

Notably, the crime figures don’t include losses from exchange hacks.

The South Korean Bithumb exchange has been hacked twice over the period, first for around $30 million in 2018, then for $13 million in 2019. The Coinrail exchange also lost possibly $40 million in 2018.

The number of crypto exchanges operating in the country has grown in the last year, Yonhap says, with 205 now offering services in the country as of May.

Democratic Party member Je Youn-kyung has proposed legislation to bring in stricter cybersecurity rules for crypto platforms, which is currently pending passage in Korea’s National Assembly.

We are often told that the verification of bitcoin transactions eats a lot of energy. The largely inaccurate comparison to a small country, the size of Ireland or Denmark, is evoked thanks to numerous clickbait headlines. What mainstream media fails to explain, however, is that bitcoin mining is actually helping electricity producers prevent energy waste. Hydropower plants, for example, can generate and sell much more electricity during rainy seasons in some regions or when snow melts in others. Wastage can be mitigated through a symbiosis with bitcoin farms, at no additional cost for the environment.

Plum Rain Brings Life to China’s Mining Industry

During the prolonged winter the crypto industry had to endure, the mining sector saw its profits diminish almost to the point of no return. After another of Bitcoin’s prematurely pronounced deaths turned out to be a false alarm, miners are back exploring business opportunities. The days when mining companies were turning their ASIC rigs into scrap metal are gone.

With spring, prices unseen since last year returned to the crypto markets. In China, which controls a large portion of the global hashrate, the wet season, known in Eastern Asia as the ‘plum rain,’ brought lower electricity rates in provinces with developed hydroelectric infrastructure. The main ingredients in the recipe of profitable mining are back on the table. It’s been reported that miners are once again buying ASICs.

When rain starts pouring in May, rivers and dams in China fill up pretty quickly. Hydroelectric stations reach their peak capacity producing more than local industry and households need. That prompts authorities and utilities in provinces such as the southwestern Sichuan to bring down electricity rates to as low as 0.2 yuan (around $0.03) per kilowatt-hour (kWh), stimulating the consumption of cheap and green energy produced by hydroelectric plants.

Beijing-based Bitmain is among the companies taking advantage of lower electricity prices by utilizing surplus hydro power generated in Sichuan during the spring and summer months. Back in March, Chinese media reported that the mining giant had deployed around 100,000 mining rigs in the region before the start of the rainy season, with plans to install another 200,000 devices within the next few months.

Using hydro power for coin minting, when water levels are at their highest, is a win-win situation for both crypto miners and electricity producers. The cooperation can be highly profitable not only for the bitcoin mining facilities but also for energy companies as it allows them to raise the efficiency of their power generating capacities and ultimately increase their revenue.

Hydropower Plants and Cryptocurrency Miners Mint Coins for Mutual Benefit

Hydroelectric generation provides a great way to use excess power for cryptocurrency mining and also fund renewable energy, commented Shaun Chong, mining product manager at Bitcoin.com. He also acknowledged that mining profitability has improved significantly with rising crypto prices. “Cloud mining sales do a lot better during bull markets,” he said. The Bitcoin.com Pool is in partnership with mining datacenters in the U.S., Sweden and China. Chong noted:

All of them are using hydro power. All our cloud mining is powered by hydroelectricity.

Most mining companies working in Sichuan have direct contractual relations with the hydropower plants they build their farms at, Kirk Su, business development manager responsible for Bitcoin.com’s operations in China, told news.Bitcoin.com. The contracts do provide lower electricity prices for crypto miners. “Everyone gets different rates but they are typically around 0.2 RMB,” Su added. That’s around $0.03 per kWh.

Kirk Su himself runs a mining farm operating in Aba, Sichuan using electrical energy from a 150MW state-owned hydropower plant. His 10MW facility is considered a midsized farm in the province, which is home to 50MW and even bigger farms. “During the wet season, typically from April through November, these power plants will generate much more electricity than the grid needs. Hence, the excess power eventually goes to waste,” the miner explained.

Su noted that most companies in Sichuan work with private power plants as crypto mining in the People’s Republic is still somewhat a grey area. Some mining businesses, however, have managed to establish relations with state-owned enterprises. That actually provides them some protection against potential government crackdowns. On the flip side, these farms are more expensive to build as state enterprises are obliged to meet strict official standards.

Nevertheless, the cooperation is beneficial for both sides. “For the hydropower plant, they get to sell excess energy they wouldn’t be able to transfer to the grid during the wet season. For cryptocurrency miners, it’s obvious – we get cheap power,” Kirk Su pointed out. He further added that Chinese miners prefer to attract power plants as investors in their projects. The participation incentivizes energy producers to protect the mining farms from authorities when needed.

Lack of Predictability Hampers Mining Growth in the East

China, while very important for bitcoin minting at this stage, with its low electricity rates and authorities mostly turning a blind eye to mining, has one serious disadvantage – the lack of long-term predictability. The rainy season comes and goes year after year, but no one really knows when the regulatory storm will begin. The People’s Republic, just like many other countries in the Eastern hemisphere, including the former Soviet republics, offers miners a lot in terms of potential profits. But for many companies with insufficient local connections, the inability to ensure uninterrupted operations for years ahead is a major concern.

Russia, another country with a huge surplus of cheap energy, is also a good example in that respect. The collapse of many heavy industries following the dissolution of the Soviet Union left a third of its power generating capacities idling. Electricity rates in some energy-rich regions like Irkutsk can drop below $0.02 per kWh. The Siberian oblast, where the Angara River flows, is home to a large number of hydropower stations.

The local power company Irkutskenergo, which belongs to the large Russian En+ Group, announced last year a tender to lease five land plots to cryptocurrency mining farms and supply them with cheap electricity. The sites are located at its hydroelectric stations in Ust Ilimsk, Bratsk and Irkutsk, the largest of which has a generating capacity of almost 4,000 MW. En+ held talks with several mining investors in an effort to diversify its customer base. Another major operator, Eurosibenergo, also tried to attract mining businesses to some of its 20 power plants.

The realization of such partnerships, however, is hampered by the lack of a comprehensive legal framework for the growing Russian crypto industry. The adoption of a package of laws designed to regulate the sector has been postponed multiple times. For now, the future of cryptocurrencies in Russia remains uncertain and that applies to the mining sector as well, despite the more positive attitude of authorities in Moscow towards data processing in general.

Not as Simple as Parking a Farm Next to a Dam

This is precisely why Race-Cap, a company with interests in various blockchain-related fields and a partner of Bitcoin.com, has chosen Sweden for its high-performance datacenter and maintains offices in crypto-friendly Zurich as well as the global financial capitals London and New York. News.Bitcoin.com spoke with Race-Cap CEO Arthur Davis about the reasoning behind their preferences for mining destinations.

Davis believes Sweden and the United States are the two most important Western regions where a stable mining operation can be established. In his view, very important considerations when choosing a location suitable to crypto mining are regulations permitting this activity in the first place, favorable public opinion, and a stable tax environment. Next on the checklist are low energy prices and the presence of renewable sources ensuring “the best long-term natural value for all participants.”

Sweden, where Race-Cap has deployed its “Sky Computing” facility, as the entrepreneur calls it, meets these preconditions in one degree or another. Like any other mining hotspot, the Nordic country has its distinctions and they provide bitcoin miners with a different set of challenges in comparison with China. As Arthur Davis puts it:

One cannot simply look at parking an operation next to a hydro dam and thinking all will work well.

Unlike the People’s Republic, the energy system in Sweden is integrated with all power sources – hydro, wind, nuclear – feeding into the common grid. Energy is purchased from the market based on plugging into this grid at three levels of downstream availability, Davis explained. Only a power company may plug into the fourth, national level.

The price of electricity for end users has two components, as is the case in many other European countries. “Transmission” refers to the cost of consumed energy and the cost of “distribution” varies depending on where a consumer plugs into the grid. The higher into the grid the electricity is purchased from a distributor, or the closer to a primary source, the cheaper it is. There are certain advantages to being close to an energy producer. In terms of transmission, electricity is purchased from the open market at floating tariffs and any surplus from hydro sources is reflected in the spot price.

“There are pockets where one could build facilities near primary sources of power. But they are on a case by case basis. Even if power is available near a hydro station, it may be that the grid requires upgrading to take off the power, and this may be a 5 year process to actually be able to draw it down,” Race-Cap’s chief executive noted. “We have looked at a number of sites where the timeframe is 3-5 years to actually obtain the power near a primary power generation and transmission facility.”

The company’s mining facility is situated in Norrsundet, on the coast and in the middle of the country, which is the termination point for a planned enormous offshore wind energy development, which should be constructed in the next few years. Arthur Davis pointed out that Microsoft has recently purchased a big parcel of land to deploy datacenter infrastructure in the region, and Google has also reserved large-scale power in the area.

However, the crypto entrepreneur remarked that the proximity to efficient power generating facilities is not necessarily the only consideration. A decision to build and operate a datacenter should depend on the balance between all factors: “In the far north, where hydro power is plentiful, it may be too cold to properly operate the servers. We have seen other datacenters have significant issue with it being too cold, and therefore capital is required to invest to warm them up, somewhat counterproductive.”

A Government That Realizes Surplus Energy Needs More Consumers

Cold is not an issue in certain parts of South America that are also very rich in water resources and hydropower capacities. While many countries experience energy shortages, Paraguay is one of those producing more than they need. It is home to the world’s most powerful hydroelectric plant, built at the Itaipú dam on the Paraná River, which generates over 100 terawatt-hours of electricity annually. Another large hydroelectric power station is operating at the Yacyretá dam built over the waterfalls of Jasyreta-Apipé. The country currently uses only about half of the electricity the two power plants can produce.

Unlike other nations, the Paraguayan government has realized the benefit of having bitcoin farms next to its hydroelectric stations. A deal with two crypto companies aims to prevent energy waste. Bitfury Group, and the Korea-based Commons Foundation, announced earlier this year their new partnerships to create and operate mining facilities powered by the hydroelectric energy from the plants at the two dams. Authorities in Asunción have promised to provide five sites for the project.

In the announcement, QuickBit revealed that personal data such as names, addresses, email addresses and card information of 2% of its customers was exposed. QuickBit said that no passwords or social security numbers, complete account or credit card information, cryptocurrency or private keys, or financial transactions were exposed or affected.

QuickBit initially published its suspicions about the data incident on July 19, stating that their internal investigation indicated that neither QuickBit nor the company's customers had been affected. Later that day, the exchange’s managing director Jörgen Eriksson wrote that external security experts warned the company that some data had been poorly protected.

In today’s announcement, the exchange explained how the database was exposed:

“QuickBit has recently adopted a third-party system for supplementary security screening of customers. In connection with the delivery of this system, it has been on a server that has been visible outside QuickBits firewall for a few days, and thus accessible to the person who has the right tools.”

QuickBit further claims that its technicians have taken steps to ensure that all servers are protected and prevent the possibility of similar incidents, adding that it will publish a public version of the incident report on its website.

In late June, South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb was prosecuted for its alleged failure to take adequate measures to protect personal information, which was later presumably exploited by hackers to steal funds from the platform.

On June 12, the Honestnode team announced the release of a new stablecoin project built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network called Honestcoin (USDH). The new token was made using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) and recently launched on the cryptocurrency trading platform Coinex. This week news.Bitcoin.com spoke with the founder of Honestnode, Jian Shi, to learn more about this new stablecoin.

A Discussion With the Founder of Honestnode

Over the last few years, stablecoins have become a popular vehicle within the cryptocurrency landscape and since the birth of tether (USDT), there’s been a decent number of launched stablecoins on networks like Omni Layer, Ethereum, and Tron. These stablecoins have been collateralized in different ways.

Now the Bitcoin Cash network has a stablecoin called honestcoin (USDH) which was created using the SLP platform by the Honestnode team. USDH is a regulated stablecoin backed 1:1 for U.S. dollars and the Honestnode team aims to build various forms of infrastructure to support the token’s use cases. News.Bitcoin.com spoke with Honestnode founder and CEO, Jian Shi, who discussed how the company plans to bolster the potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions.

News.Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers a little about Honestnode?

Jian Shi: Honestnode has created a regulated and secure stablecoin called honestcoin (USDH), and is building a diverse set of value-added application scenarios and tools to support its end-users. This will provide the Honestnode users with a stablecoin that is truly valuable in both the cryptocurrency world and the real world. Honestnode’s ecosystem consists of six primary products：

Honestcoin (USDH): A regulated stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar. Honestpay: The USDH version of Alipay. HonestOTC: An over-the-counter trading platform for USDH and other leading currencies including fiat currency. Honest Financial: A financial service platform that is a fiduciary receiver for USDH. Honestcard: A physical bank card that backs up the USDH accounts of users. HonestAPI: Allowing third-party applications to easily implement the USDH collection.

Our mission is to unleash the true global power of currency. Honestcoin is a secure, efficient and low-cost way to transfer assets around the world. With Honestcoin, users break through external constraints, remove unnecessary restrictions, and bypass costly intermediaries to maintain total control over their global assets. Honestcoin helps bolster the freedom of money.

BC: What made you decide to use the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network to create a stablecoin?

Jian Shi: As the first regulated stablecoin on the BCH chain, USDH can fill a gap in the BCH ecosystem that lacks a regulated stablecoin. At the same time, Bitcoin Cash supports large blocks, with low transfer fees (about 1 satoshi) and 0 confirmation (instant arrival of small amounts). From the perspective of both transfer fees and speeds, it is superior to the BTC Omni Layer protocol and the ERC20 protocol built on Ethereum.

BC: Can you tell our readers how the USDH stablecoin is backed by your U.S. partner?

Jian Shi: Honestnode works with Koi Compliance, a San Francisco-based provider backed by Binance Labs, to ensure that USDH complies with all applicable legal requirements, including U.S. federal and state money transmission laws and AML/CFT rules. Among other things, USDH follows all requirements of a FinCEN-registered MSB by performing thorough identification verification, due diligence, beneficiary ownership checks, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and regulatory reporting. Additionally, Honestnode works with Cohen LLP to issue audited assertions from time to time to ensure that USDH is backed by USD 1:1.

USDH’s custody system is identical to that of TrueUSD. Specifically, all USD amounts used to purchase USDH are placed into a custody account controlled by Prime Trust LLC, a Nevada-chartered trust company. USDH’s operational staff and management members have no legal claim to such USD collateralization amount.

BC: Were there any regulatory hurdles you had to deal with before launching the Honestcoin (USDH) project?

Jian Shi: There were no regulatory hurdles. The USDH team proactively researched the regulatory framework for fiat-backed stablecoins and related compliance matters and decided to work with established providers such as Prime Trust LLC and Koi Compliance. The launch, therefore, was a smooth process.

BC: Will Honestnode continue dealing with regulators going forward?

Jian Shi: Yes. Honestnode will, for USDH, comply with all applicable legal requirements on an on-going basis. We will, therefore, continue to work with regulators in fulfillment of certain of these obligations (e.g. regulatory reporting and asset blocking).

BC: USDH recently launched on the exchange Coinex. Do you plan to launch on any other exchanges in the future?

Jian Shi: We will gradually enter listings on more mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges in the future. Honestnode is currently focused on building USDH applications in the real world, to solve high-cost payment and remittance issues, and gaining more non-cryptocurrency focused audiences.

After we have accumulated a comfortable number of users in the payment and remittance scenarios, we will expand the USDH’s presence in the cryptocurrency secondary market trading and enter more digital currency exchanges.

BC: You worked with the SLP developers when creating USDH. Can you tell us about this experience?

Jian Shi: It was an unforgettable experience, and we went through the gradual improvement of the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). While the process was challenging and arduous, SLP continued to improve and support us until USDH was released.

There is no doubt that this is a great team and we benefited a lot from their cooperation. At the same time, the development group of SLP is very enthusiastic and helpful. They always welcome new developers and are willing to share various problems encountered in the development process.

BC: Do you think a stablecoin created using Bitcoin Cash is beneficial to BCH?

Jian Shi: As the first stablecoin on BCH, USDH can fill the gap in the BCH ecosystem. We will broaden USDH in the payment and remittance scenarios, which will help increase BCH’s activity. In addition, with the development of SLP and other protocols, there should be more and more applications based on the BCH chain, and USDH can provide access to payment implementation for these applications.

BC: There are a lot of stablecoins now. Do you think it’s good to have a variety?

Jian Shi: From an early age, we learned that Emperor Qin Shi Huang’s unification of the six Chinese nations would be very beneficial at the time, while on the other hand, the super-globalization of the Euro of today reveals many problems and intricacies. So, whether monetary diversity is good or bad cannot merely be decided so quickly. The financial system is highly related to the national policy, the fiscal and tax system, and the economic system.

As Honestnode, we need to stay humble in the face of such an objectively complicated existence and system, to strive to create application scenarios while maintaining the regulation, stability, and efficiency standards. Under the same compliance framework, we are open to other stable currencies and welcome other teams to work with us to resolve the issue of currency segregation.

BC: Do you think USDH is a competitor to other stablecoins like tether (USDT) and Gemini dollar (GUSD)?

At present, the main application scenario of tether is digital currency trade, but the under-regulation of Tether is an existing risk of significance. Whereas, the Gemini dollar is backed by the Gemini exchange, which trades mainly in digital currencies. The USDH is initially positioned to be applied in the real world to solve the problems of high cost and the hindered path in the process of payment and remittance. Because the target market is different from tether and Gemini dollar, there will be no direct competition in the initial stage.

The Indian government has officially released the report by the interministerial committee tasked with proposing crypto measures. The announcement came one day before the country’s supreme court was scheduled to hear the writ petitions against the crypto banking restriction. The report contains the draft bill which proposes a ban on cryptocurrency.

Draft Bill Now Public, Supreme Court Hearing Delayed

The Indian supreme court was scheduled to hear the crypto case on July 23. It was expected to address the banking restriction by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, the case was not heard by the court on Tuesday.

On Monday, the Ministry of Finance published the long-awaited crypto regulatory report by the interministerial committee under the chairmanship of Secretary of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg, who is also the country’s finance secretary. The ministry confirmed that the “Report of the committee to propose specific actions to be taken in relation to virtual currencies” has been submitted to the government. It contains the draft “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019.”

The Ministry of Finance’s announcement reads:

This report and draft bill will now be examined in consultation with all the concerned departments and regulatory authorities before the government takes a final decision.

The report discusses distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), virtual currencies, initial coin offerings, a digital rupee (central bank digital currency), the potential uses of DLT for financial services, and recommendations for both DLTs and cryptocurrency. “The mandate of the committee has been to study various issues pertaining to virtual currencies and to propose specific actions that may be taken in relation thereto,” the report describes.

Full Ban Proposal

The draft entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019,” included in the report submitted by the Garg committee, is an updated version of the one previously leaked, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. However, much of the crypto-related prohibitions and offenses are unchanged.

Following the release of his committee’s report, Garg tweeted on July 22 that “Private cryptocurrencies are of no real value. Rightly banned.”

Noting “extreme fluctuations” in their prices, the committee proposes that “private cryptocurrencies should not be allowed,” stating:

The committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalizing carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India.

The committee believes that private cryptocurrencies have “no underlying intrinsic value” and “lack all the attributes of a currency.” The report adds that “There is no fixed nominal value of these private cryptocurrencies i.e. neither act as any store of value nor they are a medium of exchange.”

Proposed Prohibitions

According to the bill, “No person shall mine, generate, hold, sell, deal in, issue, transfer, dispose of or use cryptocurrency in the territory of India.” In addition to disallowing cryptocurrency for use as “legal tender or currency at any place in India,” the bill proposes that “No person shall directly or indirectly use cryptocurrency in any manner, including as (a) a medium of exchange; and/or (b) a store of value; and/or (c) a unit of account.”

As previously reported, the bill also states that “Whoever directly or indirectly mines, generates, holds, sells, deals in, transfers, disposes of or issues cryptocurrency … shall be punishable with fine or with imprisonment which shall not be less than one year but which may extend up to ten years, or both.” Moreover, “Whoever directly or indirectly promotes, issues any advertisement, solicits, abets or induces any participation in any activity involving the use of cryptocurrency … shall be punishable with fine or imprisonment which may extend up to seven years or both.”

Regarding the RBI ban, the report reveals that the committee “endorses the stand taken by the RBI to eliminate the interface of institutions regulated by the RBI from cryptocurrencies … The committee also recommends that all exchanges, people, traders and other financial system participants should be prohibited from dealing with cryptocurrencies.”

Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, pointed out:

The recommendation report is dated 28th Feb 2019, hopefully, they review again and are asked to submit another recommendation report. A lot has happened globally since then.

Another recommendation the committee made is for the government to establish “a standing committee to take into account the technological developments globally and within the country and also the views of global standard-setting bodies to revisit the issues addressed in the report as and when required.”

Last-Minute Change

The Indian government was initially in favor of regulating cryptocurrency rather than imposing a blanket ban on it, Business Standard reported July 23, noting that Garg pressed for “accepting virtual currencies as an economic phenomenon,” arguing that “regulating it will likely lead to better results.”

The committee first met in November 2017 and broadly agreed that banning would be difficult to implement, opting to focus on determining whether cryptocurrency should be classified as a commodity or a financial asset. They also recognized that a ban may “drive some operators underground, which may encourage [the] use of such ‘currencies’ for illegitimate purposes,” the news outlet cited the minutes of the meeting.

The second meeting took place on Feb. 22 last year, shortly after former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said during his budget speech that cryptocurrency was not legal tender and steps would be taken to eliminate its use. During this meeting, the regulators were in favor of imposing a complete ban on cryptocurrency. Central Board of Direct Taxes Chairman Sushil Chandra said that it creates “a chain of black money,” the publication conveyed.

However, Garg noted that cryptocurrency would be discussed at the G20 meetings and a fresh look might be warranted. He suggested that using crypto in payment systems should not be fully banned, considering the nature of the technology. Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney concurred. The committee decided to form two sets of papers ⁠— one for banning and the other for regulating cryptocurrency. According to the news outlet, during the next meeting held on Jan. 9 ⁠— almost a year later ⁠— the committee agreed upon the draft bill to ban cryptocurrency.

Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway who once called bitcoin ""probably rat poison squared,"" was due to have lunch with Sun on Wednesday, after Sun won a charity auction with a record $4.57 million bid.

Sun had said that he hoped the lunch would ""bridge the gap between institutional and traditional investors and the realm of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.""

""TRON Foundation announces postponement of Warren Buffett lunch, press conferences after founder Justin Sun falls ill with kidney stones,"" said a tweet from the foundation on Monday evening in the United States.

The parties agreed to reschedule at a later date, the tweet added.

Tronix, the foundation's token, dropped 12.3 percent following the news, price data from Coinbase showed.

Buffett is highly skeptical of cryptocurrencies. At Berkshire's annual meeting last month, he likened wagering on bitcoin to betting on zero or double-zero on a Las Vegas roulette wheel.

If, as the saying goes, any publicity is good publicity, then Tuesday was a great day for Tron CEO Justin Sun.

The 28-year-old entrepreneur has been the talk of the crypto community for the last 24 hours, starting with Monday night’s announcement that a bout of kidney stones led him to postpone a long-awaited lunch with finance titan Warren Buffett.

Then came reports suggesting that the rescheduling was due to legal rather than medical problems. For a few hours, seemingly everyone on crypto Twitter believed Sun was in China, barred from leaving by the government amid accusations of lawbreaking.

But that narrative was seemingly debunked in the afternoon, when a live video broadcast showed Sun in what appeared to be a San Francisco high-rise, the Bay Bridge in the background, joking that he wished he were in Miami.

It was a roller-coaster ride befitting the volatile crypto space, where it’s often hard to know what’s real, even by 2019 standards.

Crossover event

Stepping back, the lunch was the prize for winning a charity auction. Sun bid $4.6 million earlier this year and seemingly intended to introduce the notoriously crypto-skeptical Buffett to a number of influential figures in the space. The Glide Foundation, which helps the homeless of San Francisco, received the money on June 5, according to Tron.

As of Monday, Sun had lined up Circle’s Jeremy Allaire, Huobi’s Chris Lee, eToro’s Yoni Assia and litecoin creator Charlie Lee to join him with the Oracle of Omaha on July 25.

The specific subjects to be discussed during the steak meal were not disclosed; however, Buffett has famously called bitcoin “rat poison squared,” and made a number of other unflattering remarks about cryptocurrencies.

Sun, himself a controversial figure, is the creator of the Tron blockchain protocol and head of its namesake foundation. He persuaded Buffett to move the charity lunch from its traditional New York location to the Bay Area.

Then, late Monday, the Tron Foundation announced the postponement, saying Sun had fallen ill with kidney stones and that the parties had “agreed to reschedule at a later date.”

Reports from China

Hours later, a Chinese business news outlet suggested that the matter might not be so straightforward.

The 21st Century Business Herald published an article accusing Sun of illegal fundraising via the Tron project. It also alleged the Tron network operated illegal gambling services accessible to Chinese residents and further took aim at Sun’s early startup Peiwo, a social app, accusing it of illegal involvement in the pornography business.

The media outlet stated that it has confirmed with multiple sources that Justin Sun was inside mainland China.

“Without a clear answer to these questions raised, will Justin be able to have this $4 million meal?” the article asked, implying Sun may not be able to leave the country without addressing the alleged issues.

Shortly afterward, Sun responded via his Weibo account to deny the allegations made by the 21st Century Business Herald.

“The illegal fundraise accusation is wrong. Tron complied with regulators and refunded investors on Sept. 20 in 2017, immediately after the order [of a ban on initial coin offerings] from seven ministries in China,” Sun wrote, adding:

“The Tron foundation is based in Singapore in compliance with local regulations and laws … and does not involve any flow of capital, or any crypto or fiat currency onramp.”

Sun’s response did not include any detail regarding his whereabouts, however, and he did not respond to CoinDesk’s inquiry about his current location.

‘Totally inaccurate’

Then came a second story out of China, this one from an outlet that is often widely cited by Western media.

Caixin, based in Beiling, reported that Sun was under Chinese government control, meaning he was not facing formal charges but was not allowed to leave the country. The article, later published in English translation, repeated some of the allegations from the earlier 21st Century Business Herald story. CoinDesk cited and linked to Caixin’s article in our coverage, as did other news outlets.

A collective groan could be heard throughout the industry.

Guys, seriously. We look ridiculous rn — Hailey Lennon (@HaileyLennonBTC) July 23, 2019

nice job everybody — Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) July 23, 2019

But according to Cliff Edwards, director of global communications at the Tron Foundation, the Caixin story was bunk.

“That report’s totally inaccurate, and we posted a photo, several photos today of Justin in San Francisco,” Edwards told CoinDesk.

Live from SF

To put the matter to rest, Sun broadcast a Periscope video, in which he panned the camera around as evidence of his location, showing off the Bay Bridge – not the Golden Gate Bridge, he noted – in the background.

“I’m not feeling quite well but I think we gonna postpone [the lunch] but definitely looking forward to it,” Sun said, adding:

“It’s pretty comfortable in San Francisco.”

Describing Sun’s current kidney stone episode, Edwards told CoinDesk, “some moments you’re in excruciating pain, some moments you’re fine.”

Tronix, the native token of the Tron network, slid 11 percent Tuesday amid all the confusion. Stellar’s XLM just passed it to become the 10th largest crypto by market capitalization – $1.68 billion versus $1.67 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Tron had scheduled Thursday’s lunch with Buffett to coincide with a party to celebrate the anniversary of the company’s acquisition of BitTorrent. A slate of events is still planned for Thursday, sans Buffett, Edwards confirmed.

A federal judge in Los Angeles, California rejected the telecommunications giant's request to dismiss all of the claims in a suit filed by Michael Terpin last year for enabling the theft of $24 million worth of cryptocurrency. Terpin is seeking $200 million in punitive damages and $24 million of compensatory damages from AT&T.

""The evidence will show that AT&T not once, but twice allowed hackers posing as Michael to obtain his SIM card,"" Terpin's lead counsel Pierce O'Donnell, a partner with Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger in Los Angeles, said in a press release.

The judge tossed out 13 of the 16 claims, finding that Terpin did not adequately show how the theft of his cell phone number was connected to the cryptocurrency claims. AT&T told CNBC in a statement that the company was ""pleased the court dismissed most of the claims"" and ""the plaintiff will have the opportunity to re-plead but we will continue to vigorously contest his claims.""

In a 69-page complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles last summer, the crypto entrepreneur claimed that because of ""AT&T's willing cooperation with the hacker, gross negligence, violation of its statutory duties, and failure to adhere to its commitments in its Privacy Policy,"" nearly $24 million worth of digital currency was lifted from his account. Terpin co-founded an angel group for bitcoin investors called BitAngels in 2013 and a digital currency fund, BitAngels/Dapps Fund.

""We dispute these allegations and look forward to presenting our case in court,"" AT&T told CNBC in a statement.

The suit brought attention to a hacking method known as ""SIM swapping,"" where criminals steal phone numbers and to log into people's cryptocurrency accounts, then transfer money to themselves. Those instances and other high-profile hacks on exchanges caused deep sell-offs in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year. Bitcoin was trading near $9,982 on Tuesday, and has roughly tripled in value since the beginning of this year. It became a household name in December 2017, when it reached a high of nearly $20,000 but has yet to recover to that level since.

Terpin said he was the victim of two hacks within seven months. At the time, he was using AT&T as his service provider and said cryptocurrency was taken through a ""digital identity theft"" of his account. He alleged that an impostor was able to get his phone number from an ""insider cooperating with the hacker"" without the AT&T store employee requiring him to show valid identification or provide a required password. That number was later used to access Terpin's cryptocurrency accounts, according to the complaint.

""What AT&T did was like a hotel giving a thief with a fake ID a room key and a key to the room safe to steal jewelry in the safe from the rightful owner,"" the complaint alleged.

Hacks are not unusual in the fledgling space. The all-time total in cryptocurrency lost by individuals hit $1.5 billion at the end of last year, according to CoinDesk's State of Blockchain Report.

In order to safeguard their money, cybersecurity and industry experts say investors should guard their cellphone numbers with the same paranoia with which they guard their social security numbers. Many crypto investors opt to keep their funds in what's known as ""cold storage."" The method allows you to store digital currency offline, away from any internet access, making it harder to hack.",2019-07-23,https://cointelegraph.com/news/govt-bans-only-make-citizens-want-crypto-more-binance-ceo,"The CEO of top cryptocurrency exchange Binance has said President Trump’s crypto-related tweets can only be a good thing for the industry.

‘The president of the United States is talking about cryptocurrency’

Changpeng Zhao (CZ) told CNBC in an interview published on July 23 that even though Trump has been critical of the asset class in his rhetoric, he has not done anything as of yet that damages the industry. On the contrary, the publicity — coming from the highest echelons of power in the Western political world — in itself is a win for crypto:

“Trump so far has not done anything positive or negative, he’s just said he’s not a fan. The fact that he tweeted about it, and the president of the United States is talking about cryptocurrency, it’s a good thing.”

CZ even entertained the scenario that were Trump to go so far as to outright ban cryptocurrency ownership in the United States, the asset class would prevail, arguing that:

“Cryptocurrency will survive regardless of any one country. Most countries that try to ban bitcoin cause their citizens to want cryptocurrency more.”

The CEO also separately addressed this spring’s $40 million hack of Binance’s hot wallets, arguing that traditional financial institutions remain culpably more opaque in regard to such incidents:

“Banks get hacked but they’re not transparent with the numbers. You see billions of dollars in fines for banks. Whereas with cryptocurrency there’s more transparency, which is actually good for the users because now they know what’s going on.”

Trump tweets and regulators muscle in

Ahead of CZ’s comments, the CEO of another industry-leading trading platform — Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong — had similarly characterized the president’s crypto-dedicated tweets as being “yuge” for the industry, an opinion that was shared by a host of crypto space commentators:

“Achievement unlocked! I dreamt about a sitting U.S. president needing to respond to growing cryptocurrency usage years ago. ‘First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.’ We just made it to step 3 y'all.”

To recall, Trump tweeted that he was “not a fan” of “Unregulated Crypto Assets” (capitals in the original), underscoring their potential use in the drug trade and other illicit activities.

Meanwhile, Capitol Hill has been grilling social media titan Facebook on its planned cryptocurrency project Libra, homing in on concerns such as privacy, trust and regulatory compliance. Beyond the U.S., the G7 finance ministers have been voicing concerns over what they perceive to be the potentially systemic financial risks of Facebook’s plans.",,https://bitcoinist.com/iran-gives-nod-to-cryptocurrency-mining/,"Bitcoin Regulation Iran Gives Nod to Cryptocurrency Mining

Iran’s government has given the green light to a cryptocurrency mining mechanism, thus recognizing the Bitcoin and crypto industry, local media portal TehranTimes reported on Monday, citing news agency Mehr.

Crypto Mining Has Legal Grounds in Iran

It’s official – the Iranian governments’ economic committee on Sunday said yes to a cryptocurrency mining mechanism. The decision is a natural result of Iran’s plans to frame the rapidly expanding mining farms into its legal system.

Abdolnaser Hemmati, Governor of Central Bank of Iran (CBI), stated:

The government’s economic committee has approved a mechanism for mining digital coins and it will later be put to discussion at a cabinet meeting.

Besides approving a crypto mining approach, the economic committee officially recognized the crypto industry. The committee’s head Elyas Hazrati commented:

We do believe that cryptocurrency industry should be recognized as an official industry in Iran to let the country take advantage of its tax and customs revenues.

Iran Elaborates Electricity Pricing Scheme for Miners

The crypto mining industry has been surrounded by uncertainties for months, as the government couldn’t decide whether to approve the industry or not. Due to the low-priced electricity in the country, many crypto mining farms have expanded at a fast pace.

On Sunday, the government established an electricity pricing scheme for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency miners, though we don’t know the exact prices as stipulated in the scheme. Also, the cabinet will have the last word on the pricing plan.

Deputy Minister of Energy Homayun Haeri said:

A plan to apply the exported electricity rate for mining farms was approved by the government’s economic committee and will soon be discussed and voted on by the cabinet.

Meanwhile, Elyas Hazrati explained the benefits of endorsing crypto miners. He said that the gained income might be used for buying foreign currencies under US sanctions and minimize their negative consequences.

Step-by-step, Iran’s stance on cryptocurrencies makes a u-turn. At the beginning of the year, the country lifted the ban on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

A Good Example for India

Iran’s approach might be a good example for other countries that cannot decide on how to regulate the crypto industry. For instance, India is currently working on a regulatory scheme related to Bitcoin and its brethren. However, it seems that the final decision might be a total ban on Bitcoin and crypto trading.

If India follows in the footsteps of China by cracking down on Bitcoin operations, it might lose many great benefits. Regulating the industry might be a win-win for both the government and the market participants.

",,https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-nydfs-division-will-oversee-licensing-for-crypto-startups,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the financial regulator for the state of New York, is moving its in-house team supervising cryptocurrency businesses to a new division.

In a statement Tuesday, Linda Lacewell, the newly appointed superintendent, announced the Research and Innovation Division at the Department of Financial Services will track emerging financial technologies and be “responsible for licensing and supervising virtual currencies.”

This will include licensing approvals made under the state’s BitLicense, a regulatory regime that governs firms buying, selling or issuing cryptocurrencies to consumers in the state, the agency affirmed in a follow-up request for comment.

“This division will oversee the virtual currency licensing process and will encourage development in the area,” the NYDFS said.

Lacewell’s predecessor, Maria T. Vullo, opposed regulatory experimentation for non-banking financial firms when leading the agency, marking this research and innovation division as a reprieve from the regulator’s formerly heavy hand.

Lacewell said:

“The financial services regulatory landscape needs to evolve and adapt as innovation in banking, insurance and regulatory technology continues to grow.”

The NYDFS has been regulating companies in the crypto space in 2015, when its BitLicense program came into effect. The regime has been attacked by industry entrepreneurs including ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees, who once said: “Here we are two miles from the Statue of Liberty and you cannot sell CryptoKitties in the state without that license. That’s the absurdity of what’s happened here.”

The agency reportedly only granted eight BitLicenses in the first three years following its implementation. Currently over 20 licenses have been granted to cryptocurrency firms.

Lacewell most recently approved two subsidiaries of the crypto exchange Seed CX to operate in the state under the BitLicense framework.

Named executives

Four executives were named in the announcement, all with backgrounds in governmental work.

At the helm of the organization is executive deputy superintendent Matthew Homer, who most recently worked at fintech startup Plaid.

The current director of research, Olivia Bumgardner, will also join the division as deputy superintendent. In her tenure at the state’s financial watchdog, Bumgardner has led initiatives involving digital assets and cybersecurity. Matthew Siegel, attorney in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, will serve as a deputy superintendent, and Andrew Lucas, director for the Office of Financial Innovation, will serve as counsel.

Speaking to the appointments, Lacewell said:

“This new division and these appointments position DFS as the regulator of the future, allowing the Department to better protect consumers, develop best practices, and analyze market data to strengthen New York’s standing as the center of financial innovation.”

Crypto is Americans’ 7th most popular long-term investment

According to the results of a nationwide Bankrate survey, published on July 17, 9% of millennials chose crypto as their top long-term investment option — roughly threefold the percentage among earlier generations.

More broadly, the survey revealed that cryptocurrencies are the seventh most popular investment option among Americans — with 4% of respondents choosing them as their top choice for a minimum 10-year investment. This 4% figure was lower than the 5% of respondents who chose “None” in response to a list of assets they would choose to invest their cash in the long term.

The most popular asset class was real estate, at 31% — notwithstanding the 2008 real estate crash and expected slowdown this year.

Fresh crypto surveys

As reported yesterday, 49% of Americans and Brits have revealed they would not trust Facebook in regards to its much-anticipated stablecoin Libra, citing privacy concerns.

A spring 2019 survey indicated that 11% of the American population owns Bitcoin (BTC), indicating that Bitcoin ownership is a “demographic mega-trend” led by the younger generation in the 18-34 year age range. Nonetheless, 89% of U.S. citizens had heard of the cryptocurrency, regardless of their generation.

That same month, a separate survey found that approximately 3% of American retirees own bitcoin.

Meanwhile, a survey from earlier this month suggested that 26% of Generation Z — generally defined as those born after 1997 — would be somewhat, very or extremely likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next 6 months.",

Supreme Court Hearing Slightly Delayed

The Indian supreme court has rescheduled hearing the crypto case, originally scheduled for July 23 but was not heard on that date. The court is expected to address the writ petitions against the central bank’s crypto restriction as well as the report by the interministerial committee with recommended crypto measures and draft crypto bill. On July 24, the court set a new tentative date of Aug. 2 but later updated it to July 25 for all five pending crypto writ petitions.

Update: The court did not hear the crypto case on July 25. The case is now listed on the court’s website for July 29. This article will be updated with a new hearing date if there are more changes.

Year-Long Battle

It has been a long struggle for the Indian crypto community since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular in April last year banning regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect in July last year and banks subsequently closed accounts of crypto exchanges.

Soon after the issuance of the circular, several industry stakeholders filed writ petitions to challenge the ban. The Indian supreme court was scheduled to hear all crypto-related petitions in September last year, but the case was repeatedly postponed.

Meanwhile, a number of crypto businesses have had to shut down due to the lack of banking access. At least four crypto exchanges fell victim of the ban. Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, shut down its local exchange operations in September last year. Earlier this year, Coindelta announced its shutdown, followed by Coinome, and Koinex.

On June 24, Cryptokart exchange also announced that it is shutting down this month. Founder Gaurang Poddar explained that since the RBI ban took effect:

The general interest in crypto in India has tanked. Also since the government isn’t going to introduce any regulations and leave it grey for a while, it just makes any long term planning difficult.

Committee’s Recommendations

The Indian government has been formulating crypto measures since 2017. A high-level interministerial committee was constituted on Nov. 2, 2017 to study all aspects of cryptocurrency and provide recommendations.

This committee is under the chairmanship of Finance Secretary and Secretary of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg. It comprises Shri Ajay Prakash Sawhney, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology; Shri Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India; and Shri B.P. Kanungo, Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India.

Garg himself said several times that the report was ready but it was never made public until now. On July 22, the finance ministry finally published this report on its website, but the report itself is dated Feb. 28. It contains a draft bill on cryptocurrency entitled Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019. According to the report, “The mandate of the committee has been to study various issues pertaining to virtual currencies and to propose specific actions that may be taken in relation thereto.”

The committee met three times before publishing the report and draft bill on cryptocurrency ⁠— on Nov. 27, 2017; Feb. 22, 2018; and Jan. 9. Representatives of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the Central Board of Direct Taxes, and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology also participated.

The report details that “the committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalizing carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India.” News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the bill’s proposed prohibitions and offenses.

Following the publication of his committee’s report, Garg tweeted:

Committee is very receptive and supportive of distributed ledger technologies and recommends its widespread use in delivering financial services … Private crypto currencies are of no real value. Rightly banned.

Comments flooded his Twitter account in response, challenging many of his findings such as the definition of private cryptocurrencies.

According to the minutes of the committee’s meetings, Garg was in favor of regulating cryptocurrency in the first meeting but changed his mind by the third meeting. The committee also recommends the government set up a standing committee. The Finance Ministry described:

As virtual currencies and its underlying technology are still evolving, the group has proposed that the Government may establish a Standing Committee to revisit the issues addressed in the report as and when required.

Crypto Currently Not Banned in India

While Garg’s tweet could be misconstrued that crypto is already banned in India, many people in the community were quick to point out that his committee has merely proposed a ban and the draft bill is not yet law. There are many steps this bill needs to go through before it becomes law.

The Indian government has also confirmed that cryptocurrency is currently not banned in the country. On July 16, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, told Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian parliament, that the government has not prohibited cryptocurrency in the country. He additionally clarified that “Presently, there is no separate law for dealing with issues relating to cryptocurrencies. Hence, all concerned departments and law enforcement agencies, such as RBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax authorities, etc. take action as per the relevant existing laws.”

The verdict is in—personal accounts are at risk of being closed, and accounts for cryptocurrency-related businesses are outright prohibited. Here are some solutions.

We went to four leading U.S. banks and two credit unions to determine their receptiveness to doing business with cryptocurrency users. Posing as a customer, we tried to open an account for depositing wages earned in Bitcoin, converted via Coinbase. We then inquired whether the account was at risk of closure based on each bank’s risk management policies.

Afterward, we looked into the possibility of opening an account for a fictitious Seattle-based business, CryptoMedia. The business would sometimes send and receive payments in Bitcoin but would have no other direct involvement with crypto.

U.S. Bank

Of the six banks we visited, U.S. Bank was the most hostile toward opening an account that deals in cryptocurrency. The junior banker was unable, or unwilling, to answer more nuanced questions about the bank’s risk management policies.

Immediately after mentioning cryptocurrency the banker escalated the issue to management. Several phone calls later, the banker stated that opening a personal account that interacts with a cryptocurrency exchange would mark the account as high risk and would be at a “substantial” risk of being closed.

Any business remotely involving cryptocurrency is strictly prohibited based on the bank’s policies. This means businesses involving mining, media, and even marketing cannot open an account at U.S. Bank.

At least four other customers reported having their accounts closed after U.S. Bank identified these customers’ involvement with cryptocurrency.

Bank of America

Bank of America was the most helpful in answering questions about opening an account that would interact with crypto. The bank escalated the issue to upper management, and had a branch manager answer questions in-person. Unlike other bankers we talked to, this manager had a much more nuanced understanding of the regulations the bank was subject to.

First, inquiries about the risk of account closure were escalated to three different departments of risk management during the meeting. The calls took over an hour and all three yielded inconclusive results. The manager did reveal the following documents about the bank’s internal compliance policies, written as follows:

“Cryptocurrency exchanges or digital currency exchanges (DCE) are businesses that allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies, virtual or digital currencies, for other assets.

…

“Cryptocurrencies present inherent risks including speculative and volatile asset values. Transactions involving cryptocurrency may exhibit a lack of transparency in the end-to-end movement of funds.”

Keywords that will flag an account as high risk:

Cryptocurrency

Virtual currency

Digital currency

Bitcoin

Ethereum

XRP

Blockchain

Digital gold currency

“Do not open accounts for cryptocurrency exchanges or businesses whose primary business is the trading of, or investment in, cryptocurrency, virtual currency, or digital currency whether as agent or principal.”

Even after escalating the issue, the manager was unable to confirm that the personal account would not be closed. Instead, the banker recommended opening an account at a smaller bank and then transferring funds to break the link between the cryptocurrency exchange and the account, consequently reducing the risk of account closure.

Bank of America’s stance was consistent with customer reports of account closures. We identified five instances where a customer reported their account was closed for interacting with cryptocurrency.

Wells Fargo

Initially, the assistant branch manager said that Wells Fargo would not open a personal account that has any connection to cryptocurrency. However, when pressed, the banker escalated the issue to upper management for clarification.

Several phone calls later the Wells Fargo representative said that opening an account that “transacts directly to and from Coinbase would probably be okay, but I can’t promise it won’t get closed.”

Phone calls to upper management appeared to be unhelpful, with their compliance team unable to articulate the bank’s stance on cryptocurrency for personal accounts (in line with the other three banks).

Ultimately, the manager was unable to answer any questions related to the bank’s compliance policies, or even answer questions about opening a personal account that “does business with Bitcoin.” Furthermore, the assistant branch manager demanded that we come back tomorrow, “at the earliest,” before opening an account in order to double-check with management.

For business accounts though, Wells Fargo’s policy is clear: Anything cryptocurrency-related is outright prohibited, according to the banker. Compared to other banks Wells Fargo and its internal compliance documents seem ill-equipped to handle customers who deal in crypto.

Chase Bank

Of the four major banks, the “personal banker” at Chase was the quickest at answering questions on Chase’s compliance policies. The banker revealed the (quite terse) internal compliance guidelines on crypto to CryptoSlate:

“Opening a cryptocurrency account for businesses is prohibited.”

The guideline had one bullet-point, simply citing “Bitcoin.” In contrast, other prohibited activities, such as those related to marijuana and gambling, had at least four or more points with corresponding guidance.

That said, the banker said they could open an account immediately, but was uncertain, even after calling the Chase risk management team, whether the account would get flagged.

“The compliance team monitors all account activity, so there’s still the potential your account gets closed,” the banker said.

We found five reports of customers claiming to have their accounts closed for transacting in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.

Major banks don’t know what to do about cryptocurrency

Interactions from these four major bank branches indicate that none of the mainstream banks have a clear stance toward customers who personally use cryptocurrency. Even then, from the evidence gathered, these banks have draconian policies toward crypto users, flagging them as “high risk.”

Owning and transacting in Bitcoin in the United States is legal. Entities such as Coinbase also comply with U.S. know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations. Nevertheless, the major banks still have unfavorable policies toward crypto-users, and are outright hostile toward crypto-businesses.

Credit unions receptive to Bitcoin

In addition to visiting these four major U.S. banks, we also attempted to open accounts at Boeing Employee Credit Union and Washington State Employee Credit Union.

Because credit unions are much smaller than traditional banks, and often operated as not-for-profits, they are governed by much more lenient state and federal regulations. Consequently, they tend to have much more relaxed risk management departments. We hypothesized they would be more receptive to Bitcoin and crypto than their larger counterparts.

Our in-branch visits confirmed our hypothesis. Both banks confirmed with their compliance teams that they do not have a stance for or against Bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Not only were we able to open personal accounts at both banks successfully, but BECU and WSECU were willing to also open accounts for crypto-businesses—which all four of the major banks prohibit.

Compelled to act

Bitcoin was unleashed 10 years ago. Now, the idea that cryptocurrency is a wise investment is penetrating the mainstream. In a July Bankrate survey, 4 percent of Americans (and 9 percent of millenials) indicated that BTC and cryptocurrency “would be the best investment” if the money wasn’t needed for 10 or more years.

It seems traditional financial insitutitions have yet to catch up with changing customer preferences. If the number of Americans using BTC continues to grow then the big banks will be compelled to take a stance.

Is hodling currently at its highest?

Per the report, the amount of BTC held in a single address unmoved for at least five years recently reached its all-time high. More precisely, on July 19, the number of coins meeting this requirement reached 3,847,859 BTC.

Coinmetrics claims that this suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly becoming a store of value, as opposed to a medium of exchange. Coinmetrics further calculated that the previously specified number of coins amount to 21.6% of the total supply, which is also a five-year-high.

Untouched supply mirrors price movements

Other data provided by Coinmetrics also suggests that unmoved supply tends to mirror price movements. The report points out that “untouched supply tends to peak towards the bottom of a price trough, and vice versa.”

Altcoins see more losses and fewer gains than BTC

Per the report, while Bitcoin has seen two peaks (one at $13,800, another one at $13,000) before two sharp corrections, altcoins have seen less upside movements and far more losses. While Bitcoin has reportedly lost about 2% of its value, Ethereum (ETH) has seen a 28% decrease, Litecoin (LTC) 32%, Ripple (XRP) 31%, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) 38% and EOS 44%.

The movement of crypto capital from altcoins to Bitcoin, according to Coinmetrics, is partly motivated by the increasing crypto regulatory turmoil in the United States. The analysis cites the Commodity Futures Trading Commission investigation into crypto exchange BitMex, and the Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit against the Kin Foundation over the Kin token as examples.

Coinmetrics claims that all of this motivates cryptocurrency investors to move their funds to Bitcoin, given its better regulatory clarity. Furthermore, geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic factors paired with increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value further provide further long-term support to Bitcoin prices.

The analysis cites the U.S.-China trade war, threats of disruption of oil supplies from the Middle East, the risk of fragmentation of the Eurozone (including the possibility of Italy leaving the EU) and tensions in Hong Kong as geopolitical factors for increased hodling. On the other hand, the cited macroeconomic factors are lower real interest rates on major currencies and the expected start of a monetary easing cycle by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China.

It’s not only regulators that are hampering Facebook’s crypto party. Now, somewhat ironically, the social media giant is dealing with Facebook Libra impersonators as well.



Fake Facebook Libra Ads Surge

As if Zuckerberg and his team didn’t have enough to contend with as governments around the world scramble to halt the project. Now, receiving a dose of its own medicine, the social media giant is facing what the Washington Post calls “waves” of fraudulent pages.

This will be a major test as to whether Facebook can prove to regulators that it can combat the fraud that will certainly surround its new payment system.

As of Monday of this week, at least a dozen fake accounts, groups, and pages had already appeared on Facebook and Instagram. They’re all purporting to sell Libra coins at a discount–even though Facebook’s coin isn’t available yet.

Buy Libra Coins at a Discounted Price They Say

The company has been swift to react and remove the majority of fake pages, but unfortunately it’s like shovelling snow while it’s still snowing. Not only are these pages and websites becoming more prevalent, but the are also getting significantly more sophisticated. The phishing scam website, BuyLibraCoins.com, for example, has a particularly slick website design:

It’s offering people to take part in the presale and buy Libra coins easily with BTC, ETH, LTC, or even a credit card. With a Switzerland domicile, this website even has a copy of the whitepaper, a Libra referral program, roadmap, and various informative infographics. But be warned, this IS a scam.

Kudos to these scammers, it’s an incredibly good-looking site. But we don’t recommend visiting it. When I tried on my PC, thankfully Metamask averted me to the fact that the site was already on its warning list as an Etherscam.

It’s a good thing that entities such as the Washington Post and Metamask have been so vigilant when it comes to fraudsters.

Facebook itself has so far failed to identify most of the fake Libra pages on its own. This will do little to boost its case against regulators- or confidence in potential consumers.

Facebook’s Crypto Ad Ban – Oh, the Irony

The irony certainly won’t be lost on thousands of ICO projects that were prohibited from advertising on the platform in early 2018.

According to Facebook at the time, the company wanted to protect users against misleading projects and “deceptive promotional practices.” Exactly what Facebook is experiencing now.

This dichotomy was evident in the proposals submitted on July 22 by an inter-ministerial committee set up to study the ecosystem. The report admitted that the distributed-ledger technology behind digital currencies can have positive effects if deployed in financial services, but their most popular application, cryptocurrencies, have “risks associated with them”.

Committee is very receptive and supportive of distributed ledger technologies and recommends its widespread use in delivering financial services. It also opens up door for a possible official digital rupee. Private crypto currencies are of no real value. Rightly banned. — Subhash Chandra Garg (@SecretaryDEA) July 22, 2019

Consequently, the panel, headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, has suggested that India must consider introducing an official virtual currency, or the “Digital Rupee”, to replace private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

Besides Garg, the panel included members from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India. The Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, will now be reviewed by the Narendra Modi government after consulting various regulatory authorities.

While the government has, in the past, made its dislike for cryptocurrencies clear, it remains to be seen if it can still tap the power of distributed-ledger technology, as recommended by the panel.

Can’t deny merits

As opposed to traditional ledgers, which store records of financial transactions in a centralised database, distributed-ledger technology uses local electronic ledgers that synchronise and share the data. The elimination of central record keeping makes financial transactions operationally more efficient and secure.

The Garg panel said distributed-ledger technology “will play a major role in ushering in of the digital age”, and recommended its use in trade financing, improving access to credit, and lowering the compliance costs for know your customer requirements.

The Ministry of Electronics can explore mechanisms through which customer information can be maintained using distributed-ledger technology through a consent-based mechanism, the report said. It added, “The distributed-ledger technology-based systems can be used by banks and other financial firms for processes such as loan-issuance tracking, collateral management, fraud detection and claims management in insurance, and reconciliation systems in the securities market”.

While the financial uses of distributed-ledger technology are still limited, it is its application to virtual currencies that is more evolved.

However, on the question of an official digital currency, too, the Garg panel is in two minds.

While the committee has recommended keeping an open mind regarding the introduction of a digital rupee, it has flagged concerns relating to central bank digital currencies. “It is unclear whether there is a clear advantage in the context of India to come up with an official digital currency,” the panel said.

The decision on launching the digital rupee must consider its impact on existing payments infrastructure and financial stability, the report said. The ability of banks and other lenders to deal with the disruptions caused due to the introduction of central bank digital currencies must also be factored in. If India introduces an official virtual currency, therefore, the Reserve Bank of India must be its appropriate regulator, the report said.

Private cryptocurrencies “have no intrinsic value and cannot replace fiat currencies”, it added, recommending measures that could potentially destroy the crypto-ecosystem.

The clampdown

The Garg panel recommends penalty and imprisonment for those who directly or indirectly “mine, generate, hold, sell, deal in, transfer, dispose of or issues cryptocurrency”.

These activities can attract fines ranging between Rs 1 lakh for non-commercial dealings in virtual currencies and Rs 25 crore for commercial dealings and imprisonment of between one and 10 years.

The report noted that private cryptocurrencies have not been recognised as legal tender in any jurisdiction.

In July 2018, the RBI forbade banks from having any business relationship with virtual currencies, which the Garg panel endorsed in its report. A case against the central bank diktat filed by crypto bourses in India was scheduled to be heard in the Supreme Court on July 23.

The crypto-community, meanwhile, took to social media to garner support against the draft proposals.

This article first appeared on Quartz.",,https://www.verdict.co.uk/cryptocurrencies-51-attack/,"Cryptocurrency entered mainstream consciousness in December 2017 when Bitcoin’s value was nearing what would become its all time high, which was just shy of $20,000 per coin. Others, called altcoins, were buoyed by this rising tide and also reached previously unfathomable prices. People even started to take out home equity loans to buy into the craze, quite likely to their financial advisers’ dismay.

Their popularity was based on the fact they were billed as a safe, albeit not necessarily stable, payment platform. Thanks to strong cryptography, in theory it should be impossible for someone to be able to manufacture their own ‘coins’, steal someone else’s, or reverse any transactions. And in most cases this is true, but there are other ways than breaking cryptography to steal them.

In January this year, one attacker exploited a flaw found in the majority of cryptocurrencies and made off with $1.1m in Ethereum Classic, the second most valuable of them all. This so-called 51% attack highlights a critical vulnerability which has actually been present since the technology’s inception and which will, over time, only get worse.

So, what exactly are these cyber currencies and how do they work in financial transactions?

Bitcoin was first launched about ten years ago and was the first example of cryptocurrency. It used a blockchain as a distributed public ledger. This is a database which is collectively shared and synchronized across multiple sites and allows money transactions to have ‘witnesses’ and without the use of any centralised bank.

A ‘distributed’ ledger contains hundreds of thousands of ‘nodes’ (a connection device), which all participate by validating and storing the ledger. Anyone can take part in the management of the blockchain by forming or ‘spinning up’ their own node. Other examples of cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, as mentioned, as well as the privacy-focused Monero and the speed-focused Litecoin.

How transactions are added

Most cryptocurrencies use a system called ‘Proof of Work’ (PoW) to build a consensus on what the correct blockchain is. The process of adding blocks of transactions to this chain is called mining and the nodes which participate are called miners.

At a high level the process operates in the following ways:

First, a mining node receives transactions and validates them to make sure there is no double spend, for example, spending the same funds twice in different transactions. The nodes then bundle up a number of transactions into a block. At the end of the block, they add a transaction which gives them an amount of cryptocurrency as payment for their work.

Finally, the node begins trying to mine the block into the blockchain. In the PoW process, this intentionally involves very difficult maths which is computationally expensive. Miners compete against each other to solve the problem which adds their block and the first miner to solve the maths gets a reward of some coins.

The miner who finds the solution to the maths problem ‘announces’ their mined block into the network and other nodes then verifies the solution and the new block is added to the chain.

‘Forks’ are created when two different miners come up with two different, but acceptable, solutions and then mine two valid blocks. Over time one will become longer as the majority of nodes add blocks to it and the longest one is accepted as the correct version and the remaining one is abandoned.

PoW blockchains rely on the honest majority, meaning that a majority of mining power must follow the intended blockchain’s mining behaviour. For large cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, with up to hundreds of thousands of nodes, it is prohibitively expensive to amass enough computing power to control this majority under either a single person’s or organisations’ control, which keeps the ledger safe from attack.

Enter Ethereum

This altcoin was introduced in 2015 and expanded the idea of a public transaction ledger from just distributed financial transactions to distributed computing.

This is where nodes on the network participate in a decentralised virtual machine and use scripted functions to build fully distributed applications. Crypto mining scripts are a function that is placed on a website and makes use of a website visitor’s central processing unit (CPU) to mine the cryptocurrencies.

Over the last four years, developers have built applications on the Ethereum network from cat-trading game, CryptoKitties, to an investment platform called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO).

A year after Ethereum was introduced, however, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DAO’s underlying code to siphon off $550m in Ether, the cryptocurrency which drives the Ethereum blockchain.

Because blockchains are immutable meaning that fixed and invariable transactions cannot be reversed, the only way to reverse this was to ‘hard fork’. This fork essentially went back in time, negated the attacker’s transactions and created a new version of the blockchain. It’s highly controversial to do this because it goes against one of the core tenants of the technology, its immutability. But due to the scale of the hack, a majority of the nodes agreed to fork so the majority rule succeeded and Ethereum continued on its new branch.

Yet from this, because a substantial number of nodes disagreed with the hard fork and continued on with the original chain, hack included, Ethereum Classic came about and the pair still exist as separate but related chains.

The 51% attack

Cryptocurrency values began to crash last year with many altcoins becoming unprofitable. This was due to the fact that mining them isn’t free. Mining nodes convert electricity into computation power in order to solve the complex maths problems involved, so if the cost of the electricity outweighs the rewards earned for successfully mining a block, it doesn’t make any financial sense to keep on with that particular currency. This in turn will lead to a drop in mining power, meaning less participants and less of a majority, which then led to the Jan 7th attack when an attacker exploited the drop in power.

The attacker sent several transactions worth from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars in Ethereum Classic to several different wallets, which are a device, physical medium, program or service, which stores the public and/or private keys and can be used to track ownership, receive or spend the cryptocurrencies.

He then traded these funds for a different cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and started mining a separate copy of the blockchain, but this time without the original transactions, depositing Ethereum Classic into the exchanges and therefore being able to maintain a majority of the mining power – 51% or above. That meant this version of the chain caught up and overtook the original’s in length.

Basically, the attacker never sent the Ethereum Classic to the exchanges but still controlled the blockchain, as well as keeping the different cryptocurrency from the old one.

In summary, a 51% attack allows the hacker to double spend their funds. In this case, spending it once to purchase a different cryptocurrency and then regaining it to spend again. The recipient of the original transaction has their funds stolen when the blockchain is reorganised and the transaction removed.

One of the victims of this attack, Gate.io had $100,000 worth of Ethereum Classic stolen and Coinbase about $1.1m.

Are major cryptocurrencies vulnerable?

In technical terms, all the cryptocurrencies that use PoW are vulnerable to a 51% attack, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero. Practically, the computing power needed to do this is astronomical. For this attack, mining power from a cloud provider like NiceHash could have been bought.

It’s worth noting that an attack like this would need to maintain 8TH/s (8,000,000,000,000 hashed per second) and NiceHash charges about $15,000 per day for 1TH/s, so this could cost $120,000 for a full day, which is enough time to execute a double spend of this type.

Therefore, these attacks are a serious risk to smaller cryptocurrencies as it is economically feasible for an attacker to rent enough mining power to take many of them over. One of the things holding them back, however, is that they are almost guaranteed to crash the value of a currency, which is smaller than Ethereum Classic.

What are the fixes?

Although larger cryptocurrencies may all but be immune to attacks like these, it isn’t stopping changes being implemented, which can help impede them. An example is Ethereum, as well as others, that are moving towards a process called Proof-of-Stake, which mitigates attacks by destroying the funds the attacker is trying to steal.

Smaller currencies could still be in trouble though, because while people still put funds into new and cheaper ones in the hope of striking gold during a surge in value, there are still serious risks. Cryptocurrencies are still essentially in the realms of the Wild West and should, as a result, be treated with careful consideration.

Bitcoin price action could hit a massive $42,000 figure by the end of this year, the CEO of crypto investment firm and hedge fund Pantera Capital thinks.

Bitcoin Price Trend Line Can Lead To Huge Gains

Speaking on the latest episode of the Unchained Podcast on July 23, Dan Morehead said that the firm was sticking by its trusted Bitcoin price analysis to determine future performance.

This, he confirmed, includes the possibility of BTC/USD hitting $356,000 in 2021 if its historical compound annual growth rate persists.

At the bottom of the 2018 bear market, when Bitcoin traded at $3100, Pantera considered what growth would be if the price returned to its historical trend line and then kept up that performance in future years.

“That put Bitcoin at $42,000 at the end of 2019, which I know sounds crazy, but essentially we’re halfway back there,” Morehead said.

“It’s right on the trend line, and I think it’s a good shot that by the end of the year, we hit that, and then if you just extrapolate that line out for another year, it’s $122,000 per Bitcoin and in one more year $356,000[.]”

Morehead: Markets Will Accept ‘Crazy’ Price Increases

Bitcoin’s volatile last few weeks has concerned analysts who were already considering where the three-month-long bull market which began in April would end.

Currently trading under $9800, Bitcoin is now 30% below its recent highs of $13,800, challenging even other, less optimistic, prediction models which put it at $21,000 by the end of the year.

As Bitcoinist noted, $9800 support is all that stopped markets from falling further this week, as traders nurse 11% monthly losses.

For Morehead, however, the psychology behind bigger numbers for the Bitcoin price has already proven its nature.

“…($42,000, $122,000 and $356,000) sound crazy, but (in) our first research piece that we wrote on Bitcoin, we predicted it would go to $5000, and when it was at 100 bucks, everyone thought that was totally nuts, but these numbers, in 2 or 3 years, people look back and go, oh yeah, that makes sense,” he continued.

Similar logic could lend weight to some of the boldest Bitcoin price forecasts still on the market, including John McAfee’s infamous $1 million bet with himself.

Others, such as investor Tim Draper’s $250,000 price tag by 2023, also ensure Morehead is not alone in his bullish outlook.

The regulations will require cryptocurrency businesses to hold a Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)-issued license, Cointelegraph Deutschland reported on July 24.

Possible innovation obstruction

Per the report, the new regulations will require cryptocurrency-related businesses such as exchanges and wallet providers to be licensed by BaFin and comply with AML regulation, since crypto assets will be considered a financial instrument starting on January 1, 2020. According to local media FAZ, Bundestag Free Democratic Party Frank member Schäffler commented suggesting that the government is hurting local innovation and forcing crypto businesses to move to other EU states.

Some welcomed regulatory clarity in Germany

On the other hand, Christian Schmies, partner of the law firm Hengeler Mueller, welcomed the regulation suggesting that more clarity will allow for further growth in the industry. According to him, “the technology has not yet been accepted by institutional investors because a reliable legal framework is missing.” While Schmies considers the classification as a financial instrument to be a step in the right direction, he also notes that the space still needs more clarity.

Due to the ICO boom, thousands of new ERC-20 altcoins were created on the Ethereum blockchain to take advantage of both the influx of capital from retail investors hoping to get rich and the coming industry hype and growth.

But now that the ICO boom has ended, demand for Ethereum to use to fund ICOs has dropped, causing the cryptocurrency to drop as much as 94% from its previous all-time high, and is still down 85% from the number even though Bitcoin reclaimed most of its all-time high. But the discrepancy in reclaiming lost gains may end soon enough, as crypto analysts have discovered a potential pattern in Ethereum price charts that could cause Ethereum to increase 1000% relative to Bitcoin.

Ethereum Price Ready for 1000% Gains on BTC Ratio?

Back in 2017, early crypto investors experienced an “alt season” that sent the prices of crypto altcoins like Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin skyrocketing in relation to their Bitcoin ratios, and as a result, their USD value. Lighting struck twice again as Bitcoin set a new all-time high, and these alternative crypto assets set one as well, both in USD and BTC values.

But since the first week of 2018, altcoins have only fallen steadily in their ratio against Bitcoin, and have recently begun to capitulate as investors cashed out underperforming altcoins for the previously parabolic Bitcoin.

Bitcoin has grown so much in price, yet assets like Ethereum are still down 85% from their all-time high. If the current ratios are maintained, even if Bitcoin went all the way to $100,000 altcoins would never again see a new all-time high.

But crypto analysts think otherwise and have spotted a potential pattern in Ethereum price charts that if it plays out, would cause Ethereum to rise 1000% on its BTC ratio.

In a similar-looking chart shared by two separate crypto analysts, past Ethereum high and low cycles can be seen, and the pattern might hint at what Ethereum price will do in the coming months ahead.

Should these patterns play out, the promise of alt season may finally become a reality, and Ethereum could possibly lead the charge as one of the major altcoins with the most ground to regain. However, if ratios were to stay the same, and Bitcoin were to crash significantly, Ethereum may still be a far ways off from setting a new USD all-time high, even if it sets one again in BTC ratio.",2019-07-25 20:00:56+00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/instead-of-lunch-with-warren-buffett-chinese-entrepreneur-eats-humble-pie/2019/07/25/b6370728-ae94-11e9-9411-a608f9d0c2d3_story.html,"“The bidding stemmed from my admiration for Mr. Buffett and my commitment to philanthropy . . . and of course, my self-interest and the exterior motive of advocating for the blockchain industry,” Sun said in a long-form open letter posted Thursday on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, explaining why he paid millions of dollars in an auction to have a meal with the Oracle of Omaha.

“But my immaturity, hubris, blundering, and neglect of public responsibilities have produced unexpected consequences totally contrary to my original intentions . . . and triggered concerns from regulatory authorities,” he wrote.

Every year, Buffett raises money for the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco-based charity that aids the poor and homeless, by offering an opportunity for the highest bidder to have lunch with him.

Sun, a 28-year-old who founded the cryptocurrency company Tron, won the auction in June with his record bid. Tron had an estimated market value of $10.2 billion earlier this year.

He planned to take four other cryptocurrency business leaders with him in an effort to convince Buffett, who once described bitcoin as “rat poison squared,” of the digital assets’ merits.

AD

“Buffett’s understanding of bitcoin is stuck in 2009. Now it’s 2019,” Sun told the Global Times, a nationalist tabloid with close ties to the Communist Party of China, in June, shortly after winning the auction. “My initial objective is to convince Buffett on the bitcoin and blockchain industry instead of creating hype.”

AD

Sun invited another skeptic to join the lunch. President Trump tweeted earlier this month that he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

Sun retorted that Trump had been misled. “#Bitcoin & #Blockchain happens to be the best chance for US!” he wrote. “I’d love to invite you to have lunch with crypto leaders along with @WarrenBuffett on July 25. I guarantee you after this lunch, nobody will know crypto more than you!”

But on Monday, just days before the scheduled meal and barely a week before his 29th birthday, Sun announced he was suffering from kidney stones and would have to postpone the meal. Tron, which then had a market capitalization of $2.8 billion, immediately lost more than 20 percent of its value.

Buffett had agreed to reschedule, Sun’s Tron Foundation tweeted. Glide confirmed that it had received the money and that the contribution was “already transforming lives.”

Sun’s announcement lit up Chinese social media, sparking speculation that he was variously under arrest or banned from leaving the country or otherwise in deep trouble with Chinese authorities.

Adding fuel to the fire, the government-owned 21st Century Business Herald, China’s biggest financial newspaper, reported Tuesday that Sun was in trouble for illegal fundraising through Tron. It said the Tron network had been facilitating illegal gambling services, adding that authorities suspected Sun’s earlier blockchain-based social-networking app PeiWo (literally “be my company”) had been involved in the pornography business.

PeiWo has been taken offline. Weibo and WeChat users say that the app was full of pornographic content and advertisements for paid sex services but that Sun’s company did nothing about it until his plan to have lunch with Buffett was announced.

AD

Then Caixin, a respected business magazine, reported that China’s financial technology regulator had called for a police investigation and that Sun had been barred from leaving China.

Sun and his representatives denied the reports. The entrepreneur took to Weibo to dismiss the Caixin story as a “totally tall tale” and to post photos of himself in San Francisco — showing he had not been banned from leaving China. He later deleted the photos.

In a live stream on Periscope, Sun showed he was working in an apartment with a view of the Bay Bridge, confirming that he was in San Francisco.

“Everything is okay,” he said Wednesday, showing viewers around the apartment and introducing members of his team. “I’m not feeling quite well, but I think we’re going to postpone but definitely looking forward to it.

AD

“I feel so much better now! It seems I will be back to work with full speed on this Friday!” Sun tweeted in English on Wednesday afternoon San Francisco time.

But in his open letter in Chinese on Weibo later that day, Sun ate humble pie.

“I will take a hiatus to recover, post less on Weibo, receive no more visitors, and do fewer press interviews so that I can quit the habit of excessive self-promotion,” he wrote. He promised to return to developing blockchain technology and “set a better example for our younger generations!”

AD

Sun started out as a tech golden boy. He graduated with a history degree from China’s prestigious Peking University and completed a master’s degree in political economy at the University of Pennsylvania in 2013, according to his LinkedIn page.

In 2014, the World Economic Forum named him a “Global Shaper.” The following year, Forbes included him in its “30 under 30” list, describing PeiWo as “an app aspiring to become China’s Snapchat that matches and connects users by analyzing 10-second voice samples as well [as] interests.”

He brags about being the first millennial graduate of the tech academy started by Jack Ma, founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Only leaders of start-ups with revenue of more than $4.5 million a year and at least 30 employees can enter the academy, called Hupan University. They must prove they have paid taxes for more than three years.

In 2017, Sun created the Tron blockchain protocol.

But he has become an increasingly controversial figure, accused of market manipulation and other financial irregularities.

Sun’s company was listed in June as an “enterprise with abnormal operations,” after industry and commerce officials in Guangdong province tried but failed to contact the registered company address, as displayed on the Chinese company credit record search engine Qichacha.com.

He Tao, deputy editor of GQ China, who wrote a profile of Sun in 2015, compared him to Elizabeth Holmes and her blood-testing start-up Theranos. Holmes disbanded her company amid allegations that it defrauded investors, patients and doctors; she and her chief operating officer are due to face trial next summer.

Revisiting Mises' Regression Theorem

Over 100 years after the publication of Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises’ “The Theory of Money and Credit,” the ideas outlined therein are still sparking hot debate. Namely, what is known as Mises’ Regression Theorem, which claims that in order for something to be money in the most proper sense, it must be traceable to an originally non-monetary barter commodity such as gold. Further, money must be the most commonly used means of exchange. According to these criteria, some say bitcoin isn’t the real deal. Others contend it makes the grade. Still others say it doesn’t matter, as regardless of what theorists, state regulators, or anyone else might say, crypto is being valued by the market, right here, right now.

Money as an Expectation

These days, what is and isn’t “real money” is a conversation often obscured by politics, centralized regulation, and loud shouting matches between economists. After all, even the “leader of the free world” himself, Donald J. Trump recently stated: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

The ideas formalized by Mises about the origins and value of money are largely extensions of thought from Austrian School founder Carl Menger. Menger pioneered the development of the subjective theory of value, rejecting the idea that the amount of time and labor put into the creation of a good mechanically determines its market value. In a nutshell, Mises’ Regression Theorem (not labeled as such until his later works) states that although all value is indeed subjective, there is an objective exchange-value, or price (the result of the current market’s subjective valuations), which determines a money or currency’s usefulness at a given time.

In “The Theory of Money and Credit” he states:

“The money prices of to-day are linked with those of yesterday and before, and with those of to-morrow and after.”

In other words, the value of money today is a product of its exchange value yesterday, and an expectation of its potential future value. What money could be exchanged for by the holder in times past, influences what it can be exchanged for today, and the price of money today affects its value and perceived future utility, as well.

If everyone knew the U.S. dollar was going to crash tomorrow, for example, its market value would plummet, as individual market actors dropped it feverishly for more stable stores of value and means of exchange. This shows that not only is money’s price ultimately subjective, but that it is also intrinsically linked to those expected price relationships of the future, and the confidence carrying over from the prices of the past.

Can Anything Be Money?

If the current objective exchange-value of modern money is traced back to its origin as a barter commodity, gold is usually recognized as the source. According to Mises, the moment gold began to be valued not only as a metal for jewelry, engineering, and decoration, but also as a dominant, useful means of exchange, it became money. In this way, current money has its roots in non-monetary commodity value by way of gold. Money, in this sense, and properly understood, isn’t just created “out of thin air.”

But wait a second. If basically any good’s exchange price can be traced back to gold, that seems to imply that absolutely anything could become money. Hostess cupcakes are delicious, and they have an exchange value relationship with dollars, which are ostensibly connected to gold’s value via the Regression Theorem. As such, if a given market began using cupcakes as a medium of exchange more popular than dollars, and called them money, would it make them so?

A Second Requirement

Both Menger and Mises define money as the medium of exchange most commonly used in a market. Markets tend to spiral upward for some goods, such as gold, as their exchange value becomes universalized. This makes sense, as the more various goods one can use gold to procure, the more useful gold becomes as a medium of exchange compared to, and at the expense of, other media like silver, salt, wheat, cowry shells, etc.

Thus money in its most basic terms is the most saleable, or marketable, means of exchange in a market, traceable to an original barter commodity. This means there can ultimately be only one global money in the final scenario of free market exchange, as markets naturally merge, and as trade naturally becomes as liquid as possible to the benefit of market actors. In other words, money is defined by the Austrian School finally as the thing that all goods can be traded for. It’s hard to realistically imagine Hostess cupcakes fulfilling this role.

What About Bitcoin?

Some argue bitcoin can’t be linked to gold like fiat can. It’s critical to remember though, that both Mises and Menger were strongly opposed to inflationary, violence-backed currencies like the U.S. dollar. Mises urged a return to the gold standard. Though the USD has an exchange price today argued to be resultant of objective exchange-value confidence in gold many years ago, abandonment of the gold standard and the violent enforcement of adoption has rendered this connection (aside from inherited price perception) tenuous at best. Still, bitcoin has no such perceived time-honored legacy, regardless.

It emerged seemingly out of nowhere, and in a sense, out of nothing. A kind of economic big bang phenomenon. However, like gold, bitcoin can also be argued to have a non-monetary, original commodity exchange value. According to libertarian economist Jeffrey Tucker:

The innovation here, even according to the words of its inventor, is the payment network, not the coin. The coin or digital unit only expresses the value of the network. It is an accounting tool that absorbs and carries the value of the network through time and space.

The question that remains is whether the Bitcoin blockchain and payment network can become the most common medium of exchange as compared to other media, and become money in the true Misesian and Mengerian sense. Gold can be easily seen to have become more popular in and of itself as a medium of exchange than as a barter commodity. Bitcoin, however, in the unique position of being inextricably both the means and the commodity could never satisfy this prerequisite. These are after all, in some sense, one and the same thing.

A Messy Economic Debate

If the whole thing seems rather convoluted and hairy, that’s because it is. Prior to the globalization brought about by technological innovation, could it be said that one medium of exchange was not “money” in its own microeconomy, just because another medium was more popular, thousands of miles away? This seems a bit of a stretch. Semantic, historic, geographic, and theoretical battles aside, perhaps what’s most important here is to just close the books for a second and step outside. Instead of heeding the bizarre recent proclamations of “authorities” like U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, it’s better to see what the market of real, human actors is actually doing now, in real time.

Currencies have traditionally been in competition with one another, vying for greater saleability in their respective markets to become money proper, in the strict Austrian sense. As such, the free market is ultimately the result of individuals valuing things and acting on these valuations through exchange. This is happening with bitcoin currently, and competition from other media, crypto or otherwise, is in no shortage.

Money, Here and Now

If tomorrow all the gold were somehow launched from the earth into outer space, economic life here would arguably be thrown into upheaval. That said, it wouldn’t be impossible, and new economies would emerge. As Mises himself says:

Nevertheless, if we trace to its deepest springs, first the subjective and then the objective exchange-value of commodities, we find that in the last resort it is still the subjective use-value of things that determines the esteem in which they are held.

Menger states that “Man himself is the beginning and the end of every economy.” As such, we’re at an interesting crossroads. It remains to be seen whether bitcoin or some other currency can or will overtake the violence-backed dollar. It’s also not certain whether the Bitcoin network would retain its commodity value in a USD market collapse scenario.

Regardless, what people use, they use. If gold replaced the most saleable market commodity at the time before it became money, another commodity could do the same to gold, tradition be damned. And as both Mises and Menger recognized the value of competing, localized currencies in pursuit of becoming the best means of exchange, it’s hard to see them standing opposed to bitcoin were they around today. Especially as they stood so staunchly opposed to the unsound economic practices of central banks and their fiat printing presses.

As reported by local business newspaper Dagens Naeringsliv (DN) on Tuesday, the new exchange is dubbed Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) and is slated to launch in August.

The magnate’s son, Lars Ola Kjos, is also said to have become a bitcoin investor, having bought NOK 3.5 million ($404,000) worth of the cryptocurrency in 2017. At the time, bitcoin prices were far below their current levels of $10,000.

DN said the investment came to light through documents from Lars’ company Green 91, and makes him one of Norway’s top crypto investors. He is also a board member of Norwegian Block Exchange, which the Kjos family owns almost outright, according to the report.

Once the exchange is up and running, the plan is to expand to neighboring countries and, in the autumn, provide a payment solution enabling Norwegian Air Shuttle customers to pay for tickets with cryptocurrency, DN says.

Norwegian Air Shuttle (Norwegian) is Scandinavia’s largest airline and Europe’s third-largest budget airline, according to Wikipedia.

According to an announcement by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unsealed a filing with the allegations on July 25. The defendant, Volantis principal Jon Barry Thompson, was also arrested on the same day.

Thompson allegedly made false representations about Volantis’ purported Bitcoin transaction service in order to fraudulently secure over $7 million from two different companies. In the filing, the complainants say that Thompson offered a service for low-risk crypto settlements by acting as a mutual custodian for two transacting parties.

Defendant allegedly used firm as a front for theft

However, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claims that Thompson used this service as a front to steal the “custodied” money:

“Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

The FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William F. Sweeney Jr., further specified that he believes Thompson used confusing jargon to exploit companies less familiar with the crypto space:

“Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn't understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency. Our job at the FBI is to investigate fraud and follow the money wherever it leads.”

The filing itself was signed on July 18, and contains the specifics of the fraud charges. According to the filing, the defendant is being charged with two counts of commodities fraud as well as two counts of wire fraud.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DoJ indicted an individual on July 24 for failing to register himself or his company with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The defendant, William Green, allegedly ran a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service on “Destination Bitcoin” out of New Jersey without registering as a money transmission business.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-installs-crypto-otc-guru-as-ceo-of-bitcoin-futures-platform,"United States cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has hired the ex-managing director of over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform B2C2 to head of development at its new Bitcoin futures operation.

Kevin Beardsley, who previously led the United Kingdom-based company for a year, will now oversee Kraken Futures’ expansion as volumes hit $2.5 billion in June.

Beardsley confirmed the news linking to comments he made to cryptocurrency news outlet The Block.

“Being a pretty wide range of different types of participants, I have a pretty good understanding of what people are looking for and how to meet those needs,” he said.

Kraken acquired its futures operation earlier this year. Formerly known as Crypto Facilities, the operation is still based in London.

Going forward, the exchange, which raised $13 million in funding last month, will compete with an increasing variety of futures options for cryptocurrency, several of which are surfacing from other trading platforms such as Binance and Huobi.

2019 is set to see multiple launches, with Bakkt, the institutional-grade crypto trading ecosystem, beginning testing of its futures product this week.

Erik Finman, the famous kid who became one of the first teenaged crypto millionaires, briefed congressional representatives on Bitcoin yesterday – or so he says. He even posted a picture with a lectern and a US flag.



Is This For Real?

So, Finman hasn’t seen his name in the media for a month or so, which is odd for the media attention loving crypto millionaire. He needed a sure-fire plan to prove his enduring relevance, once and for all. Never again will the cruel denizens of the press mock his rehashed version of an app idea from 2015, or his proclamation that ‘2019 is the new 2017‘, despite claiming that Bitcoin was dead just six short months earlier.

Hang on… Everyone and their mum is briefing congress about cryptocurrency at the moment, what with Libra and all that. Why can’t Finman do that too?

Today I briefed Congressional Representatives and staffers on Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and what it means for America. There is amazing energy in Washington, and people are ready to talk about crypto and find solutions for all Americans. Today was a good day for cryptocurrency! pic.twitter.com/wYz13oI0gb — ERIK FINMAN (@erikfinman) July 24, 2019

Let’s see if we can’t debunk Erik Finman’s alleged trip to Washington.

A tour of the capitol building is free first off, so even if Finman did go to Washington, it’s not like he needed to be a special guest to enter the building. Secondly, there is no sign of congressional representatives in the camera shot, which is very convenient. And finally, there is no actual proof that this picture was even taken in Washington – all we can see is just a handful of props and a blank wall.

Need More Proof? Let’s Sprinkle On The Cheese!

But just in case there might be someone who doubts the legitimacy of a single picture without any context, audience, microphone, or placard… Erik Finman needs a Trump card (pun very much intended). Something to put his claimed ‘briefing’ beyond question.

What about a video interview, fresh from the briefing room, with a sympathetic media channel?

In steps Cheddar, which is either woefully naive, wilfully ignorant, or paid off. Either way, it publishes a four and a half minute video of Finman standing outside a room. The room has a plaque, a security guard, and what looks like a tour group of schoolchildren coming out of it.

In the video, Erik Finman claims he has addressed congressmen, staffers, legislators, and policy-makers on Bitcoin. Some of them, supposedly, for the very first time. Although why they missed to mention the previous congressional hearings is anybody’s guess? The session was reportedly co-hosted by republican congressman, Paul Gosar.

During the interview, Finman is questioned on several of the aspects and events currently gripping the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency scene. In response, he delivers the kind of platitudes that illustrate just what a poor choice of speaker he would be… if this was not just all in his head.

Erik Finman has no special insight into Bitcoin and the crypto-industry. He got lucky by discovering it and buying in early.

He is now spending some of his early gains in an attempt to stay relevant. He is not.

The Internal Revenue Service is in the process of sending letters to U.S. citizens who own virtual currency and potentially failed to pay the necessary taxes and to those who improperly reported taxes on digital assets last year, the agency announced Friday.

""Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest and penalties,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a news release. ""The IRS is expanding our efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics.""

The agency said it started sending out letters last week that by the end of August will reach 10,000 taxpayers. The list of names was obtained through ""various ongoing IRS compliance efforts."" In some cases, the IRS said taxpayers could be subject to criminal prosecution.

Last year, popular trading platform Coinbase alerted 13,000 customers that it was complying with a court order to provide the IRS with information on accounts worth at least $20,000 from the years 2013 to 2015. The IRS did not say whether its mailing list was a result of the Coinbase disclosures.

Based on guidance issued in 2014, the IRS treats all virtual currencies — including bitcoin, ethereum and XRP — as property under U.S. tax law. That means that like real estate, the sale or exchange of tokens for other goods is a taxable event. And similar to stockholders, digital currency holders are required to report capital gains and losses from cryptocurrency trades.

Most trades count as short-term capital gains, which can be taxed at as high as 39% depending on income bracket. Those who hold bitcoin for more than a year and then sell it, however, are only liable for a long-term capital gains tax, which is levied at a significantly lower rate of 15% to 23.8%.

Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, is one of the relatively few lawmakers pushing for blockchain legislation that includes changes in the tax code. He and his co-sponsors introduced a bill earlier this year to exempt cryptocurrencies from federal securities laws that apply to traditional equities. The cryptocurrency tax issue has gained more attention recently in light of Facebook's proposed digital currency Libra.",2019-07-26,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/own-bitcoin-irs-pursues-cryptocurrency-owners-for-unpaid-taxes/,"The IRS is sending out 10,000 form letters to Americans who had cryptocurrency trades and may not have paid taxes.

The government has said that virtual currencies are taxed like property, but has not given more detailed guidance, to the frustration of many.

While the letters are essentially a generic reminder of tax obligations, they are a warning that a crackdown could be coming, tax attorneys said.



The IRS is going after taxpayers who owe money from cryptocurrency trades. The agency began sending letters last week telling people they ""potentially failed to report income"" from selling virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum, and will send 10,000 of these letters by the end of August, according to a press release.

Tax attorneys suggested that this campaign is an outgrowth of a court order last year for currency platform Coinbase to turn over information on about 13,000 accounts to the IRS. When most people in the U.S. buy cryptocurrencies, they use regulated exchanges like Coinbase, said Katya Fisher, practice group leader of the blockchain, digital assets and technology transactions practice at law firm Greenspoon Marder.

The IRS letters, which appear to be generic, are ""basically a nice reminder,"" Fisher said—not an indication that an audit is imminent. But they do mean taxpayers need to make sure they've paid taxes on any cryptocurrency they may have sold in the last few years.

Virtual currency is taxed like property, according to IRS guidance issued in 2014. This means that if someone sold a cryptocurrency after it grew in value, they would have to pay a capital gains tax of between 10% and 37% on the profits, depending on how long they held the asset. Conversely, if someone lost money in the crypto markets, they could use the losses to offset other income during the year.

Taxes only apply once the currency is sold—so if someone's virtual wallet has swelled with gains, they don't automatically have to pay tax on its higher values until those currencies are exchanged for dollars.

Um, how to account for Bitcoin's 70 cryptocurrency splits?

While the government has made clear it expects a slice of any virtual currency gains, it's lagged in providing specifics, such as how to treat paying taxes on a cryptocurrency that splits—as Bitcoin has done about 70 times in its existence.

""Where it gets challenging is if you or somebody is day-trading and buying in and out; there's a host of issues relating to what part of bitcoin did you sell, how long did you hold it, what is the method for determining what's going in or out?"" said attorney Nelson Yates at law firm Morgan Lewis.

""The one thing taxpayers have in their corner is the lack of guidance,"" he added. ""Now, if you just didn't report [gains], that's where you'll find yourself in trouble.""

It's hard to know how many crypto owners might owe taxes. One survey this year from LendEDU suggested that 7% of respondents had dabbled in cryptocurrency.

When the IRS went to court to get Coinbase records, it asked for accounts that sold or bought more than $20,000 worth of virtual currency between 2013 and 2015. There were more than 14,000 accounts fitting this description, while the IRS said it only received 800 to 900 reports of crypto-related gains or losses during that time.

""My guess is that 99% of people in crypto are ignorant, to some extent, of these issues,"" Fisher said. ""I don't blame them—these issues are very complicated, and we don't expect them to be tax experts.""

Wanted"" ""The Leona Helmsley of cryptocurrency""

The good news is that taxpayers can have a fairly long period of time to file an amended return—three and a half years after a first return is filed.

""Until an audit is underway, you can try to file an amended return. For a lot of taxpayers that may be the way to go, especially if you file your returns yourself,"" Yates said.

However, the letter is an indication that harsher tactics could be around the corner, especially coming on the heels of vocal White House pessimism about virtual currency. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has called Facebook's development of a currency ""a national security issue"" and promised that regulations would be forthcoming. President Donald Trump has said he's ""not a fan.""

""I think they're looking for the Leona Helmsley of cryptocurrency,"" said Greenspoon Marder's James Mann, referring to the real estate widow who famously said ""only the little people pay taxes"" years before she was convicted of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes.

""This is a prelude to an effort to find some really bad actors and make a lesson out of them,"" Mann said.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/safeway-shoppers-can-now-get-bitcoin-back-as-change-at-894-us-stores,"Bitcoin (BTC) rewards shopping app Lolli has partnered with major American grocery chain Safeway to give customers 3.5% back in Bitcoin on all their purchases.

Making Bitcoin ‘part of everyday life’

According to a blog post announcing the new partnership on July 25, Safeway – and Albertsons Companies’ subsidiary – operates 894 locations across 17 American states.

The system will reward customers in Satoshis (sats) — the name given to one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin — the smallest unit of the cryptocurrency.

In an interview with Yahoo! Finance, Lolli CEO & co-founder Alex Adelman said that teaming up with “one of the most well-recognized food retailers in the United States [...] will give people the ability to get involved in holding and owning Bitcoin — perhaps for the first time.”

He added that whereas the initial thought during Bitcoin’s early days had been that the cryptocurrency would first be used as a payments rail, his view is that earning Bitcoin will be the “first wave that gets Bitcoin in the hands of the masses.”

As compared with retailers’ traditional fiat currency-denominated loyalty cards, he argued that cryptocurrency was a better store of value, likening it to a savings account that could reap lucrative rewards to long-term holders:

“Points, as you know, are deflationary, and Bitcoin is non-deflationary, so I think it’s a better store of value than an arbitrary points system.”

Crypto adds value to loyalty systems

Brought on behalf of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the action paints a story of a firm’s blatant disregard for the law. The government alleges BTC-e and Vinnik were more than willing to launder and hold funds for some of the most nefarious organizations involved in the cryptocurrency industry, so long as its owners profited.

This includes funds received from the computer ‘hack’ that brought down prominent exchange Mt. Gox.

Unlike many legitimate crypto exchanges, the Cyprus and Seychelles-based BTC-e billed itself as an anonymous way to buy, sell, and transact in bitcoin and other digital currencies. Anyone, anywhere was allowed to operate on its platform without “even the most basic identifying information.”

Attorneys David Anderson, Sara Winslow, and Kirsten Ault allege this willfully substandard record keeping “contributed to its customers’ willingness to accept BTC-e’s unfavorable exchange rates compared to other legitimate” exchanges.

Over its 6 year history, BTC-e served approximately 700,000 users who traded over $296 million over more than 21,000 bitcoin transactions, not to mention the other coins. While not all of BTC-e’s clients were criminals, the investigators write:

“A significant portion of BTC-e’s business was derived from suspected criminal activity.”

Indeed, the firm’s lax approach to collecting user information, hosting of unmonitored open forums where users discussed ways to purchase illicit goods, and refusal to implicate the known criminals on its platform had attracted some of the industry’s worst players, and eventually the government’s attention.

Cultivated crime

The firm allegedly cultivated its identity as a safe-haven for the criminal element.

In its chatroom, people “under monikers suggestive of criminality, including user names such as ‘ISIS,’ ‘CocaineCowboys,’ ‘blackhathackers,’ ‘dzkillerhacker,’ and ‘hacker4hire,’” would publicly discuss buying or accessing illicit materials on the dark-web.

Furthermore, the attorneys allege:

“On some occasions, customers contacted BTCe’s administration directly with questions regarding how to process and access proceeds obtained from the sale of illegal drugs and from transactions on known “darknet” illegal markets, including Silk Road.”

At no point did BTC-e ring the alarm, and money kept flowing in.

The attorneys singled out the business relationship forged between BTC-e and Costa Rica-based Liberty Reserve. Allegedly, the firms shared customers and even had a program were “BTC-e code” was redeemable for Liberty’s digital currency.

After Liberty Reserve was shuttered for laundering $6 billion in illicit funds – in an action where U.S. authorities seized the firm’s website and arrested its six principal operators – BTC-e failed to disclose the alliance and smuggled fund’s concealed on its platform.

That case was not an outlier. According to the attorneys, another unregistered and now-shuttered crypto exchange, Coin.MX, performed nearly 1,000 transactions on BTC-e’s platform. Coin.MX, too, was closed on money laundering and conspiracy charges following a Federal investigation. Yet, again, BTC-e failed to disclose this relationship in a Suspicious Activity Report mandated under the Bank Secrecy Act.

While all possible criminal connections cannot be listed here, according to the attorneys the firm harbored funds earned by malicious botnets, scams, and computer hijackings. They took money from identity thieves, and public officials who embezzled funds. And yet, “despite the rampant evidence of illegal activity on its platform, BTC-e did not file a single SAR.”

SAR silence

Instead of speaking out, BTC-e allegedly concealed this sort of illicit activity by instructing their clients to wire money to “front” companies, nominally distinct from the exchange. Furthermore, it is said, BTC-e never recorded or asked for identifying information when receiving wires.

BTC-e would further obscure and anonymize the funds by processing transactions through a layer of temporary addresses called a bitcoin “mixer,” a way to protect both sides of the deal.

What ultimately brought the firm down was its failure to register as a money transmitter.

In May 2016, a grand jury in California’s Northern District “returned a two-count indictment charging BTC-e and Vinnik with operation of an Unlicensed Money Services Business.”

Six months later, a grand jury pushed forward a twenty-one count superseding indictment against Vinnik and his firm. They alleged at no point had anti-money laundering policies set in place, “let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions.”

Among the suspicious transactions were those from operator Vinnik, who allegedly skimmed money from clients and used the platform as a personal bank.

While Vinnik has denied the charges against him, even denying he was an executive of the firm, the attorney’s office is attempting to prove he “operated several administrative, financial, operational, and support accounts at BTC-e.”

Vinnik, a Russian national arrested while vacationing in Greece in July 2017, has previously asked for extradition to Russia. He faces a maximum 55 years in prison.

US vs BTC-e/Vinnik by CoinDesk on Scribd",2019-07-26 22:30:44+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-bill-miller-hedge-fund-surges-46-thanks-to-bitcoin-amazon,"The hedge fund of famous investor Bill Miller saw 46% growth in the first half of 2019, reportedly in some part from investing in Bitcoin (BTC).

Citing an investor document, Bloomberg reports on July 26 that Miller achieved such outstanding results by investing in Bitcoin among other high-performing stocks. Alongside Bitcoin, other investments in the Miller’s fund reportedly include Amazon, security system firm ADT, as well as Avon Products.

The 69 year-old investor reportedly found success by following a similar investment strategy as he used during his three-decade run at Legg Mason, which envisions investing in securities that trade at a large discount to their intrinsic value.

According to Bloomberg, Miller’s fund has $126 million in assets, while Miller totally oversees $2.3 billion at his Baltimore-based firm. Additionally, the fund’s monthly performance has seen some volatility, having surged about 39% in June after dropping 29% the month before.

Bitcoin has no obvious correlation to traditional markets, says Miller

Earlier this year, Miller claimed that Bitcoin can potentially have a high value or be worth nothing, considering the biggest cryptocurrency a curious technological experiment. At the time, Miller said that he is not a Bitcoin believer, but rather an observer, adding that he included crypto in his portfolio because there is no obvious correlation between crypto markets and the stock market.

The Indian government official who headed the committee which drafted the bill to ban cryptocurrencies has applied for voluntary retirement after releasing the report and draft bill which the crypto community calls “flawed.” Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that cryptocurrency is currently not prohibited in the country and the recommendations are being examined by relevant authorities.

Crypto Recommendations Heavily Criticized

India’s cryptocurrency bill has been drafted by an interministerial committee headed by former Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg. The committee began working on crypto recommendations since November 2017 and finally submitted its report with a draft bill to the Ministry of Finance on July 22. After both the report and the bill were made public, Garg tweeted that his “Committee is very receptive and supportive of distributed ledger technologies [DLTs] … [but] Private cryptocurrencies are of no real value. Rightly banned.”

His tweet did not fare well among the Indian crypto community, as comments soon flooded his account in response. Some criticized his definition of private cryptocurrencies. “Sir, BTC is not private, it’s more transparent than your INR,” a comment reads. Others pointed out that crypto is the future in advanced countries and banning it would cost India jobs, investments, talent, and more.

The community was also quick to point out that cryptocurrency is not banned in India despite Garg’s tone which could be misconstrued otherwise. A number of people contested the committee’s finding that “There is no underlying intrinsic value of these private cryptocurrencies,” with some arguing that embracing DLT while banning cryptocurrency is ludicrous. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on the content of this bill including crypto-related prohibitions and offenses.

Garg Unexpectedly Quits

On July 24, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reshuffled his top-level bureaucrats and appointed Department of Investments and Public Asset Management Secretary Atanu Chakraborty as the new DEA Secretary. Garg has been appointed Secretary of Ministry of Power, primarily responsible for the development of electrical infrastructure across the country. According to local media, he is unhappy with the shift and has subsequently applied for voluntary retirement. He made a final tweet from his DEA Secretary Twitter account on July 25, confirming the story.

Garg’s exit has given Indians some hope as they see a possibility that the new DEA Secretary could take a more positive approach to cryptocurrency.

“Good riddance! for not understanding basic crypto uses and biased report written to [the] government. I hope the next person in office after you is educated enough,” one Twitter user commented. Many others shared this sentiment in their own comments. “With cryptos, you proved your inability to grasp new technology and its adoption,” another declared.

Some went as far as accusing Garg of ruining people’s livelihood and fleeing when the situation got out of control as people became upset. “You should be jailed or [an] investigation should be launched against you for the deterioration of the Indian economy,” according to one user. Another wrote:

[The] Entire crypto community in India is happy to know that you are quitting.

Nearly all the responses to Garg’s final tweet as the DEA Secretary are about crypto, with some people still asking him to change his mind about banning it before he leaves and ensuring its regulation.

Crypto Currently Not Banned in India

The Indian government has recently confirmed that cryptocurrency is currently not banned in India. Shri Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, told Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India’s parliament, on July 16 that the government has not prohibited cryptocurrency in the country.

According to the Ministry of Finance:

This [Garg’s committee] report and draft bill will now be examined in consultation with all the concerned departments and regulatory authorities before the government takes a final decision.

“After this, if the government decides to go ahead with the ban, this bill will be presented in parliament for debate, and vote. If it’s approved by the majority, it will be sent to the President for his approval as per Article 111,” explained Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx. “Only after his assent, can a bill become an Act of Parliament.” He further cited one of the recommendations in the report, stating that “It is also possible that the government may establish a standing committee to revisit the issues addressed in the report as and when required.”

Bill and Report Dated Feb. 28

Even though the interministerial committee report (IMC) was made public on July 22, it is dated Feb. 28, which some criticize as being too outdated given recent major developments such as the G20 summit and the release of new crypto standards by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF guidance was released on June 21. India, along with other G20 nations, has reaffirmed its commitment to applying these standards.

Sumit Gupta, CEO of local exchange Coindcx, shared his thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com, stating that “The report cracks fundamentally at places, there were few flaws pointed out in its understanding of DLT/cryptocurrencies and seems dated (5 months old).”

The Indian supreme court is expected to address the IMC report in the upcoming hearing of writ petitions against the banking restriction by the central bank. Gupta believes that “This document, which is framed prior to India’s commitment to FATF recommendations, shouldn’t be set as the benchmark for the supreme court hearing,” adding that “Hopefully, the court asks the DEA to review it again and make a fresh recommendation in view of the major global developments since then.”

Shetty further asserted:

The report has completely ignored the FATF guidelines which clearly states that crypto is not a threat to the global economy, and can be regulated properly.

Flawed Crypto Report

The Wazirx CEO believes that “everything” is wrong with the committee’s report. “It’s unfair to allow a committee made up of non-technologists to make a decision on an innovative technology still in the nascent stage. It’s shocking to think that people from the industry were never consulted before preparing the report,” he opined.

Even the classification of cryptocurrency is flawed, he detailed, adding that the committee recommends a ban on the use of crypto as legal tender or currency without mentioning other possible classifications such as asset, utility, or securities. “It shows that they don’t have enough understanding of crypto,” he remarked.

Before publishing the report, the committee claims to have studied how a number of countries treat cryptocurrency. However, Shetty pointed out some inaccuracies. For example, “The report also incorrectly mentions that crypto is banned in China, but in reality, holding crypto is not banned,” he clarified, noting that “recently, bitcoin was legally recognized by a Chinese court, whereby it was concluded that it should now be considered as digital property.” The CEO continued:

I hope that the Indian government will keep an open mind, and not take such a regressive decision that will push us decades behind. IMC’s report is flawed, and lacks a fundamental understanding of cryptocurrencies.

“The report exhibits that there was no clear consensus in the committee on banning. Interestingly, the committee also understands that considering the nature of technology, banning might not be effective,” Gupta further shared with news.Bitcoin.com. “As DLT is a fast-evolving technology, it’s recommended that a standing committee should discuss some of these points openly and more frequently with industry experts outside the government and come up with the right ways to regulate the industry effectively rather than outrightly banning it. The solution is to educate, regulate and allowing people to innovate.”

Meanwhile, there are several ways the community can help the Indian government understand crypto. News.Bitcoin.com previously reported on some ideas for the community to help. Shetty urges all Indians to “Write physical letters to your local MPs, our finance minister, and prime minister explaining why this IMC report is flawed.”

The crypto whiz kid who bailed on a $4.6 million lunch with Warren Buffett has been accused of stiffing the founder of BitTorrent, a file-sharing service he acquired for a reported $126 million last summer.

Justin Sun, now CEO of BitTorrent and the Tron cryptocurrency platform, postponed the charity meal with Berkshire Hathaway's billionaire chairman scheduled for Thursday, blaming a bout of kidney stones. However, he rallied to attend the Tron Influencer Party and celebrate the one-year anniversary of the BitTorrent deal. Bram Cohen, BitTorrent's creator and CEO of bitcoin-rival Chia, clearly wasn't pleased.

""Anybody know if Justin Sun is hard up for cash?"" Cohen tweeted. ""He isn't letting the last payment for BitTorrent get out of escrow.""

Sun retweeted a reply from Tron's head of business development, Ron Liu, saying that the funds in escrow are ""not considered Justin's cash"" and Sun had signed the release agreement. Cohen countered by asking why the release wasn't signed two months ago as scheduled, and suggested Tron was trying to reclaim the funds. Tron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

""I don't have the fucking money and the escrow agency says they haven't gotten signoff,"" Cohen told another user.

Cohen's claims come after Caixin reported Sun delayed his lunch with Buffett because he was being held by the Chinese government over a laundry list of allegations including illegal fundraising, money laundering, and gambling. Sun denied the claims and broadcast a live video showing he was in San Francisco.

However, several Tron executives were briefly detained by Chinese authorities then released after Sun delayed the lunch, according to Bloomberg. Sun also took to Chinese social-media website Weibo to apologize for his ""big mouth"" and efforts to hype the Buffett lunch, revealed he was being scrutinized by regulators, and pledged to put his country first and retreat from the public eye.

Partying with influencers and fending off accusations on Twitter has done little to lower Sun's profile so far.

Curtin University Accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum

The Cryptocurrency PhD Scholarship Fund will allow companies and individuals to help PhD students studying blockchain, cybersecurity and data analytics through cryptocurrency funding.

Focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, the higher education program will be entirely funded through bitcoin or ethereum, which school officials say will help popularize cryptocurrencies as a payment method.

Curtin University Associate Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research Excellence Professor Garry Allison notes the fund is a good opportunity for cryptocurrency investors to foster a new generation of PhD graduates who will help develop this new technology.

“By establishing the Cryptocurrency PhD Scholarship Fund, Curtin will provide the opportunity for entrepreneurs who have realised significant benefits from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to give something back to these communities,” said Professor Allison.

The new fund means that wealthy crypto investors can help facilitate the adoption of Bitcoin and blockchain technology by helping fund the education of interested students. Moreover, the most generous donors can even choose the field of speciality they are willing to sponsor.

Universities around the world are catching on

In the last few months, other educational institutions like Dublin City University and University of British Columbia have launched blockchain technology programs.

Crypto assets have come a long way since Bitcoin. What started out as a P2P payment system has spawned an array of use cases that extend far beyond the original designation of cryptocurrency. While the primary function of crypto assets such as ETH and BTC is a matter of some debate, what’s indisputable is that digital currencies can now be used for more than merely paying for goods and services. Here are five use cases for crypto assets that demonstrate the extent of the fintech revolution taking place.

Use Case 1: Digital Cash

Conceived as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, if the title of Satoshi’s whitepaper is to be taken at face value, Bitcoin lived up to its billing for the first five years. Before the mainstream came to terms with Bitcoin, it fueled a nascent digital economy that included black market goods (Silk Road) and gambling (Satoshi Dice). It was also accepted by hundreds of tech-savvy merchants and early adopters, for purchasing everything from graphics cards to t-shirts.

As network fees began to rise, forcing numerous merchants to drop support for BTC, a growing cult of Bitcoin Core loyalists, who would come to be known as maximalists, started advocating a store of value (SoV) narrative over that of a medium of exchange (MoE). With BTC becoming unsuitable for low cost payments, the P2P torch passed to Bitcoin Cash, which sprung to life in mid-2017 as a fork of Bitcoin. The BCH network has since maintained its community’s goal of facilitating fast and low-cost payments, with thousands of merchants accepting bitcoin cash in store and online.

Meanwhile, during the 2017 ICO boom, scores of crypto projects sprung up with generic payment tokens attached to them as the justification for raising funds. When the tide went out on the crypto market in early 2018, it became evident that native ERC20 payment tokens simply weren’t feasible, with most dying a slow death due to high velocity and low liquidity. The crypto assets that survive today as P2P currencies are largely limited to pre-2015 coins such as dash and litecoin.

Use Case 2: Programmable Money

Smart contracts actually predate Bitcoin, having been conceived by Nick Szabo (who is himself credited with being one of the likelier candidates to be Satoshi Nakamoto). Smart contracts are simply blockchain-based executable code that actions a particular outcome provided certain conditions have been met. Although synonymous with Ethereum, most crypto networks have a degree of smart contract functionality, including Bitcoin itself.

RSK has devised a smart contracting platform that capitalizes on the security of the Bitcoin blockchain and its network effects. As BTC’s dominance over altcoins has grown this year, so has the appeal of building on Bitcoin ahead of less decentralized alternatives such as Tron and EOS. As a result, developers that might have previously flocked to so-called “second-gen” blockchains, have had cause to look at Bitcoin in a whole new light. As for the Bitcoin Cash network, Simple Ledger Protocol has facilitated the issuance of sub-tokens, created using opcodes that Satoshi originally incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol.

Use Case 3: Collateral

Lending has become one of the most important applications of the burgeoning decentralized finance (defi) movement, enabling individuals to collateralize fiat loans against cryptocurrency and vice-versa. On the Ethereum network, lending services such as Maker, Compound, and Instadapp have flourished, with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of assets now locked up in lending protocols. Other defi lending solutions include Dharma and Dydx, while centralized alternatives include Salt, Youhodler, and Nexo, which allow people to obtain a fiat loan in exchange for locking up their crypto. There’s also the option for hodlers to earn annualized interest by locking their cryptocurrency into these lending protocols.

Use Case 4: Governance

Governance might not sound like the most exciting of use cases for cryptocurrency, but on-chain voting is a very effective means of ensuring provable voter turnout. Bitcoin miners have long engaged in primitive governance by signalling support for protocol changes by signing new blocks; in June 2017 for instance, 80% of the BTC network’s hashrate was adding the letters “NYA” to blocks in support of the New York Agreement (which ultimately failed).

Aragon Network Vote #3 is now over! The results have been locked in using the Aragon Governance Voting apps:https://t.co/b3JJ2FDz6C Here is a thread with the results from the vote: — Aragon (@AragonProject) July 27, 2019

Blockchain governance has gotten more sophisticated since then, with Dash, introducing a successful budget voting mechanism that’s been emulated by scores of projects. There are now crypto assets whose primary function includes governance, such as 0x, maker, decred and dfinity. In addition, crypto projects such as Aragon incorporate governance through enabling token-holders to vote on key decisions using a dapp. So far, participation in on-chain governance has been low for crypto projects, showing that voter apathy is a universal problem.

Use Case 5: Collectibles

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represent unique digital assets. These typically comprise in-game collectibles such as skins or characters, or in virtual reality games can represent digital land or property. This makes it possible to trade the assets to fellow collectors or players, and ensures full ownership of the collectible. That’s not to say that NFTs are fully decentralized, however, as their value still depends on a central authority, say Cryptokitties or Cheeze Wizards, which hosts the image associated with each token and controls the virtual world it operates in. Nevertheless, collectibles represent a growing vertical within the cryptosphere, with NFTs likely to become deeply embedded into esports and virtual reality in the years to come.

Evolving Applications for Crypto Assets

Cryptocurrencies are still young, and thus many of the envisioned use cases for them have yet to fully materialize, often because the infrastructure is still being built. Security tokens, hybrid tokens, derivatives, crypto commodities, privacy coins, stablecoins, work tokens, discount tokens and many more have still to establish themselves, but are likely to gain a foothold as crypto adoption increases and the ecosystem matures.

From national reserve currency to time-stamping documents, Bitcoin continues to prove its versatility. One of the best things about permissionless networks is that anyone can use them however they see fit, be it at the base layer or via secondary and tertiary layers. The crypto space has evolved in leaps and bounds over the past decade. 10 years from now, crypto assets will be serving functions that we have yet to envisage, let alone design.

What other use cases do you envisage for crypto assets in the future? Let us know in the comments section below.

The Internal Revenue Service has begun mailing more than 10,000 letters to cryptocurrency holders warning of stiff penalties if they fail to report income or pay tax on crypto transactions.

The service is sending out three variations of one letter, depending on the information it has on the recipient, reported the Wall Street Journal.

One version asks recipients to sign a statement declaring, under the penalty of perjury, that they are in compliance with tax rules that treat digital currencies like bitcoin as investment property akin to stocks or real estate.

“Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously. The IRS is expanding efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics,” said the IRS commissioner, Chuck Rettig.

The list of names appears to come from a database containing 13,000 accounts holders who have bought, sold, sent or received digital currency worth $20,000 or more between 2013 and 2015.

Coinbase, a digital currency exchange, handed the database over to the IRS in March 2018 under a federal court order. Although the IRS has declined to reveal if the recipients stem from information obtained from Coinbase, the service has previously indicated its belief that few cryptocurrency investors appear to be paying taxes due on sales.

Tax lawyers have told clients that threats to bust cryptocurrency holders for tax evasion should be taken seriously. Since 2009, more than 56,000 Americans who hid money in offshore accounts have paid more than $11bn to resolve tax issues.

William Perez, a tax accountant at the online tax filing and advisory service Visor, told the Guardian last year he had noticed that accountants are often unwilling to familiarize themselves with crypto-accounting rulings.

“Among crypto-investors, I see resistance to reporting it,” he says. “Then there’s another group who’ve got a 1099 [tax form] from Coinbase but they don’t know what it means.”

The IRS criminal investigations chief, Don Fort, has said the IRS plans to make public criminal tax-evasion cases involving cryptocurrency.

After a meeting of the international Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement (J5) in June, Fort warned that the J5 group had “found innovative ways to tackle these problems, remove barriers, and develop processes” to tackle crypto-crime.

“It is not a good time to be a tax criminal on the run. Your days are numbered,” Fort added.",2019-07-27,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-moves-closer-to-accepting-blockchain-still-uncertain-over-crypto,"Despite concerns expressed by many United States regulators during the recent House Committee on Financial Services’ hearing on Facebook’s proposed digital currency, Libra, an increasing number of U.S. lawmakers are speaking out in favor of developing a permissive regulatory apparatus to prevent stifling innovation in the cryptocurrency sector.

Several days prior to the hearing, the passing of the Blockchain Promotion Act signposted the government’s intention to develop a prudent legislative framework to oversee possible implementation of blockchain technology in various public sectors. Skepticism pertaining to the operation of Facebook and its stablecoin project aside, the month’s regulatory proceeding indicated that lawmakers may be moving closer to embracing digital assets — and especially the technology behind them — at least from a regulatory point of view.

Bitcoin is an “unstoppable force”

Rep. Patrick McHenry, who represents North Carolina’s 10th Congressional District and is a ranking member of the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, described Bitcoin as comprising an “unstoppable force” while delivering a testimony as part of the committee’s recent hearing.

McHenry implored regulators to encourage innovation within the United States’ digital currency sector, stating:

“The world that Satoshi Nakamoto — author of the Bitcoin white paper — envisioned, and others are building, is an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this innovation, and governments cannot stop this innovation, and those who have tried have already failed. So the question then becomes, what are American policymakers going to do to meet the challenges and the opportunities of this new world of innovation?”

McHenry asserted that the desire to tightly regulate cryptocurrency is symptomatic of policymakers who wish to stifle innovation, stating, “Some politicians want us to live in a permission-based society, where you need to come to government, ask for its blessing before you can begin to even think about innovating.”

On the same day, McHenry was interviewed on CNBC's “Squawk Box” to discuss the hearing on Facebook’s proposed digital currency at Capitol Hill, in which he described a “knee-jerk reaction to kill it [Libra] before it grows” that many U.S. lawmakers might have. He argued:

“There’s a white paper that’s an idea. And there’s a consortium of companies — some with better reputations than Facebook currently has — that are developing a digital payments platform and a digital currency. Interesting, right? Instead, we have a knee-jerk reaction to kill an idea.”

McHenry emphasized the need to encourage and foster innovation given the context of the United States’ “stagnant economy,” saying, “If they can comply with existing laws, have at it.”

Cryptocurrency regulation comprises matter of “financial inclusion”

McHenry described “financial inclusion for those who are on the margins, where the transfer of money is exceedingly high” as the fundamental issue at stake when discussing the regulation of digital currency.

“So, you have an immigrant who, on Friday evenings, judiciously, every week, sends money back to his family where he grew up, wherever in the world. He’s paying Western Union 7% to 10% to move that money. Libra is a very different mover in that space to reduce the cost of those low-dollar remittances.”

McHenry also advanced distributed ledger technology as a potential solution to the challenges pertaining to the global movement of large sums of money, stating: “It’s exceedingly costly, and the SWIFT network that is being broadly used is a very expensive one, and an old technology.” So, there is huge opportunity for financial inclusion for low-dollar and extreme cost-savings potentially for high-dollar movements of cash.”

U.S. Senate committee approves “Blockchain Promotion Act”

On July 9, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the Blockchain Promotion Act. The bill, which was first introduced to the House of Representatives in October 2018 and then moved on to the Senate in February 2019, directs the Department of Commerce to establish a standard definition for “blockchain.” Rob Odell, vice president of product and marketing at crypto-backed loan provider Salt, told Cointelegraph that:

“By developing a taxonomy or set of agreed-upon terms and definitions for blockchain and crypto-related concepts, people can begin speaking about these concepts in a way that drives understanding and alignment among industry and governmental leaders. As blockchain achieves a global definition, regulatory bodies will be forced to acknowledge, discuss, and eventually understand what blockchains are already providing and what they have the potential to provide.”

The bill is intended to prevent the development of a patchwork regulatory definition pertinent to distributed ledger technology at the state level by establishing a fundamental framework for future legislation — and to recommend potential applications for the nascent technology. The bill has received bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House. Odell went on to say regarding this:

“The passing of the Blockchain Promotion Act by the Senate creates an opportunity to promote the technology at a federal level and expose more government organizations to how it can bring more transparency and efficiency to their work. What’s especially exciting about this bill is that it’s received bipartisan support-- a testament to the fact that members of both major political parties in the US are recognizing the value that blockchain technology can bring to the United States and to the rest of the world, whether it’s by preventing tax fraud, eliminating bureaucracy or reducing waste.""

In the Senate, the Blockchain Promotion Act is co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana. Markey described blockchain as “an exciting new technology with great potential and promise,” adding:

“At its core, blockchain is a tool for exchanging data in a secure and accountable fashion, and it has already been deployed to expand access to renewable energy, enhance health care delivery systems, and improve supply chain efficiency. This legislation will help further understand applications for this technology and explore opportunities for its use within the federal government. This is a commonsense step that will help position the United States and for success.”

Republican Sen. Todd Young emphasized the potential for distributed ledger technology to comprise a catalyst for sustained economic growth across all industries. He said:

“If America leads in its development, we can ensure that it’s benefits will be shared far and wide. Blockchain has the potential to not only provide financial and economic benefits at home, but humanitarian and social support in developing countries will benefit from American leadership.”

In the House, the bill is co-sponsored by a Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky’s 2nd Congressional District and Democrat Rep. Doris Matsui of California’s 6th Congressional District. Congressman Guthrie emphasized the need to eliminate “regulatory uncertainty” within the blockchain sector, stating:

“As our economies become increasingly digital, more organizations are turning to blockchain for business transactions and other new applications. Blockchain can be a great resource for innovation and technology, but as the technology develops we must reduce regulatory uncertainty by figuring out whether there is a common definition and how the technology can be used.”

Matsui expressed her assumption that the Blockchain Promotion Act will lay the groundwork for fostering innovation within the distributed ledger technology sector, stating:

“This bipartisan, bicameral bill will bring a broad group of stakeholders together to develop a common definition of blockchain, and, perhaps even more importantly, recommend opportunities to leverage the technology to promote new innovations.”

Blockchain Working Group to be established within U.S. Department of Commerce

Within 90 days of the enactment of the Blockchain Promotion Act, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, will be required to establish a working group within the Department of Commerce.

The group, called the Blockchain Working Group, will be partially comprised of members representing a “cross-section” of federal agencies that could benefit from the adoption of distributed ledger technology, and representatives from industry stakeholders, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and consumer advocacy groups engaged in activities relating to blockchain technology. Additionally, the Blockchain Working Group is required to include representatives from industry stakeholders specifically from sectors other than technology, as well as representation from both rural and urban stakeholders.

The working group is tasked with submitting a report to Congress within one year of the Blockchain Promotion Act’s enactment. The report will include a recommendation for a definition of “blockchain technology,” in addition to making recommendations on a study examining the range of potential applications for distributed ledger technology and suggesting possible applications for blockchain technology that will promote efficiency within U.S. federal agencies.

The group will also be tasked with recommending a study into the impact of blockchain on “electromagnetic spectrum policy,” which will be carried out by the assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission.

Lastly, the Blockchain Working Group is encouraged to consider any recommendations made within the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s “Blockchain Technology Report” from October 2018.",,https://www.coindesk.com/high-frequency-trading-and-colocation-in-the-digital-asset-space,"Matthew Trudeau is chief strategy officer at crypto asset exchange ErisX. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.

Recently CoinDesk published an article titled, ‘High Frequency Trading is Newest Battle Ground in Crypto Exchange Race’ that discusses trading venues offering direct connectivity to their matching engines.

While ErisX has only recently launched its spot market, other crypto exchanges announced their intention to and/or began to enable trading firms to cross-connect (a direct network connection within the data center as opposed to a connection routed over the internet) to their matching engines at least a year ago, so this is not a new development.

Cross-connects are a standard service in global capital markets, utilized across asset classes and market participant types, so the characterization of such connectivity options as “rolling out the red carpet for high frequency traders” is peculiar. Based on the article, none of the exchanges that responded, including ErisX, actually directly offer colocation services (colocation is provided by the datacenter owners/operators).

One of our core views at ErisX is that precision in discussing any important topic is critical, be it institutional interest, custody, etc. so in this piece we are applying the same rigor when discussing “high frequency trading,” “colocation” and “data center-hosted” exchanges vs. “cloud-based” exchanges.

Because ErisX is one of the exchanges mentioned in the article as trying to attract large algorithmic traders with “colocation” offers, we want to more precisely define “algorithmic trading” and “HFT.”

We also want to explain why automated trading can be beneficial to the market and address the distinction, missing in the CoinDesk article, between “cloud” versus “data center-hosted” exchanges and why exchanges hosted in data centers present superior performance and benefits to market participants.

Defining HFT

High frequency trading (HFT) has been a topic of debate in large part because of a lack of precision and/or understanding by commentators even in traditional markets. There are different kinds of “HFT” but for this post we will define it as automation of trading strategies enabled by computers to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second.

Leveraging algorithms, high frequency traders analyze market conditions to manage risk and execute orders based on predefined trading strategies. Blackrock, a global investment management company, did an excellent job of further distinguishing a taxonomy of HFT strategies along with their relative impact on market quality in a 2014 whitepaper US Equity Market Structure: An Investor Perspective.

We would add to the taxonomy in the graphic below a fifth category of fraudulent or manipulative strategies that are prohibited in other markets, are not limited to HFT, and have been shown to exist, although not exclusively, on many crypto exchanges as we discussed in a previous post.

In general, automated market making and arbitrage strategies create greater efficiency in the market as depicted in the above graphic by integrating information into prices more quickly and efficiently resulting in narrower bid/offer spreads, improved price discovery, and fewer and more-fleeting instances of price discrepancies across markets when an asset type, such as bitcoin, trades on multiple venues.

There is evidence that the cryptocurrency markets are experiencing these benefits on the more reputable exchanges as a result of increasing HFT participation.

In the past 2.5 years spreads have generally narrowed and become more stable, and price discrepancies across trading venues have become less dramatic and less frequent. The below graphic from a 2019 white paper Buying Bitcoin, published by the New York Digital Investment Group, demonstrates this effect from December 2016 through October 2018.

So, while there are a variety of trading strategies that can be automated and labeled “HFT,” some contribute to market quality while some detract from it.

It is important to note our definition of market quality includes deep liquidity and tight bid/offer spreads, supported by fair access, elimination or appropriate management of potential conflicts of interest, and technology that benefits participants.

Cloud vs Data Center Matching Engine

The CoinDesk article mistakenly states that ErisX has a “hardware matching engine.”

In fact, ErisX has located the hardware (servers etc.) upon which its matching engine software runs in a Tier 1 datacenter facility in New Jersey that services a high density of major financial firms including traditional exchanges, brokers and trading firms as well as communications firms, enabling all new and traditional participants to quickly and efficiently gain access to our markets.

Participants that already have a presence in this datacenter can connect to ErisX’s matching engine via a cross-connect and our FIX API. Additionally, ErisX offers connectivity to its matching engine over the internet via Websocket API.

There is nothing extraordinary about this model. In fact, deploying an exchange in a data center gives exchange operators the greatest control of their entire infrastructure from network firewalls and switches to servers.

This control enables exchange infrastructure to be precision-calibrated to create the most reliable, consistent and performant (lowest absolute latency and variability in latency) experience, promoting fairness amongst market participants. Participants can, in turn, precision-tune their trading systems and automated trading strategies; market participants that host their trading infrastructure in a datacenter (vs. the cloud) benefit from the same level of control and precision tuning. This is a good thing.

In contrast, cloud-based exchanges have less control over their infrastructure managed by the cloud operator in a shared general-purpose environment, and as a result cannot yet achieve the same level of reliability and performance offered by data center hosted exchanges.

To illustrate, at the risk of getting into the technical weeds, a world-class data center-hosted exchange may offer round-trip latency in the sub-100 microseconds (millionths of a second) range with 99th percentile consistency and the capability to process millions of orders per second, all with 99.99 percent uptime.

Cloud-based exchanges, on the other hand, may offer latency in the tens or hundreds of milliseconds (a thousand times slower) with less reliability, consistency and throughput due to the vagaries of internet routing algorithms. Further, cloud-based exchanges may rotate the location of the system running their matching engine periodically from one cloud datacenter to another, introducing even greater latency and inconsistency.

Low and predictable latency enables market participants to better manage their risk and pricing algorithms to ensure their best possible quotes are posted to exchanges creating high quality liquidity. In contrast, long round-trip order/quote/trade times resulting from high, unpredictable latency do not allow participants to react as fast to rapidly evolving market conditions. To compensate, participants may quote wider markets and thinner liquidity.

The CoinDesk article implies that by hosting in the cloud, exchanges create a fairer access model and/or protect retail investors. In fact, wider spreads and thinner liquidity are a detriment to all investors. The article also overlooks the reality that clouds run in data centers, and latency-sensitive market participants can locate their automated trading systems within, or close to the cloud data centers with or without explicit approval from exchanges – essentially unsanctioned “colocation.”

These firms access cloud exchanges faster than other participants, just with less reliability and determinism than with a data center-hosted exchange.

Conclusion

Automated market making and arbitrage, both forms of “high frequency trading” strategies, contribute to higher quality liquidity and markets, and the performance offered by data center-hosted exchanges enables these strategies to better manage risk and react to fast-moving markets.

In conclusion, we believe that constructive automated strategies and data center-colocated exchanges provide fair and consistent market performance with benefits for all participants.

Now, this probably won’t come as a shock, but the accountant we asked doesn’t recommend filing a crypto tax return yourself.

Tax laws are extremely complicated and even if you manage to avoid breaking the law, you still might end up missing some deductions you may be entitled to – or paying more tax than you should.

And just to reinforce the disclaimer: this guide should not be relied upon. If you have any questions AT ALL about your tax situation, you should contact a tax professional.

OK, you’ve decided to Do It Yourself

The first thing you’ll need to do is to sign up for CoinTracking.

The service is free for the first two hundred trades which should be more than enough for the average investor.

CoinTracking supports 70 major exchanges including Coinbase, Binance, Huobi, BTC Markets and more – so if all of your trades are on supported exchanges you’ll be able to import the data via API or csv exports.

Even if you don’t want to do your own taxes, Cointracking is a handy way to keep track of all your trades. Your accountant will be glad you’ve kept proper records.

That said, keeping it up to date requires a bit of diligence, especially if you need to enter trades manually.

We’re up to date for the past year

Let’s assume you’ve been able to import your trades for the past year, or have already been using the system since last year.

US residents are able to get a tax report at the touch of a button.

However, for Australians, there’s a bit more work to be done. You’ll need to get a report that simply works out our capital gains and losses, which you have to enter into your tax return.

The first step is to check the data entered. Allan Boyle from Australian Crypto Tax Chat and Rawson Verco Need accountants says there are few things to keep an eye out for.

“We’ve noticed that with CoinTracking, if there are ticker codes with more than three characters like WAVE, sometimes CT doesn’t pick up all the trades,” he says. “It was giving a $0 cost base.”

“Also we noticed the same coin might have different ticker codes on different exchanges. On some exchanges Bitcoin Cash was BCC and on other it was BCH”

If the ticker codes don’t match, then CoinTracking can’t match up the trades, leading to significant errors in your report.

Change settings to produce the tax report

Once you’re happy with the data (don’t worry, there are more opportunities to check or alter it) head to ‘tax report‘ and click ‘open settings and create a new tax report’.

Change the ‘tax year’ setting to ‘custom’ as it defaults to calendar year. You’ll need to change this to the past Australian financial year.

The ‘filter’ option lets you exclude various trade types such as income or mining or various exchanges. Most people should leave all these options on.

The ‘consider all previous trades’ option takes into account previous tax reports so leave it on. While you can turn off ‘group all purchases by day’ it’s not recommended as you’ll end up with a massively long report.

Most users won’t need to muck about with the ‘advanced options’ either.

Technically speaking the ATO would prefer the conversion setting to be ‘transaction prices’; (the actual price recorded by the exchange) but you’re able to select ‘best prices’ too, which as the name suggests gives more favorable prices from the average price across exchanges when converting into Australian dollars.

The method tab is a tricky one. First in, First Out it is the default option and is recommended for most people (and is the only option for traders).

There are other options too that enable you to select various ‘parcels’ of shares bought at particular prices: if you have large capital losses from previous years, you may wish to select ‘lowest cost, first out’ (especially in a declining market) which increases your capital gains so you can write off your losses against it.

But if you’re mucking about with these settings, you’re probably best off talking to an accountant for advice rather than doing it yourself.

Leave the ‘long term after 365 days’ as is. This setting will identify the trades you’ve made that are may be eligible for the 50% capital gains discount, which is can be applied once you’ve held a coin for more than a year before selling.

Now click on ‘generate a new tax report now!’

Don’t get excited, you’re only halfway through

Now you have to go through the report and work out if anything looks dodgy.

Click on ‘detailed calculation’ which will bring up the individual trades and how each one was calculated.

“If you see red writing anywhere, stop and have a look because that indicates it couldn’t find a cost basis for that parcel,” Boyle said.

If so, you’ll need to manually enter the correct details and run the report again.

Once you’ve worked out if all the trades are correct (and you’ll want to be very sure or else you’ll be submitting an incorrect tax return) then you can export the data as a CSV.

Boyle says he has simple advice for what to do at this point: “My answer is to give it to your accountant. But if not, you’ll need to work it all out”.

Essentially what you need to do is to work out:

the short term (less than 12 months) gains

the long term (more than 12 months gains)

any losses.

You can apply the losses against the short term gains, and any leftover can be applied to the long term gains, which may be eligible for the 50% discount.

For example: “If you’ve got $1000 in short gains and $2000 in long gains and $1500 in losses, the $1500 can cover the short gains, and $500 towards the long gains, leaving $1500. Then you can apply the 50% discount to that.”

My head hurts

Let’s take a very basic example:

You made $100 short term gains on Ethereum

You made $100 short term gains on Dogecoin

You made $100 long term gains on Bitcoin

You lost $200 on VeChain

In this scenario, you have $200 short term gains, $100 long term gains and $200 losses.

The $200 worth of losses can write off the $200 short term gains, meaning you only need to pay tax on the $100 long term gains from Bitcoin. Which is probably eligible for the 50% capital gains discount.

On your tax return

In the unlikely event you’re filling out a paper tax return:

Net losses are entered at 18V (We don’t have any net losses in our example)

The overall capital gains are entered in 18H ($300 in our example, made up of the $200 worth of short term gains plus $100 long term gains – we ignore losses here)

The net capital gains after the discount have been applied go in 18A ($100 X 50% = $50)

How to enter the figures in MyGov’s online tax return

Tick the box that says you had Australian interest or other income/loss

Tick the box for Capital Gains and on the next screen scroll to Capital Gains or Losses, click Add/Edit.

MyGov doesn’t use return labels, so 18H is labelled “Total current year capital gains”

18A is labelled “Net capital gain” If this number goes negative, enter $0 here and the balance at “Net capital loss carried forward to later income years.”

18V is labelled ‘Net Capital Loss carried forward’. In our example we won’t add anything in here, but if you lost $20,000 on crypto and only made $5000 in profits, you could enter $15,000 here which you can use to minimize your tax bill next year.

Important to note

It’s important to note that if you have any other capital gains events, like selling shares, you’ll also need to include the short term gains, long term gains, and losses to carry forward in these sections of your tax return.

Add the various figures TOGETHER with the corresponding figures from your crypto portfolio.

And that’s it. Again, if you have any questions you’ll need to consult a tax professional. If you think any of this information is in error, contact me on [email protected] and I’ll seek further clarification.",2019-07-28 00:30:34+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

Belarusian IT investor and entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya is pictured at his office in London, Britain July 15, 2019. Picture taken July 15, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Wilson

The meeting, Prokopenya said, ended with Lukashenko asking him to propose regulations to boost the country’s tech sector. Prokopenya worked with IT firms and lawyers to draft guidelines to cash in on an emerging digital industry: cryptocurrencies.

Some two years later, the rules are in place. Investors can trade bitcoin on an exchange run by Prokopenya, while other companies are launching their own cryptocurrency platforms.

“The idea was to create everything from scratch,” Prokopenya told Reuters in an interview in London. “To make sure that it is free in some of the aspects it needs to be free, and very stringent in other aspects.”

Contacted for comment, Lukashenko's office directed Reuters to an account of the meeting here on the president's website.

Belarus is among a handful of smaller countries coming up with specific rule books for digital currencies. Their efforts could help shape the development of the global market and the growth of industry players, from exchange platforms to brokers.

So far, cryptocurrency companies have often had to choose between two extremes when deciding where to set up shop.

Major financial centers like London and New York, which apply traditional financial services rules to the sector, might be attractive to big institutions seeking safety but the compliance complexity and costs preclude many of the startups at the heart of the fledgling industry.

Conversely, lightly-regulated jurisdictions like the Seychelles and Belize allow far easier market access. But states with light rules can offer less protection for investors and have looser checks on money laundering, lawyers say.

The likes of Belarus and other newer entrants - including Bahrain, Malta and Gibraltar - are seeking to offer a third way: crafting specific rules for the cryptocurrency sector, betting they can attract companies by providing regulatory security as well as perks like tax breaks.

While there is no guarantee of success, cryptocurrencies represent a rare chance for these states or territories to grab a slice of an emerging market, potentially attracting investment and creating jobs, at a time when big financial hubs are adopting a more conservative, “wait-and-see” approach.

“There are jurisdictions in the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil camp,” said Jesse Overall, a lawyer at Clifford Chance in New York specializing in crypto regulation. “On the other end there is the U.S., UK, EU. In the middle, that’s the juicy part of the spectrum.”

Overall said both countries and companies could benefit from the emergence of frameworks specifically for cryptocurrencies. But states that get the rules wrong could fall foul of global rules to stamp out illicit use of digital coins, he added.

Indeed, there are major questions over whether these nations will be able to consistently prevent the hacks and illegal activities, such as money laundering, that plague the opaque sector and could hammer their reputations as secure centers.

Another risk of building rules for an unpredictable and rapidly evolving industry is that they could soon become outdated.

‘CARROTS WITH NO STICKS’

ZPX, a Singapore-based crypto firm, will launch a cryptocurrency trading platform, Qume, next month catering to institutional investors such as high-frequency proprietary trading firms and hedge funds.

It has decided to base the business in Bahrain’s capital Manama - and the considerations it faced are emblematic of the quandary confronting many players across the industry.

ZPX’s CEO Ramani Ramachandran said it decided against operating in a so-called offshore jurisdiction with low or no regulation. Such a base could deter big investors as scrutiny of digital coins heats up from global regulators and politicians, he said.

“As the market matures analogous to traditional capital markets, mainstream institutional capital will increasingly look to come to regulated exchanges such as Qume as opposed to ‘light-touch’ venues in offshore jurisdictions.”

Bahrain launched rules in February for cryptocurrency companies such as trading platforms, including rigorous customer background checks, governance standards and controls on cyber security risks.

It’s also usually far cheaper in terms of compliance and administration costs to set up in smaller locations like Bahrain than in major financial hubs, said Ramachandran.

ZPX estimates such costs would come to around $200,000 a year in Bahrain, versus at least $750,000 a year in London.

Another advantage of setting up in a smaller country, said ZPX co-founder Aditya Mishra, was the close communication companies could have with regulators, something that would be difficult in a big financial center. Bahrain also offered good access to Gulf markets, he added.

Another cryptocurrency trading platform, iExchange, began operating in the Belarusian capital Minsk this month, aiming to attract investors from the CIS market of Russia and the former Soviet states.

Co-founder Igor Snizhko said Belarus was the best option because it had a regulatory framework that other countries in the region lacked.

Belarus demands audits of issuers of digital coins and details of the projects underpinning any issuance. For trading platforms, the rules include keeping tabs on suspicious transactions to meet international money laundering standards.

“For many the CIS market is very promising and very dangerous at the same time,” he added. “Many large and accomplished players are still afraid of one factor - a lack of transparency. We didn’t want to work in any ‘grey’ jurisdiction.”

Sweeteners offered by Belarus include tax breaks for companies mining or trading cryptocurrencies. The rules, described by PwC as “carrots with no sticks,” also give firms looser rules on currency controls and visas.

In the United States, by contrast, digital coin transactions are taxable. In Britain, capital gains taxes apply.

iExchange said it had also initially looked at other countries including Estonia and Malta, but chose Belarus because of its proximity to its target market.

BESPOKE APPROACH

The size of the global cryptocurrency sector is hard to gauge because of its complexity and lack of transparency. Still, Ireland-based Research and Markets reckons the sector will grow to $1.4 billion by 2024 from $1 billion this year. Other estimates see a faster rate of growth.

Crypto regulations vary through the world. While Facebook’s unveiling of its Libra coin has prompted signs of a coordinated backlash against cryptocurrencies by major economies, a patchwork of approaches still rules from country to country.

China has even banned cryptocurrencies outright, while an Indian government panel last week recommended a similar measure.

Sui Chung of Crypto Facilities, a London-based cryptocurrency futures exchange, said there were clear benefits to being in a major financial hub, including having access to highly skilled employees.

“You need to be in place where you can get the staff,” he said. “Our product teams, development teams have financial institution experience.”

Being regulated in an established center can also allow companies access to deeper, more liquid markets and provide greater certainty on securities law, said Ann Sofie Cloots, one of the authors of a Cambridge University study on cryptocurrency regulation.

“It may mean you have a more sophisticated investor base, greater access to capital,” she said. “It’s also a reputational thing.”

To be sure, it is not just the likes of Belarus and Bahrain that have coined their own crypto rules: Some larger countries like France and Japan have also made moves in that direction.

But it’s the smaller countries that have tended to launch the most sophisticated “bespoke” approaches, according to the Cambridge University study.

That could bring clarity to both cryptocurrency companies and related services like banks previously wary of the sector’s unclear legal status, said Cloots.

Belarus entrepreneur Prokopenya, whose Instagram posts of sports cars in Cyprus and beaches in Dubai are followed by 5.6 million people, acknowledged the risks that came with blockchain technology, including the potential for money laundering.

But he said these could be mitigated with clear regulation, and that countries like Belarus should not miss out on a chance to grab a slice of an emerging market.

“The biggest risks come from not taking any risks,” he said.",2019-07-29 06:06:40+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenizing-sports-how-the-industry-is-incorporating-crypto,"Cryptocurrencies and digital tokens have become powerful tools for a variety of industries over the past few years, and the world of sports is no exception. Sports fans are notoriously passionate about the teams they support, and there is a massive market for everything from tickets to memorabilia, collectibles and content.

As the world continues to move online, sports teams and organizations are beginning to embrace the use of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens to give fans access to exclusive content and items using these new technologies. This move toward crypto-acceptance has been happening for some time in the sporting space. As early as 2014, the NBA team Sacramento Kings began accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment method for tickets and merchandise, in a move that was considered a first in the sports industry.

From then onward, a swathe of organizations have begun to explore the use of digital tokens. In this article, Cointelegraph takes a look at the biggest sports teams and how they’re adopting digital tokens and cryptocurrency to provide their fans with the latest in e-commerce and user engagement.

Football scores big with crypto

Football — or as it is called in United States, soccer — is by far the most popular sport on Earth. According to FIFA’s audit of audience data following the 2018 World Cup in Russia, over 3.5 billion people tuned in to watch the global showpiece. This number suggests that half of the world’s population caught some of the action during the competition — a staggering thought that hammers home the popularity of the game. Given the potential number of people reached by the sport, any product or advertiser associated with the biggest football brands are almost guaranteed to benefit from the exposure.

The fans have a notoriously insatiable appetite for memorabilia, including anything from jerseys to signed apparel. The biggest football teams have mammoth fan bases across the world, which are looking for a more immersive experience to support their team. A number of Europe’s biggest teams have adopted a blockchain-based solution that gives fans a number of token-powered utilities to interact with the team. Juventus, Paris Saint Germaine, West Ham and Roma have all engaged in their own partnerships with the blockchain-based fan engagement platform Socios.

The platform enables these teams to launch their own fan tokens, which can then be used by fans on the platform. Using their tokens, they can participate in votes on things like changes to the club’s jersey while also having access to exclusive content and memorabilia. Socios has two types of voting mechanisms: binding and nonbinding. A binding vote means that the club has to carry out whatever the outcome of a vote is. So, if the fans vote for a color change of their jersey, the club will have to make good on its promise. Given that the votes are carried out on a blockchain platform means they cannot be tampered with or erased.

It is an interesting use case for blockchain, and the fact that these high-profile clubs have jumped on board is a great endorsement for the sector. Socios’ system uses the Chiliz cryptocurrency token. The company recently announced a new partnership with major cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance. Part of this deal could see Chiliz listed on the crypto exchange.

This partnership speaks volumes for the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency use in sports. As Socios CEO Alex Dreyfus noted, the global sports audience is estimated to be around 3.5 billion people, indicating how many people can be reached through the sector.

Also, the Portuguese football club Benfica began accepting cryptocurrency payment for merchandise and tickets in June 2019, through the cryptocurrency platform Utrust. The move was mainly driven to meet the demands of over 7 million fans on social media. Supporters can make purchases using BTC, Ether (ETH) and Utrust tokens.

Over and above all these deals and endorsements, a number of prominent soccer players, such as the Barcelona star Lionel Messi, have also promoted various cryptocurrency and blockchain projects.

Crypto advertising in sports

Sports and betting have had a long history, and the latter is intrinsically linked to the former. The nature of cryptocurrencies has seen them leveraged as a means to facilitate gambling and betting. The success of betting companies has seen many become major sponsors of sports teams around the world. Cryptocurrency-based betting companies have also come to the fore in this regard with two major English Premier League football sides accepting sponsorships.

In 2018, Prem heavyweights Arsenal signed an advertising deal with California-based gambling company CashBet. The company was set to launch its native cryptocurrency, the CashBet Coin, in January 2019. The deal would see CashBet Coin advertised during Arsenal’s home games at the Emirates Stadium during the Premier League season. Cointelegraph has contact Arsenal to verify if the partnership is ongoing in 2019.

Another Premier League club, the Wolverhampton Wanderers, has an ongoing advertising deal with cryptocurrency exchange CoinDeal. The company’s logo appeared on the sleeve of the Wolves’ jersey during the 2018-2019 season — and the parties have now agreed to a new deal for the upcoming football season.

Alson in 2018, eToro made waves with an advertising sponsorship involving seven Premier League sides that was paid entirely with Bitcoin. The deal would see eToro branding featured on pitch side advertising boards and other mediums. Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur, Brighton and Hove Albion, Cardiff, Crystal Palace, Leicester City and Southampton were part of the deal made last year. The campaign also included the launch of eToro FC, which provided educational material, tutorials and market news to members of the community.

2019 has seen more recent endorsements deals between cryptocurrency firms and sports teams. Over in the U.S., the NBA outfit Cleveland Cavaliers announced a new partnership with cryptocurrency exchange UnitedCoin that would see the firm advertised at the team’s stadium. It would also be promoted on the social media platforms of the club esports team, Cavs Legion, and during online competitions.

Following that, the Miami Dolphins partnered with Litecoin (LTC) as the NFL team’s official cryptocurrency. The deal would see Litecoin advertised through branding at the team’s stadium. Dolphins fans will also be able to purchase team raffle tickets using Litecoin and Bitcoin, with half of those proceeds going to charities supported by the team.

First crypto-collectibles in sport

The rise of Ethereum unlocked new potentials with cryptocurrencies through the advent of smart contracts. It didn’t take long for projects like CryptoKitties to explode in popularity, as Ethereum users clamored to get their hands on the valuable crypto collectibles.

Major League Baseball team Los Angeles Dodgers took the concept and introduced the first ever crypto-giveaway at a sports event in September 2018. The first 40,000 fans to enter their stadium for its match against the Padres received a crypto token to download a digital bobblehead of three of their players. The collectible would then be added to the users’ Ethereum wallets. It scratches the surface of collectibles but provides an interesting use case of how a blockchain platform like Ethereum can be used to provide sports fans with collectibles and other exclusive digital content.

A glimpse of things to come?

There is no denying the influence and reach that sports have around the world. Audience numbers for the most popular sports are in the hundreds of millions and this has massive potential for potential advertisers. Given that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have only been around for just over a decade, their proliferation into this sector is impressive.

Partnerships with the biggest teams in European football — as well as breaking into the American audience for basketball and American football — cannot be understated, and advertising alone is bound to introduce new users to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

It’s easy to imagine that online fan engagement and sales will be driven by tokenized platforms in the future, and teams that are already exploring these avenues could have a big advantage over those that haven’t, as of yet. Sports have always brought people together and influenced the lives of many — and the right campaigns and tools are bound to succeed when partnering with the right platforms.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-is-part-of-free-speech-and-free-speech-is-everything/,"Crypto Is Part of Free Speech, and Free Speech Is Everything

On July 23, U.S. Attorney General William Barr gave a speech demanding big players in the tech industry work with government agencies in providing backdoor entry points for encrypted devices and software. Per his reasoning, certain devices and messaging services pose a safety threat by providing a secure, third-party-inaccessible area where crime can rapidly proliferate. He didn’t note that this “warrant-proof encryption” also protects journalists, researchers, and individuals in areas of political unrest living under corrupt governments. Secure encryption also protects and verifies the financial assets and transactions of cryptocurrency holders everywhere. If strings of code — ideas, in essence — are now being made illegal, it would appear that a brand new battle for humanity’s free expression is just beginning.

Crypto Is Free Speech

Article 19 of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: “Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.”

Of course, governments worldwide, and the UN itself, do not abide by this proclamation, but that last point is still of critical importance. The reception, transmission, and search for information via any media “regardless of frontiers” is part of free speech. Crypto is a technology. An idea. And it’s not limited by geographical constraints or “frontiers.” It’s a means by which to impart, receive, and seek information. After all, a bitcoin transaction or encrypted message is, in essence, an expression of information.

The Hypocritical Outlawing of Ideas

At the end of the day, the encryption Barr is speaking out against is simply code. There is nothing nefarious about a private, secure means of communication in and of itself, as these technologies are simply tools. Much like the stupefying irony of U.S. leaders maintaining that bitcoin gets its value from “thin air” while simultaneously demanding taxes on it, Barr sounds equally absurd for his hypocrisy.

The police and government agencies he refers to depend on virtually impenetrable privacy and encryption themselves to maintain their own security. His government, whose leaders warn against “Swiss bank accounts” in the pockets of crypto holders, is still busy recklessly devaluing the national currency and letting drug trafficking banks off the hook without prosecution. While this guy who redacted the Mueller report drones on about the need for transparency, Edward Snowden is still viewed as an enemy of the state, and everyday individuals are being viewed as suspected criminals before having committed any crime.

Australia and the Five Eyes Dragnet

In his address, Barr cited Australia, which has already begun its experiment in legislation for installing backdoor entry points to encrypted communications services:

Many of our international partners such as the UK and Australia are already moving on statutory frameworks.

Having no federal bill of rights, Australia is an ideal place for world powers to begin their dystopian assault on cryptographic communication. If information requests are funneled through Australian channels, other Five Eyes (FVEY) alliance nations (Canada, New Zealand, U.K. and U.S.) can garner signals intelligence info unavailable due to domestic restrictions. There have already been multiple court rulings regarding the illegal outsourcing of intelligence between FVEY countries, and accusations of selling data as well.

What This Means for Bitcoin

Should the current state of crypto continue unchallenged down under, it’s not hard to imagine similar legislation increasing in scope in Australia, and also coming to other FVEY nations soon. As such, many are concerned about the safety of their crypto holdings as well as their communications.

How all of this is going to affect cryptocurrencies and their related decentralized applications (dapps) largely remains to be seen. The ill-defined requirements for demanding cooperation from tech providers in Australia depend on the government’s view that “the request is reasonable and proportionate,” among other vague criteria.

Should non-custodial wallets and similar services eventually be targeted, the whole feasibility of a secure and thriving trustless payment network could be called into question. If backdoors are demanded on a service, there’s little meaning in holding crypto with that service. VPNs and domain fronting might help where secure options are made illegal or unavailable in certain regions, but as the worldwide dragnet expands, users could be forced to use only centrally managed, state regulated platforms and apps — a fate much worse than cold, hard cash, as far as privacy goes. At that point, one other option would be to continue with secure money by any means possible, even if it means becoming an outlaw.

Rebel Heroes of Private Freedom

Edward Snowden is considered an “enemy of the state” for holding the state accountable, exposing evidence of criminal spying to the disinfectant light of day. His is a high profile example, but it is not so different, in essence, from anyone choosing to express themselves freely when there is information they wish to share — be it a strong conviction about something, a funny message to a friend or loved one, or a secure string of hashed information to provide financial relief to someone across the globe, without worrying about fees or interference from a third party.

As Snowden confirmed, the NSA was using phony services promising anonymity to trap bitcoin users. Australia has made secure communications privacy outright illegal. The U.S. now wants to follow suit. In light of these realities, one cannot be too careful about staying safe and secure. Without fully open source, secure and private systems of expression — financial, linguistic, journalistic or otherwise — there is ultimately nothing to be had but the colorless, muted silence of a terrorized world afraid to say or express anything, before too long.

However, during the migration, some assets may be unavailable to use (exchange, send, and withdraw) for a few minutes while the migration takes place. The migration will impact some segments of U.S. users more directly, such as the following:

A 20-Year Banking Relationship Broken by Bitcoin

Banks, like politicians, are a necessary evil. Few people wax lyrical about them, but begrudgingly accept that they are an unavoidable part of civilized society. In the 20 years I’ve banked with Natwest, I’ve had plenty of cause to bitch about them. Their service is poor and their products inadequate, and like most of their kind, will have gone the way of print media in a decade, as better forms of money and better means of doing business render the banking system obsolete. In the here and now, though, I depend on my bank, because a man can’t live on crypto alone.

Banking is one of the few constants in our lives. Friends and employers come and go, but ever since opening an account in our formative years, we are prone to sticking with our bank through thick and thin. I was no different up until Wednesday, when my tenure with Natwest came to an abrupt end after they pulled the rug from under my feet, prompting me to rage quit. As a result, I no longer have a bank account, a resource that most people my age would not only take for granted, but would have toiled over for years to accrue a five-figure balance at minimum.

The story of my banking blockade isn’t tragic or deserving of sympathy. But it warrants telling nonetheless, for it will be familiar to a number of readers who have bought or sold bitcoin. If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.

A Plague on All Your Banking Houses

Like most people who work in the cryptoconomy, I have cause to cash out bitcoin for fiat sporadically to pay the bills. I’ve used Localbitcoins (LBC) for this purpose since 2013, typically selling a couple of hundred bucks at a time, with the buyer transferring the funds to my bank account. On occasions, I’ve had cause to sell higher amounts, but never enough to trigger money laundering checks or prompt awkward questions from the bank. I’m not that dumb. As a result, I’ve successfully completed hundreds of trades on LBC without triggering the involvement of my bank.

All that changed in an instant on Wednesday. I went to meet a mate for a drink, but when I tried to withdraw cash from an ATM, my card wouldn’t work. I went into the bar and tried to pay by card, asking the barman to run it through the machine before pouring my pint. It was also declined. Figuring Natwest’s entire banking system might be down (not everything runs as reliably as Bitcoin), I opened my mobile banking app, only to find I was locked out of that too.

As someone who works in cryptocurrency, I’m acutely aware of the risks posed by social engineering, and it was at this point that I glanced at the 4G symbol on my phone to check I hadn’t been SIM swapped. Mercifully, nothing seemed to be amiss there, but I was still without access to funds, and no closer to finding out why. As anyone who’s ever had their card blocked while abroad will attest, it induces a feeling of helplessness coupled with embarrassment at having your purchase declined. I wasn’t freaking out, but I was pissed off. Now I would have to phone my bank in a bid to find out what was wrong. I hate phoning people.

‘Suspicious Activity’

10 minutes of pre-recorded disclaimers and muzak later and I was connected to a telephone operator who confirmed that a block had been placed on my account, but they couldn’t inform me why – that would require transferring me to another department, with another dash of muzak while I waited, for good measure.

“Okay, so there’s been a block placed on your account because we’ve been asked to investigate two suspicious transactions dating from the third of May,” I was told. “There’s one for £1,000 and another for £8,000 with pay-in references … do you recognize these?”

A couple of points immediately stood out. Firstly, these incidents took place six weeks ago, and they’re only acting on it now? And secondly, I can’t even recall what I had for breakfast yesterday – how am I meant to recall two of the several hundred transactions to pass through my account since the start of May? Especially since I can’t log in and view the information pertaining to them, because I no longer have banking access.

Incidentally, losing your banking account doesn’t just cut off your funding: you also lose access to all the payment details you had stored for friends, direct debits, child support, car insurance and the rest. You have to message clients telling them not to pay into your account and friends requesting they resend their banking details. It’s a total ball-ache.

Bitcoin Is Bad, M’kay?

Based on the pay-in references the banking official reads off, I’m all but certain these are Localbitcoins sales, though I’ve no idea why they should have been flagged as suspicious. £1,000 isn’t remotely high enough to trigger AML checks, nor is it the highest amount I’ve ever cashed out. I refrain from mentioning the B-word to the banker, not because I fear the repercussions of admitting to trading bitcoin, but because it’s none of his god-damn business.

I have no idea who I sold those coins to – they were two pseudonymous usernames out of hundreds on LBC – and I don’t want to know either. I couldn’t care less whether the bitcoin I sold them was being used to purchase methamphetamine or depleted uranium: that’s none of my business. Moreover, even if I wanted to due diligence my counterparties, I would have no means of doing so. What I do know is this: the people I sold those coins to were regular LBC traders, who do this sort of thing day in, day out. As a result, the likelihood of those two transactions involving any sort of fraudulent or nefarious activity is extremely low.

I don’t tell any of this to the official on the other end of the line. Instead, I maintain my calm and point out the inconvenience of having my account shuttered without warning, cutting off all financial access. I point out that if the bank wanted to discuss these transactions with me, they have all my details – phone, address, email – and thus there was no need to freeze my account to get my attention. I then suggest that if they wish to obtain my assistance in investigating these “suspicious” transactions, restoring my account would be a good first step.

The employee tells me they can’t do that until I’ve complied with the request, and that’s when I politely tell him where to go. “We’re through.” I hang up the phone, and at that moment, my 20-year relationship with the banking world comes to an end. Sure, I could cooperate and beg for my account back, but that’s not my style. I have a problem with authority and being told what to do. Besides, how do you prove a negative, and show that a crime hasn’t been permitted? Fuck you Natwest and the horse you rode in on. Fuck you Natwest, Clydesdale, Wells Fargo and every other crumbling bank that thinks it can decide how its customers should spend their money. Your demise can’t come fast enough.

Thanks for reaching out to us. Unfortunately, Wells Fargo does not allow transactions involving cryptocurrency. -Josh — Ask Wells Fargo (@Ask_WellsFargo) July 12, 2019

Same Shit, Different Customer

On the very same day that I was rage quitting on Natwest, I received a message from another LBC trader. He had no idea of the ordeal I’d just experienced, but had one of his own to share. “I feel like I’m being hounded by the banks,” he began. “Not only has my 20 year old halifax acc had a block put on it, but now my Revolut acc has been frozen with all my cash in there! Which bank, or fintech bank would you recommend using for this kind of business?”

I wasn’t in a position to recommend any banks, but I was interested in learning more about his predicament. He continued: “Revolut wanted me to explain where I got the 800 quid to start trading, I told them the truth – I sold a bike, an ipad. I then had to show them my trading history on lbc, then they asked for my tax statement(??), I told them I don’t have a tax statement, they then asked again!”

The intrusive and unreasonable questions didn’t stop there. Revolut proceeded to ask the guy why he had 50-100 BTC trading volume listed on his LBC account (which, for the record, is a low amount). He told Revolut that he was trading in an Asian country during the 2017 boom, before moving back to the UK, whereupon he decided to use what little money he had to try again. At this point, Revolut asked to see his residency permit for the country he’d been in. He explained that he wasn’t a resident there, and they asked him to produce his travel visa instead, which he reluctantly did. Revolut then said they would get back to him. Meanwhile, his account containing £800 remains suspended.

Unregulated peer to peer money is an existential threat to all governments. Why? Simple. To govern is to control. Money that doesn't allow centralized issuance or control strikes directly at this. This fight has only begun. Freedom money won't be free. — Palley (@stephendpalley) July 28, 2019

Crypto businesses aren’t exempted from banking troubles either – in fact obtaining a reliable bank is often one of the greatest challenges blockchain companies face. “Startups in Europe encounter difficulties with opening a bank account. It will take at least a month and a half, dealing with all those long and complicated KYC and AML procedures,” explains Max Demyan, CEO at GEO Protocol. He added:

But if you are a crypto startup, like us, it is nearly impossible to get to proper banking in the EU. Some crypto startups end up opening a bank account in the U.S. It is fairly easy, but in this case they will encounter problems later with the U.S. tax authorities.

Frozen, Seized and Shuttered for What Exactly?

It’s hard to work out what any of this has to do with bitcoin – or to crime for that matter. Blackstone’s ratio famously holds that: “It is better that 10 guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer.” The banks and their cronies – the governments and three-letter agencies including the IRS – would rather that 10 innocent people be criminalized than one guilty person should break the law. In the U.S., there are citizens currently facing jail for trading bitcoin. And we’re not talking about real crimes here, either: we’re talking about invented meme crimes like money laundering, which only exist because of a war on plants.

But I digress. The point of this lengthy diatribe is thus: until such a time as it’s possible to be out and proud about bitcoin, keep that shit schtum. Don’t mention it to your bank, hint at it, or receive a pay-in reference that could be in any way associated with it. Even if you do take all reasonable precautions, however, if you’re a frequent bitcoin trader, you’re liable to fall foul of the banking system sooner or later. When that happens, you’ll have two choices: grovel to have your account reinstated, or flip them the bird and take your business elsewhere.

As for me, I think I’m gonna go dark for a while. I’ll still sell coins on LBC and local.bitcoin.com, but I’m not clamoring to open another bank account any time soon. After 20 years, it feels strangely liberating to no longer be at the mercy of the banks. Bye, Felicia.

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

In last week’s column — my third on Libra — I referred to a core dilemma confronting the cryptocurrency project’s financial inclusion goals: the impossibility of being both pro-privacy and pro-KYC.

I promise a break this week from Libra and its controversial founder, Facebook. But I want to dive deeper into that dilemma because the problem is hardly unique to that project. As “know-your-customer” rules have steadily encroached into their world, all cryptocurrency startups trying to expand financial access for the poor are hamstrung by requirements to identify and track the people they seek to serve.

This contradiction stems from tough policies contained under Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism rules (AML-CFT), which were tightened worldwide after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and then again after the financial crisis. Since virtually every bank needs access to dollars, KYC rules everywhere tend to follow models laid down in the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and in guidelines of the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. Further internationalizing pressure comes from the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, which sets the regulatory standards by which countries pressure each other to comply.

This network of rules, which empower enforcement agencies to impose stiff fines, hold the Sword of Damocles over bankers’ heads, driving them into risk-averse positions. Bank compliance officers need only mention HSBC (fined $1.9 billion for enabling Mexican drug money laundering) or Standard Chartered (hit with a $1.1 billion fine for similar lapses with Iran) to convince their bosses of a rigorous approach to identifying and profiling customers.

Yet it’s not clear these measures are effective. The UnitedNations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that a 2-5% of global GDP, or between $800 billion and $2 trillion, is still being laundered each year. Would the figures be higher without these tough rules? Maybe. But we have no counterfactual against which to measure performance.

Criminals still have a host of mechanisms to move money around and avoid sanctions. Yes, some use bitcoin – which is why the FATF this year introduced tougher rules for what it calls “virtual asset service providers” – but cryptocurrency’s role is far smaller than that played by fiat currency banknotes. And as revealed in the Panama Papers in 2015, all sorts of shady entities continue to help crooked politicians and their financiers hide identities and obscure money movements.

What we do know is that these rules hinder financial inclusion.

Caribbean governments, for example, complain that their economies have increasingly suffered “de-risking,” as tougher compliance has stanched investment flows to the islands.

The consequences are even more severe for poorer countries, where state-led IDs are either non-existent or easily forged. The heavy scrutiny that foreign banks apply to their counterparties in FATF-labeled “high-risk jurisdictions” means the bar for businesses and individuals in those countries to obtain local banking services is very high. It’s a key reason why 2 billion people worldwide are considered “unbanked.”

This, of course, has a negative impact on poverty, which in turn feeds crime and terrorism – the very problems AML-CFT is intended to fight.

Consider Somalia, a failed state whose institutions are often blacklisted by the world’s biggest banks. It’s difficult and costly for Somalian expats to send money home to family members who rely on such remittances. This perpetuates poverty, drives people into informal payment systems and fosters the disenfranchising economic conditions in which terrorist organizations such as the Somali-based Al Shabaab thrive.

Talk about a perverse effect.

Is cryptocurrency the answer?

The Cypherpunk answer is to say, screw governments. People should use bitcoin, since it enables peer-to-peer digital payments without the intermediation of a regulated entity.

The problem lies at the crypto on- and off-ramps, where government surveillance has become ever more intense. The FATF’s new “travel rule” says cryptocurrency exchanges should be required to obtain information, not only about their customers but also on their customers’ customers, forcing cross-exchange information-sharing. This suggests the only environment where cryptocurrency transactions will be free from KYC exists solely between self-custody wallets. The minute a transaction touches the custodial structure that underpins most exchanges, cryptocurrency will be subject to KYC reporting.

Decentralized exchanges, or DEXes, which provide price and matching services but take no custody of clients’ coins, might be a way around this problem. Recent FinCEN guidance excluded them from the definition of regulated money service businesses in the U.S.

However, cryptocurrency advocacy group Coin Center has raised concerns that the FATF’s definition of regulated “virtual asset service providers” includes a vague reference to entities which “transfer” funds. Vagueness creates uncertainty, which as we’ve seen with bank compliance officers, is toxic to risk appetites. Many lawyers will advise their DEX clients to impose KYC to be on the safe side.

Also, with Helsinki-based LocalBitcoins announcing new KYC rules this year due to a new Finnish anti-money laundering law, it has become much harder for people to find each other in person and agree on a price for exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat without being officially surveilled.

In any case, it’s simply impractical for people in the developing world to use bitcoin as their main unit of account and medium of exchange. Perhaps Libra, with its basket-based stability mechanism, could evolve into a day-to-day payment vehicle, but as we saw from David Marcus’s testimony to Congress, that corporate-backed project will require KYC.

Bottom line: the poor need an easy-access fiat on-ramp.

Monitoring tech advances

We’re back to square one: financial inclusion goals suffer at the expense of governments’ crime-fighting objectives.

One could argue governments should decriminalize money – combat the actual crimes of drug trafficking, arms dealing, and so forth, but treat the right to exchange value as a human right. Let’s be realistic, though: that isn’t going to happen.

So, how to escape this vicious cycle? The answer may lie in blockchain technology’s own capacity to track transfers between pseudonymous accounts – though not as currently applied.

For some time, transaction-trackers such as Elliptic and Chainalysis have helped law enforcement agencies trace cryptocurrency payments to and from bad guys and provided rigorous AML monitoring audit services to companies.

Now, newcomers such as the Coral Protocol and CipherTrace are using high-tech network analyses and cryptographic protections to help businesses share cryptocurrency metadata to flag suspicious behavior without revealing their customers’ personal identifying information, or PII. These could make it easier for companies to comply with the FATF travel rule and generally create a more sophisticated, systemic analysis of risk.

Quite apart from KYC rules, there’s real value here for a cryptocurrency economy increasingly dominated by “bots.”

Still, there’s no way around the law. At the on- and off-ramps, customers must be ID’ed. And, under order from a law enforcement agency armed with these sophisticated tracking tools, a firm must crack open the black box and release the PII to the authorities.

A new mindset

What if, though, governments concede that it’s both impossible and unnecessary to formally identify poor people at the on and off-ramps? What if they accepted an AML model that treats the endpoints as unidentified nodes and, drawing on these new analytic tools, actively managed access to networks based on behavior not identity?

Here, ongoing research in machine learning and high-performance computing by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab in collaboration with Elliptic could be a catalyst. As described by lab researcher Mark Weber, the team uses an approach known as “graph convolutional networks” to create enhanced money flow forensics to address the challenges posed by the “complex layering and obfuscation schemes utilized by sophisticated criminal networks.”

Mapping a massive pool of bitcoin transactions, the researchers have isolated patterns that distinguish between illicit and licit behavior. In a forthcoming paper, they posit their work as a contribution to financial inclusion goals.

One day businesses might use such tools to control access points to cryptocurrency networks without applying traditional KYC, ensuring that good guys get financial services but bad guys don’t, even if neither is furnishing an official ID.

Would regulators go for it? Not, it would seem, under the current mindset. Compliance is used to identify and catch criminals, not as way to control access per se. If anything, the regulatory trend has been toward a greater dependence on state ID and ever more conservative treatment of “high-risk” poor people by financial institutions.

Cryptocurrency compliance expert Juan Llanos complains that regulators “are not open to innovation.” He adds, “As long as government ID is the standard, we are going to have this problem. Anything anonymous is controversial and not allowed. It’s very unfortunate.”

Still, the FATF’s latest round of deliberations did contain one olive branch to innovators: a willingness to explore the potential for “digital identity provided by governments or by the private sector.”

Combine that “private sector” line with a brief reference in Libra’s white paper to “portable digital identity” as a financial inclusion solution, and one can at least imagine financial and tech companies such as those the Libra Association’s members hashing out an onboarding solution for the poor that no longer depends on the outdated notion of state IDs.

This approach won’t satisfy hardline privacy advocates, who rightly view exchange as a human right.

But as a pragmatic solution, it’s perhaps the best hope that the world’s 2 billion unbanked have.

What people think is Bitcoin – the Bitcoin Core (BTC) network – had its scaling capacity crippled with a tiny block size, became congested, and spiked high transaction fees. Merchants and consumers will not use a payment system that is slow and costly. Luckily, Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged in November 2018 to fix that. BSV will ensure Bitcoin’s “Satoshi Vision” succeeds by massively scaling with big blocks to support a big global payment system.

Bitcoin Core (BTC) did not fulfil Bitcoin’s original vision

Bitcoin’s transformative concept was enabling people to instantly send cash directly to anyone globally, without intermediary banks or service providers. Transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger known as the blockchain, with blocks of transactions added on average every 10 minutes.

Bitcoin’s blockchain actually began with no limit on the block size. Back in April 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto (my colleague, nChain Chief Scientist Dr. Craig Wright) wrote this:

“The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling.”

However, early in Bitcoin’s life, a 1MB block cap was installed as a temporary measure to protect the network from attack in its early days. But for their own ulterior purposes, the Bitcoin Core development group (which now controls the BTC protocol) kept the 1MB block cap as permanent, rather than temporary.

1MB blocks are tiny; they only allow an average of 3 transactions per second. Compare that to Visa’s global network which averages 2000 transaction per second, and hits 56,000 transactions per second at peak. With 1MB blocks, Bitcoin can never rival payment card networks for daily usage.

That’s why BTC often runs into congestion, with transactions sometimes waiting hours to be confirmed. This causes transaction fees to skyrocket; in January 2018, it cost $20-40 to send a single BTC transaction. (Fees are paid to “miners”, who devote computing power to maintain the network). As recently as late May 2019, BTC transaction fees were approximately $4 – still far too high to act as a daily payments system. Not surprisingly, merchants stopped viewing BTC as a viable payment option, and consumers rarely use BTC to buy things.

This led to years of disputes. The Bitcoin Core development group would not raise the block cap; it wanted small blocks and to create separate “off-chain” payment channels (the Lightning Network), using the blockchain only as a settlement ledger. In contrast, Bitcoin purists call for increasing the block size to enable more transaction capacity, faster processing, and keep fees very low.

BSV is Scaling with Big Blocks to Create a Big Global Payment System

Because BTC got hijacked from Bitcoin’s original plan, Bitcoin SV (BSV) emerged in November 2018 to ensure the “Satoshi Vision” is fulfilled. BSV intends to massively scale to give big merchants and enterprises a payment network that is scalable, with throughput capacity that can support high-volume needs. While BTC keeps its tiny 1MB blocks, BSV began with a significantly larger block cap of 128 MB. Thus, BSV transactions are processed very fast and for very low fees. While BTC fees average around $4 per transaction now, BSV transactions now cost less than 1/5 of 1 cent. And we expect BSV transaction fees will drop even lower as block sizes get bigger and technology improves.

And BSV is already getting bigger capacity. On July 24, 2019, BSV’s network upgraded to a much bigger default block cap of 2 gigabytes (that’s 2000 megabytes). That’s right, BSV has a default block cap 2000 times bigger than BTC. After the July 2019 upgrade, BSV comfortably handles 1000+ transactions per second, and will continue increasing capacity. In theory, 2GB blocks could enable 9000-14,000 transactions per second (though that depends on technology improvements and the types of transactions, because BSV’s greater capacity supports many forms of data transactions, not just payments).

And in February 2020, BSV plans to entirely remove the block cap, and allow its capacity to grow into whatever the market needs. In fact, one of the leading BSV development teams (nChain) is working toward terabyte size blocks (1 million megabytes!) to process billions of transactions per block and 4 million transactions per second. That future means BSV can be the world’s public data ledger, recording payments and all kinds of other enterprise data transactions.

BSV Will Transform the Payments Industry

For merchants, BSV offers far lower transaction fees than today’s payment card systems, which charge 2-3% per transaction (plus base or monthly costs). For true peer-to-peer transactions (where a customer pays directly to a merchant’s Bitcoin wallet), the transaction fee paid by the customer can be a fraction of a cent. But most merchants will likely use a cryptocurrency payment processor– such as Coinify or White Pay from The White Company. Those options charge their own transaction fees for enabling merchants to accept BSV (and settle immediately in fiat currency if a merchant chooses). As BSV grows in usage, we expect those processing fees to dramatically reduce.

The greater efficiency will be for cross-border payments. Because BSV is a global system, foreign exchange costs will be minimized. For payment networks and merchants operating in multiple countries, BSV enables fast transfer across borders.

Speed is another benefit. With instant confirmations, merchants can quickly receive customers’ BSV, without waiting days for credit card payments to clear into a merchant account. Once a transaction is confirmed onto the blockchain, it is immutable, reducing risk of fraud and chargebacks. BSV teams are also working on solutions for safe instant transactions, so merchants feel comfortable accepting payments even before they are confirmed on the blockchain.

Finally, the BSV ecosystem focuses on ease of use. For too long, Bitcoin has lived among crypto hobbyists clinging to complicated practices. On BTC, the Lightning Network requires users to run their own node; but everyday consumers do not want to run a node just to pay merchants. In BSV, great mobile wallets like HandCash and Centbee make it easy to send Bitcoin – just knowing a person’s user handle or having a friend in your mobile phone contacts. BSV also has the groundbreaking Paymail protocol, allowing you to send BSV to an email address rather than clunky 26+ character Bitcoin wallet addresses. Payments need to be simple, and BSV understands this.

Over 10 years since the birth of Bitcoin, it is time to fully realize the vision for a new electronic cash system. That requires big blocks to create a big global payment network. This “Satoshi Vision” will only happen on Bitcoin SV.

That was the message Monday during a Twitter ask-me-anything (AMA) with the head of Square’s crypto team, Steve Lee.

The unit’s playful Twitter account fielded questions from its followers as well as crypto-community luminaries. With tweets signed simply “Steve,” it was Lee’s first set of public remarks on the team’s broad objectives since being hired in June.

Probably the single most illuminating moment of the AMA was this exchange:

The product we're focusing on is Bitcoin. It has been up and running for over 10 years… but there’s still a lot that needs to be done before we reach mass adoption. – Steve https://t.co/oU0yzhpWqX — Square Crypto (@sqcrypto) July 29, 2019

Many participants seemed to assume that Square Crypto had been built to improve how the payments company serves its existing crypto users. Square’s Cash App has been steadily earning more money on sales of bitcoin, bringing in $65.5 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2019 alone.

However, enhancing the Cash App’s crypto functionality is not the team’s focus, Lee said, as a tweet similar to the one above made even more clear:

You would have to ask Square. We are focused on open-source Bitcoin development. We do hope our work improves as many products and businesses as possible, including Square and its competitors. – Steve https://t.co/cLNCcVLGpT — Square Crypto (@sqcrypto) July 29, 2019

That said, Lee’s response to a question about supporting bitcoin core made it sound like the team has another vision for the best use of its resources:

Our process is design-centric. This may lead to consumer UI, infrastructure, and protocol development. Some projects may be accomplished in 3 months and others may take 3 years. All will be done in coordination with the rest of the open-source Bitcoin community. – Steve https://t.co/bAjgC5pcXh — Square Crypto (@sqcrypto) July 29, 2019

More on Square Crypto’s design sensibility has been shared on Medium.

Lee appears to be the team’s only hire so far. The Square Crypto account largely dodged questions about team size, but it did make clear that it’s close to bringing on another developer:

We’ve received more than 1,500 resumes and are blown away by how much interest there has been. I can say that we are very close to onboarding our first developer. We think the community will approve. – Steve https://t.co/ytAzD8bMJa — Square Crypto (@sqcrypto) July 29, 2019

One participant asked the account why the company wasn’t creating its own token, like so many companies in the last few years. Square Crypto responded by posting a tweet from the company’s founder:

Chinese importers in Russia are buying up to $30 million a day of tether (USDT) from Moscow’s over-the-counter trading desks.

They use the cryptocurrency to send large sums back to their home country, which has strict capital controls.

Previously the merchants used bitcoin for this, but when the market crashed in 2018 they switched to tether, which is designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar.

Despite longstanding questions about USDT’s collateral, in this market “nobody actually cares if tether is backed or not,” says one Moscow trader.

Vrrrrrrrrrrrrr…..

The cash-counting machines were softly buzzing in an office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Moscow’s landmarks.

“Hear that sound?” asked the head of an over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency trading desk — let’s call him ‘Oleg’ — who requested his real name and company be withheld. “You can hear it 24/7 in here.”

Business is brisk thanks to a constant flow of Chinese merchants who come in daily with heavy bags of cash. Oleg said his OTC desk sells about $3 million worth of crypto every day. Most of it usually goes to China. But what’s perhaps most surprising is which crypto.

Only 20 percent of Oleg’s sales are in bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization. The other 80 percent is in the dollar-pegged token known as tether, or USDT.

Tether’s best-known application is allowing crypto traders to move money between exchanges quickly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. But according to several Moscow OTC traders, it has at least one real-world use case – as the go-to remittance service for local Chinese importers.

The total volume of USDT purchased by Chinese businesses can reach $10 million to $30 million daily, these traders said.

“They accumulate a lot of cash in Moscow and need tether to transfer it to China,” said Maya Shakhnazarova, head of OTC trading at Huobi Russia, the Moscow office serving high-roller clients of Singapore-based exchange Huobi Global.

It’s a simple process.

“A client comes with cash, we register the price at exchanges, when we agree on a price, we make a deal,” Shakhnazarova told CoinDesk. “The client hands over cash and a wallet address, the seller sends USDT to the wallet.”

Why tether? It has the usual advantages of crypto – no limits on how much money can be sent or where – without the volatility that makes most coins infeasible for moving millions across the border daily.

Despite longstanding questions about USDT’s purported dollar backing, exacerbated by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) court case against the issuing company Tether, the stablecoin usually trades around $1.

The tether-for-rubles purchases often take place in offices like Huobi’s in the steel-and-glass skyscraper district of Moscow City.

“There are a lot of OTCs here in Moscow City, a bunch of offices in every building, and the volumes for them all can reach several dozens of millions of dollars a day. It’s all paid for in cash,” Shakhnazarova said.

Tether’s killer app

Chinese grey-market importers used to rely on bitcoin before the 2018 bear market, another OTC dealer, Roman Dobrynin, told CoinDesk. As the price was ever-growing, merchants and the intermediaries helping them buy crypto could make some extra money along the way.

But since the beginning of 2018, hoping that your bitcoin will still be worth the same or more at the end of the transfer became too risky.

“As the price was going down, tether became much more convenient to use,” said Dobrynin. “China is totally reliant on USDT, they trust in it a lot, plus it’s very liquid.” His own clients are mostly Chinese, and they usually find him by word of mouth, connecting via Telegram.

To buy or sell USDT for dollars from Tether itself, a trader must be verified through the company’s know-your-customer (KYC) process. However, since the token runs on top of public blockchain networks (bitcoin, ethereum and tron), anyone can receive or send it, and secondary trades are unrestricted.

Tether did not respond to requests for comment by press time.

Back in China, the merchants can exchange USDT for fiat easily, even though the People’s Bank of China banned fiat-to-crypto spot trading in September 2017, forcing the exchanges to move out of the country and limiting trading to crypto-to-crypto pairs.

Chinese traders who need to liquidate crypto assets into Chinese yuan can still go to an OTC market maker, such as those registered on exchanges like Huobi and OKEx, to get matched with buyers and send them crypto after receiving a wire transfer via a bank, AliPay or WeChat Pay.

Critics of Tether have long questioned whether the stablecoin was fully backed 1:1 with dollars, as the company long insisted. The NYAG case revealed that Tether had loaned a big chunk of its capital reserves to Bitfinex, an exchange with overlapping management and owners, leaving the coin only 74 percent collateralized by cash and equivalents.

None of this seems to faze the Moscow traders or their Chinese clients.

“Nobody actually cares if tether is backed or not,” says Konstantin Plavnik, chief operating officer of Moscow-based crypto derivatives exchange Xena. Confidence in Tether’s solvency relies on long-time habit and convenience: this market needs tether, so tether is trusted.

OTC traders also point out that USDT’s daily volume exceeds its supply in circulation several times over, which indicates that people turn the token around multiple times during the day. For example, according to CoinMarketCap, on July 29, the 24-hour volume of USDT was recorded at $17.5 billion, while the total supply was just around $4 billion.

The turnaround of tether is fast, so for the merchants using the token for remittances, whether it’s worth something or not matters only within one day. Large batches of USDT get transferred to China overnight and then exchanged for yuan, crypto entrepreneurs in Moscow told CoinDesk.

“USDT will stay propped by the power of habit and trust of its users,” said Vladislav Bulochnikov, the head of product at crypto wallet app provider Chatex. “Even if it loses half of its backing — it’ll still be out there.”

Skirting capital controls

Stepping back, the Chinese government maintains strict capital controls, limiting the amount of foreign currency anyone can buy or sell to $50,000 a year. People can apply for an additional quota, but still the amount of currency they can buy and sell will be limited. In this situation, some Chinese have opted to use crypto to move money across the border, Bloomberg reported in 2017.

The fact that Chinese merchants bringing cheap goods to Moscow’s shopping malls use crypto to move money around was all but officially recognized by the Russian authorities last year.

Several large malls in the city account for around $9.5 billion of unregulated cash flow monthly, and most of the merchants are from China, said Yuri Polupanov, the Bank of Russia’s head of financial monitoring and currency control, during an event hosted by Thomson Reuters in Moscow in April 2018.

These malls, located inside huge warehouses on the outskirts of Moscow, host multiple retail stands, selling mostly clothing, usually for cheap and for cash. They are shopping Meccas for people who can’t afford to spend much on their wardrobes and avoid even mass-market chain stores.

“We see most of the revenue turned into cryptocurrency, which is not reported in any way at the moment,” Polupanov said at the Thomson Reuters event, according to the RBK news agency. “We see simultaneous transfers of that cryptocurrency via email to the homeland of those merchants and producers, and the following exchange of it for the local currency there.”

According to a March 2019 report in the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, cash would be received at places like a hotel called “Druzhba” (“Friendship” in Russian), located next to the shopping mall named “Moscow.” Then this cash would be swapped for crypto and sent to Hong Kong.

The wholesale trade offices at Druzhba could be turning around $10 million to $12 million daily, Novaya Gazeta’s sources estimated.

The operations were ceased for a short time after police raided the hotel, along with the malls mentioned by the Bank of Russia, in March of this year.

Small crypto desks are still functioning at those malls, OTC trader Dobrynin believes, though they likely don’t provide the volumes merchants need.

Outside traders are often afraid to go to those areas to make deals as things can get dangerous there, he said, explaining:

“The personnel working there can sell somebody information about how much money you have, and some armed people can meet you on your way back. People go there only with armed bodyguards.”

The meeting, Prokopenya said, ended with Lukashenko asking him to propose regulations to boost the country’s tech sector. Prokopenya worked with IT firms and lawyers to draft guidelines to cash in on an emerging digital industry: cryptocurrencies.

Some two years later, the rules are in place. Investors can trade bitcoin on an exchange run by Prokopenya, while other companies are launching their own cryptocurrency platforms.

“The idea was to create everything from scratch,” Prokopenya told Reuters in an interview in London. “To make sure that it is free in some of the aspects it needs to be free, and very stringent in other aspects.”

Contacted for comment, Lukashenko’s office directed Reuters to an account of the meeting here on the president’s website.

Belarus is among a handful of smaller countries coming up with specific rule books for digital currencies. Their efforts could help shape the development of the global market and the growth of industry players, from exchange platforms to brokers.

So far, cryptocurrency companies have often had to choose between two extremes when deciding where to set up shop.

Major financial centers like London and New York, which apply traditional financial services rules to the sector, might be attractive to big institutions seeking safety but the compliance complexity and costs preclude many of the startups at the heart of the fledgling industry.

Conversely, lightly-regulated jurisdictions like the Seychelles and Belize allow far easier market access. But states with light rules can offer less protection for investors and have looser checks on money laundering, lawyers say.

The likes of Belarus and other newer entrants — including Bahrain, Malta and Gibraltar — are seeking to offer a third way: crafting specific rules for the cryptocurrency sector, betting they can attract companies by providing regulatory security as well as perks like tax breaks.

While there is no guarantee of success, cryptocurrencies represent a rare chance for these states or territories to grab a slice of an emerging market, potentially attracting investment and creating jobs, at a time when big financial hubs are adopting a more conservative, “wait-and-see” approach.

“There are jurisdictions in the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil camp,” said Jesse Overall, a lawyer at Clifford Chance in New York specializing in crypto regulation. “On the other end there is the U.S., UK, EU. In the middle, that’s the juicy part of the spectrum.”

Overall said both countries and companies could benefit from the emergence of frameworks specifically for cryptocurrencies. But states that get the rules wrong could fall foul of global rules to stamp out illicit use of digital coins, he added.

Indeed, there are major questions over whether these nations will be able to consistently prevent the hacks and illegal activities, such as money laundering, that plague the opaque sector and could hammer their reputations as secure centers.

Another risk of building rules for an unpredictable and rapidly evolving industry is that they could soon become outdated.

‘Carrots with no sticks’

ZPX, a Singapore-based crypto firm, will launch a cryptocurrency trading platform, Qume, next month catering to institutional investors such as high-frequency proprietary trading firms and hedge funds.

It has decided to base the business in Bahrain’s capital Manama — and the considerations it faced are emblematic of the quandary confronting many players across the industry.

ZPX’s CEO Ramani Ramachandran said it decided against operating in a so-called offshore jurisdiction with low or no regulation. Such a base could deter big investors as scrutiny of digital coins heats up from global regulators and politicians, he said.

“As the market matures analogous to traditional capital markets, mainstream institutional capital will increasingly look to come to regulated exchanges such as Qume as opposed to ‘light-touch’ venues in offshore jurisdictions.”

Bahrain launched rules in February for cryptocurrency companies such as trading platforms, including rigorous customer background checks, governance standards and controls on cyber security risks.

It’s also usually far cheaper in terms of compliance and administration costs to set up in smaller locations like Bahrain than in major financial hubs, said Ramachandran.

ZPX estimates such costs would come to around $200,000 a year in Bahrain, versus at least $750,000 a year in London.

Another advantage of setting up in a smaller country, said ZPX co-founder Aditya Mishra, was the close communication companies could have with regulators, something that would be difficult in a big financial center. Bahrain also offered good access to Gulf markets, he added.

Another cryptocurrency trading platform, iExchange, began operating in the Belarusian capital Minsk this month, aiming to attract investors from the CIS market of Russia and the former Soviet states.

Co-founder Igor Snizhko said Belarus was the best option because it had a regulatory framework that other countries in the region lacked.

Belarus demands audits of issuers of digital coins and details of the projects underpinning any issuance. For trading platforms, the rules include keeping tabs on suspicious transactions to meet international money laundering standards.

“For many the CIS market is very promising and very dangerous at the same time,” he added. “Many large and accomplished players are still afraid of one factor – a lack of transparency. We didn’t want to work in any ‘grey’ jurisdiction.”

Sweeteners offered by Belarus include tax breaks for companies mining or trading cryptocurrencies. The rules, described by PwC as “carrots with no sticks,” also give firms looser rules on currency controls and visas.

In the United States, by contrast, digital coin transactions are taxable. In Britain, capital gains taxes apply.

iExchange said it had also initially looked at other countries including Estonia and Malta, but chose Belarus because of its proximity to its target market.

Bespoke approach

The size of the global cryptocurrency sector is hard to gauge because of its complexity and lack of transparency. Still, Ireland-based Research and Markets reckons the sector will grow to $1.4 billion by 2024 from $1 billion this year. Other estimates see a faster rate of growth.

Crypto regulations vary through the world. While Facebook’s unveiling of its Libra coin has prompted signs of a coordinated backlash against cryptocurrencies by major economies, a patchwork of approaches still rules from country to country.

China has even banned cryptocurrencies outright, while an Indian government panel last week recommended a similar measure.

Sui Chung of Crypto Facilities, a London-based cryptocurrency futures exchange, said there were clear benefits to being in a major financial hub, including having access to highly skilled employees.

“You need to be in place where you can get the staff,” he said. “Our product teams, development teams have financial institution experience.”

Being regulated in an established center can also allow companies access to deeper, more liquid markets and provide greater certainty on securities law, said Ann Sofie Cloots, one of the authors of a Cambridge University study on cryptocurrency regulation.

“It may mean you have a more sophisticated investor base, greater access to capital,” she said. “It’s also a reputational thing.”

To be sure, it is not just the likes of Belarus and Bahrain that have coined their own crypto rules: Some larger countries like France and Japan have also made moves in that direction.

But it’s the smaller countries that have tended to launch the most sophisticated “bespoke” approaches, according to the Cambridge University study.

That could bring clarity to both cryptocurrency companies and related services like banks previously wary of the sector’s unclear legal status, said Cloots.

Belarus entrepreneur Prokopenya, whose Instagram posts of sports cars in Cyprus and beaches in Dubai are followed by 5.6 million people, acknowledged the risks that came with blockchain technology, including the potential for money laundering.

But he said these could be mitigated with clear regulation, and that countries like Belarus should not miss out on a chance to grab a slice of an emerging market.

“The biggest risks come from not taking any risks,” he said.

As reported earlier today, blockchain payments network Ripple has penned an open letter to United States regulators ahead of fresh hearings on cryptocurrency regulation this week, arguing that the country should develop an approach“ that does not disadvantage U.S. companies and classify cryptocurrencies “in a way that recognizes their fundamental differences — not painting them with a broad brush.”

The Iranian government has meanwhile followed through on the country’s Economic Commission’s move to authorize cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity, in what some have interpreted as being potentially the first step towards the domestic legalization of cryptocurrencies.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/open-letter-from-ripple-asks-us-govt-for-fair-crypto-regulation,"Blockchain payment network Ripple signed an open letter to United States regulators on July 28 ahead of fresh hearings on cryptocurrency regulation this week.

In the wake of mixed feelings from Congress on both Facebook’s Libra digital currency and crypto more broadly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appealed to Washington to be lenient in its future approach.

The letter, which follows other recent concerns from Garlinghouse, begins:

“Many in the blockchain and digital currency industry are responsible actors. We are responsible to U.S. and international law. We are responsible to serving the greater good.”

Ripple is the company behind the altcoin of the same name, XRP, used as a native token for its payment network and associated projects.

The network has seen interest from banks around the world, most of which are keen on cutting costs of international transactions in particular.

The company and its executives have meanwhile often found themselves at the center of controversy in the cryptocurrency world, due mainly to questions surrounding Ripple’s relationship to XRP and disputes over its decentralization.

In the letter, Garlinghouse appeared to continue that tone, unveiling rare praise of central banks and government monetary policy — something which Bitcoin (BTC) specifically was designed to counter.

He also mentioned trust as an essential component of a currency gaining wider acceptance. Bitcoin, based on mathematics, succeeded because it removed the need to trust any party involved in the transaction process. Garlinghouse continued:

“We don’t take for granted the vital role of central banks in issuing currencies and setting monetary policy in concert with the complex dynamics of economies around the world. For centuries, governments have been well suited for the job because paramount to the acceptance of any currency is trust.”

Concluding, Garlinghouse said the country was in the international spotlight over its response to the innovative sector:

“We urge you to support regulation that does not disadvantage U.S. companies using these technologies to innovate responsibly, and classifies digital currencies in a way that recognizes their fundamental differences — not painting them with a broad brush.”

As Cointelegraph reported, this week, U.S. lawmakers will again sit to debate cryptocurrency and blockchain policy. The dedicated hearing — “Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain” — is scheduled for Tuesday July 30.",,https://www.coindesk.com/200-year-old-passport-printing-firm-launches-hardware-crypto-wallet,"An Austrian printing company that has history going back to the early 1800s has launched a cryptocurrency storage device.

The new hardware wallet comes from YOUNIQX Identity, a subsidiary of the Vienna-based Austrian State Printing House (Oesterreichische Staatsdruckerei or OeSD) – a secure printing firm which is now the country’s high-tech passport maker and provider of other secure identity solutions.

Called Chainlock, the device is aimed to address the vulnerability of of “hot” or online wallets to hacking, which OeSD said in an announcement Monday “are a great security risk.”

The “100-percent offline” wallet offers private key generation in a (patent applied for) high-security enclave that OeSD said means the keys cannot be viewed by any outside party – even YOUNIQX or OeSD employees.

While the wallet can be managed via an app, it is secure from unauthorised access to private keys over the internet, WiFi and NFC, the firm claims. Further, crypto-stealing malware like CryptoLocker cannot access keys on the device.

Chainlock takes the form of a credit-card sized sliver of plastic that the firm said is resistant to water and heat.

Should blockchain-based tokens on the wallet be forked, owners of the card will benefit from the creation of new coins, it added.

While OeSD was traditionally a high tech paper printer, it has more recently moved into more high-tech identity and security offerings, some of which YOUNIQX was set up to develop. The innovation arm has already launched MICK (My Identity Check), a secure video identification service, and MIA (My Identity App), an integrated identity management platform.

Available via Coinfinity, some of the Chainlock wallet’s anti-fraud features are akin to those found on newer forms of passports or fiat currency, with micro-printing on both sides, hologram, a continuous colour gradient, tactile texturing and UV and infrared-visible patterns.

Priced at €59.99 (around $67) including VAT, the Chainlock wallet is currently available in bitcoin or ethereum options.

Bitcoin’s fee structure is different, as the user is afforded power to set transaction fees themselves, rather than the bank. If it’s easier, think of Bitcoin fees as “bids” that miners accept or reject.

If users set a high fee, Bitcoin miners are likely to confirm transfers relatively quickly, as they typically choose transactions by comparing their fees with others in the “mempool” (as well as a few other factors).

Select a fee too low, however, and miners are less likely to prioritize the payment, which can drag the transaction process out significantly.

TransferWise has become a standard alternative to international remittances via big banks. Unlike Bitcoin, this service has a million-dollar limit on money transfers, so already it’s rather useless for moving $468 million at once.

LOL >$39K AT AN AVERAGE BANK

Using TransferWise, it would cost more than $3,600 to send just $1 million from the US to the Eurozone, a fee that’s likely inflated by converting between currencies (because fiat is clumsy like that).

If we scale that cost to the amount of Bitcoin sent by today’s whale, we see that TransferWise would’ve charged $1,684,800 to send $468 million, as opposed to under $400.

And they say Bitcoin transactions are expensive…

Update 17:55 UTC, July 29: Since this article was published, it appears the same whale has continued to play around with their Bitcoin stash.

Twitter-based transaction monitor @whale_alert recently signalled three additional transfers, each one for roughly $450 million worth of Bitcoin. Every transfer’s recipient has been tagged with the same name: “Unknown Owner 26.”

Each transaction in this latest batch cost around $440 in fees. Many other (smaller) transfers sent from “Unknown Owner 26” were also detected recently.

Hey Bitcoin whale, if you’re out there.",2019-07-29,https://www.coindesk.com/circle-ceo-allaire-to-congress-treat-crypto-as-a-new-asset-class,"Crypto will take center stage on Capitol Hill for the second time in as many weeks when the U.S. Senate Banking Committee convenes Tuesday to discuss current and potential regulations.

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, will testify as a representative of the Blockchain Association trade group. He will be joined by University of California at Irvine School of Law professor Mehrsa Baradaran and Congressional Research Service specialist Rebecca Nelson.

The hearing is set to examine the regulatory questions around the industry and should be fairly broad, unlike the hearings on Facebook’s Libra project earlier this month.

“It’s going to be a discussion about the broader industry and what are the regulatory challenges and what can the U.S. be doing better, so I’m pretty optimistic,” said Kristin Smith, head of the Blockchain Association.

In his prepared remarks, Allaire calls for Congress to treat digital assets as its own asset class, as current regulatory burdens may make it difficult for U.S. companies to conduct business.

“Being a law-abiding U.S. citizen should not put U.S. companies, or U.S. industry, at a disadvantage in the development of this global technology,” he said in testimony published Monday, adding:

“Congress should adopt national policies that define and establish digital assets as a new asset class and develop appropriate rules and exemptions for digital assets. This will require legislation that likely changes our existing commodities, securities, and banking laws, among others.”

Allaire is representing the Blockchain Association because Circle knows these issues firsthand, Smith said. The company has secured a number of regulatory licenses and has restricted U.S. investors from trading certain assets but nevertheless had to lay off staff and move part of its business offshore due to the current regulatory structure.

Blockchain technology will help regulators better track attempts at money laundering, Allaire explains in his testimony.

Crypto vs. Libra

During the Libra hearings, lawmakers drew a distinction between cryptocurrencies in general and Facebook’s project specifically.

In his testimony for Tuesday, Allaire likewise contrasts Libra with USDC, the stablecoin jointly issued by his company and Coinbase through the Centre Consortium.

“Unlike Libra, which is attempting to establish a new global currency and unit of account, the CENTRE protocols provide a path for major reserve currencies to work as digital currencies,” he said.

CENTRE is also moving away from being based on any single blockchain (right now USDC is built on top of ethereum), he said.

In her prepared testimony, Nelson also contrasted Libra with cryptocurrencies in general, focusing on privacy as one example.

“The libra also upends the debate about privacy and cryptocurrency,” she said, explaining that while previous concerns around crypto users centered around whether they “had too much privacy,” the issue with Libra is the opposite.

“Previously, concerns about privacy in cryptocurrency markets focused on whether users had too much privacy: that by partially shielding user identities, cryptocurrencies allowed bad actors to engage in nefarious and illegal activities,” she said, adding:

“In [contrast], concerns focus on how users’ data on financial transactions would be protected, and not merged with user data from other Facebook platforms. Although the head of Calibra has pledged that ensuring privacy is a top priority, many analysts are more skeptical given previous scandals involving Facebook’s use of user data and the dependence of Facebook’s business model on collecting and monetizing user data.”

It’s unclear if Facebook will come up during Tuesday’s hearing, but Smith said it’s likely there may be questions about consumer privacy and how different systems might tackle that issue.

“I think it should be a fairly well-rounded discussion,” Smith said. “I don’t think we’re going to hear anything new that we haven’t heard before, I just think it’s going to be a more thoughtful and measured conversation than we’ve heard with the Facebook hearing.”

Financial inclusion

While Allaire calls for specific legislative action, his fellow expert witnesses take more of an educational tone. Nelson, in particular, notes that her testimony examines international regulatory structures, “as requested.”

“Digital currencies may have the potential to be adopted more widely, as central banks and large [multinational corporations] look to create their own digital currencies,” she said, adding:

“Large-scale adoption of digital currencies could have a range of policy implications for the United States, including financial stability, consumer protections, AML/CFT, privacy considerations, and sanctions policy, among others.”

Law professor Baradaran’s testimony focuses more on the financial system as it exists today and its impact on unbanked and underbanked populations. Her remarks suggest she is skeptical that private citizens or companies developing cryptocurrencies to tackle these issues is the best course of action.

“There are inequalities and problems in the U.S. banking system and they must be fixed, but they must be fixed through democratic means. Cryptocurrencies want to take over where our public institutions have failed,” Baradaran says.

While Congress should take note of the crypto industry’s criticism, Baradaran concludes that it is up to Congress to act to “foster financial inclusion.”

Blockchain, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency wallet platforms, says it's launched a digital currency exchange aimed at delivering ""lightning-fast"" trades. The company's exchange, called The PIT, is the result of a behind-the-scenes effort led by a team of former executives from the New York Stock Exchange, TD Ameritrade, Google and Goldman Sachs. According to Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, the new exchange's matching engine Mercury can execute buy or sell orders in ""40 to 50 microseconds,"" an ""order of magnitude faster than other market players"" like Coinbase and Binance. Founded in 2011, Blockchain initially started out with what's known as a block explorer — kind of like an internet browser for cryptocurrency data — and then built digital wallets for users to store and exchange their crypto. It derives its name from the eponymous blockchain network that records bitcoin transactions.

Having enjoyed popularity with bitcoin enthusiasts — Blockchain claims to account for about 25% of daily activity on the bitcoin network — the company is hoping its exchange platform will help lure in the uninitiated. ""There's a huge audience of people who have not yet placed their first bitcoin trade,"" Nicole Sherrod, head of trading products at Blockchain, told CNBC in an interview. Sherrod previously led the active trading product team at online stock broker TD Ameritrade before joining Blockchain. Sherrod said the new trading platform would give investors a degree of liquidity not seen in competitor exchanges. ""In volatile markets in particular, speed is of utmost importance,"" she said. ""I would not feel comfortable delivering a platform to retail investors that puts them in a position where they couldn't get in and out of a trade with lightning-fast speed.""

Blockchain CEO Peter Smith says the cryptocurrency firm's new exchange can executive order in a matter of ""microseconds."" Blockchain

Cryptocurrencies have gained a reputation for their volatile price swings. Bitcoin in late 2017 skyrocketed to a near-$20,000 record high, before plummeting the following year to as low as $3,122. The world's best-known digital currency has been on the rise this year, however, last trading at $9,502. Bitcoin's rise in 2019 was attributed in part to Facebook's plans to create a cryptocurrency, with analysts saying it brings some much-needed credibility to cryptocurrencies. Facebook's Libra project has been panned by regulators, however, concerned by the risks it may pose to consumers. One big hurdle for the industry to overcome is bringing institutional investors with deep pockets on board. That may be slowly starting to happen, with financial services giant Fidelity signaling it's warming to the space. Sherrod said that Blockchain's crypto exchange is providing liquidity through ""institutional-level market makers.""",2019-07-30,https://news.bitcoin.com/blockchain-com-launches-high-speed-crypto-exchange-for-retail-traders/,"Blockchain.com Launches High Speed Crypto Exchange for Retail Traders

Cryptocurrency investors looking for a trading platform focused on high speed performance just got a brand new option, available from launch in over 240 markets around the world, including a select number of U.S. states. Popular wallet provider Blockchain.com is launching The Pit.

Institutional-Grade Platform for Retail Investors

Blockchain.com, the well-known provider of cryptocurrency products with over 40 million wallets created to date, has announced it is launching a new microsecond-latency crypto exchange called The Pit. The institutional-grade platform will be available from launch in over 240 markets around the world, including a select number of U.S. states.

The new service is focused on speed, and the company says that after extensive R&D its custom “Mercury” matching engine now delivers faster execution than any other crypto exchange. It is also hosted in one of the fastest and most reliable low-latency data centers in the world (Equinix LD4), promising to offer reliability and performance regardless of market conditions. Additionally, a feature called Blockchain Connect will allow the company’s many wallet users to transfer funds directly to and from their Pit account, all while managing their digital assets through a single provider.

Addressing another concern that many investors have in various markets around the world, the company assures traders that it will never trade against its clients or give itself superior access to the market. “The current crypto exchange market is outdated, broken, and skewed against users. We got tired of waiting for a new entrant to deliver the performance today’s traders demand,” explained Peter Smith, Blockchain CEO. “We decided to take matters into our own hands, and built an exchange that puts users first, including the 40M wallets on our platform.”

The new exchange will launch with a global banking network to facilitate deposits, withdrawals, and fiat-to-crypto trading in USD, EUR, and GBP. It will feature bitcoin cash (BCH) as a core asset at launch, alongside additional initial cryptos such as BTC, ETH, and LTC, as well as stablecoins such as USDT, and PAX, for a total of 26 trading pairs. The company also plans to rapidly add additional tokens, pairs, and products in the near term.

The trading venue will launch with the support of a diverse group of market markers backed by a deep lending pool. “This project has been developed by an accomplished team with demonstrated experience in managing one of the largest userbases of crypto traders. The crypto ecosystem needs more exchanges that are striving for institutional-grade architecture, decreased latency, and more robust liquidity. We look forward to playing our part in developing The PIT into one of the leading trading venues,” commented Cristian Gil, Co-Founder of GSR, one of the global market makers on the platform.

All users will have to be at least Silver Tier KYC to trade at The Pit, which requires providing a legal name, verified email, date of birth, and address. Gold Tier KYC requires a photo of a government issued ID and of the applicant, but opens up higher trading amounts and features on both the wallet and the exchange.

Built by a Well Experienced Pit Crew

The CEO of the company has revealed that the new platform was developed in secrecy over the past year by a dedicated new group of employees inside Blockchain.com. This stealth team was joined by veterans from finance and technology firms such as NYSE, TD Ameritrade, E*Trade, Google, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Interactive Brokers and Revolut. “We’re incredibly lucky to have assembled a world class team who have been heads-down building The PIT for the past year. The ‘PIT Crew’ as we call them, has an unmatched level of technical skills and the domain expertise required to develop a product of this caliber,” stated Smith.

Nicole Sherrod, the firm’s previously unannounced Head of Retail Products, joined last July to lead product development of the trading platform. She previously led the active trading product division at online brokerage giant TD Ameritrade. “I’ve dedicated my career to championing the retail investor and giving them a powerful trading experience that is not only fair, but provides an edge,” explained Sherrod. “When Peter approached me with his vision for The PIT, I realized this was an even greater impact on retail crypto traders everywhere.”

Tom Haller, previously the Chief Software Architect for trading systems at the New York Stock Exchange, led the development of the exchange’s matching engine. “Whereas most cryptocurrency exchanges run alongside slow, consumer applications in the cloud, The PIT leverages best practices from Wall Street to facilitate rapid, efficient, and high-quality trade execution at HFT [high-frequency trading] speeds,” commented Haller.

Bitcoin Cash-Friendly Company

Blockchain.com is one of the most trusted companies in the digital assets space, and has raised over $70 million in funding from investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners and Google Ventures. It is also known for being friendly to the BCH community, integrating the cryptocurrency into its services. Earlier this year, for example, the company launched a Bitcoin Cash block explorer that allows users to search for detailed information on specific BCH blocks, check whether a transaction has confirmed, view the balance of a wallet address, monitor market prices, and even watch real-time network transactions.

In January of this year, the wallet provider also created an educational tool called Blockchain Primers. The service is intended to offer a relatively concise overview of each crypto asset including background material, the latest market data and analysis. The first report issued on it was an introduction to BCH, whose advantages over BTC, according to the research, include greater maximum onchain transaction capacity, lower average transaction fees, and additional smart contract functionality.

After extensive research and development over the span of a year, Blockchain said its “Mercury” matching engine delivers speeds a quantum faster than any other crypto exchange.

A stealth team inside the company composed of veterans from the New York Stock Exchange, TD Ameritrade, Google, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Interactive Brokers and Revolut built The PIT with the goal of executing trades at high speeds, Blockchain said in a statement.

“What happens at these exchanges when there’s a volatility spike, the matching engines get overwhelmed and they just shut down and people can’t even trade,” Nicole Sherrod, head of trading products at Blockhain told Reuters in a phone interview.

“Our clients can do trades in microseconds in a category where other exchanges are doing them in milliseconds,” she added.

Crytocurrencies are back in the spotlight in the midst of a steep price rally and high volatility this year, led by bitcoin, which has soared nearly 160% so far in 2019. After hitting an 18-month high just shy of $14,000 in late June, bitcoin has dropped nearly 30% and last traded at $9,528 BTC=BTSP.

On Tuesday, Sherrod said customers will be able to open accounts at The PIT, with the exchange initially launching the trading of the bitcoin/U.S. dollar pair on Aug. 6.

The exchange is available to users in more than 200 countries, and will begin with 26 trading pairs and a global banking network to facilitate deposits, withdrawals, and fiat-to-crypto trading in U.S. dollar, euro, and sterling. Initial assets include bitcoin, ether, litecoin, tether, and PAX tokens.

Tom Haller, previously the chief software architect for trading systems at the New York Stock Exchange, led the development of the exchange’s matching engine, Blockchain said.

In a juicy little chunk of news from the Redditsphere, a user claiming to be a former IRS employee has called the agency’s new crypto compliance letters “broad and very error-prone fishing expeditions.” The throwaway account details the “really bad data” used by the agency, saying they’re operating mostly from guesswork, casting broad nets and leveraging fear to generate revenue. Internal reports from the group itself lament a lack of staff, funding, and tech know-how. A former auditor’s experience attests to the chaos and implications, affirming that the IRS may be little more than a poorly run “fishing” scam of massive proportions.

Ineptitude Reigns Supreme

The agency famous for long lines and severely understaffed offices, “courtesy disconnects” on the phone, and outdated, enragingly tedious filing procedures is now subject to even further criticism: how in the hell could they possibly deal with a fast-paced technology like crypto, when they can’t even process fiat taxes efficiently? Well, they’re trying, via a new letter campaign launched in June, warning crypto holders suspected of misfiling that they mean business.

Reddit user and self-proclaimed former IRS employee u/IRS_throwaway_BT states: “It strikes me that this [cryptocurrency] letter writing campaign in particular is very unethical, as they’re blindly scaring thousands of people shitless who very well may have done absolutely nothing wrong. Many of these people will seek legal or professional tax help at a large cost to them … In a fair world they’d [the IRS] face a class action lawsuit for this predatory behavior.”

While some will object here with dusty maxims about everyone having to pay their “fair share,” u/IRS_throwaway_BT is merely pointing out the dangerous guesswork ostensibly being employed in issuing the letters:

They’re not really sure if you owe more money or not since they have really bad data. They are almost certainly joining up some of their internal tax filing database tables with external datasets (probably coinbase) and trying to estimate how much they think you owe.

The above prospect is problematic because some individuals might be counting losses from platforms or exchanges the IRS doesn’t know about, triggering warnings. u/IRS_throwaway_BT claims they’ve been part of previous “letter writing campaigns” and that the agency is dysfunctional where organization of data is concerned:

“For example the coinbase data might have shown that you sold $20K worth of BTC in 2014 but your tax filings only show that you paid taxes on approximately $5K. And that could be because you had a $15K loss on Bitfinex but the IRS doesn’t know that … It just *appears* from their incomplete picture that you might owe more than they see that you’ve paid. For the people that actually didn’t pay or underpaid, they’re trying to scare you into paying what you actually do owe.”

A Pretty Penny for Crypto Help

Commenters on the thread happily joined the venting after u/IRS_throwaway_BT opened the floor for catharsis and commiseration via the post. Since most professional tax accountants and advisors are still clueless when it comes to crypto, it can cost a lot to hire one of the rare firms that can help. One user lamented the steep prices of such services in San Francisco:

Another user wrote:

I have paid 100k’s in taxes on crypto profits over the years. These scare tactics make me want to move to puerto rico 6 months of the year … because i hate playing a guessing game … and spending over a week working on this per year while i am constantly presumed to be guilty.

Being presumed guilty is never a good feeling, and none of this is to mention that if these traders wish to retain their privacy they’ll have to avoid centralized, KYC exchanges like Coinbase anyway. This only makes them more suspect to the IRS, presumably. Because professional crypto accountants want official spreadsheets from these groups, privacy becomes problematic; doing the calculations independently, though, could conversely carry the risk of raising IRS red flags.

Whistleblowers on Both Sides

The Reddit comments are thought-provoking, relatable, and funny. But there’s no way to prove u/IRS_throwaway_BT actually is a former IRS employee (although they did agree to supply evidence in the comments, as long as doxxing was guaranteed not to be an issue). Still, the question remains: are things as much of a clusterfuck of ineptitude as claimed? Is the IRS really issuing threats on bad info, incomplete info, or no info at all? At least one verified, former IRS auditor seems to agree.

Former agent Sherry Peel Jackson found out the hard way about IRS chaos, when the group turned their sights on her. She was slapped with a four-year prison sentence in 2008 for willful failure to file. The former Certified Fraud Examiner stopped paying income tax after being unable to find specific legislation mandating it. According to Jackson, nobody she asked could tell her. In her closing remarks at the 2002 Citizen’s Truth-In-Taxation Hearing she stated:

In my tenure as an IRS agent, I personally saw marriages broken, families torn apart, homes confiscated and businesses destroyed – all while my colleagues and I were out making unjust demands on the American people – without the proper authority. Now, you be the judge.

Whatever one’s views about the legality, none of this bodes well for the IRS’ organizational and people skills, considering they can’t even tell Americans why they’re being taxed, and that they literally cage those who so much as ask.

Not to be outdone by activists like Jackson, however, the IRS has “whistleblowers” of its own. The agency has a standing offer involving turning people in for a reward of up to 30% of their additional taxes and penalties. Incentivizing Orwellian surveillance like this may seem shocking to some, but it shouldn’t be unexpected. In view of the perpetual struggles of the agency, this dirty, mafia-like “outsourcing” makes complete sense.

No Staff? No Budget? No Problem!

Back in January America’s best-loved collection agency was fresh off a painful government shutdown. Over half its workforce had been grinding on wearily without pay for some time already, and the group was understaffed and inundated, with over five million pieces of unprocessed mail — not to mention 87,000 amended tax returns to manually sift through. According to a 2018 IRS Advisory Council Report taking aim at significant budget cuts to the agency:

The draconian cuts to the IRS budget have meant less of everything from personnel to training to taxpayer assistance to enforcement activities to compliance to systems modernization and, ultimately, to tax revenue.

So there, from the horse’s mouth, it’s finally laid bare: We don’t have enough extorted funds to hire and train people to help extort you and teach you to comply, or fund violent enforcement to extort in the fashion we please. We cannot keep up with modern technology, and thus are unable to make money for ourselves. As such, we deserve your pity and more of your extorted funds.

Why Some Bitcoiners Are Nervous

If the claims of u/IRS_throwaway_BT are correct, and there truly are “maybe 5 people part time” running the new crypto assets letter campaign, it’s hard to imagine there’s much of a threat to the average, low-volume trader. Some, including the poster, are saying it’s mainly high profile, big fish receiving letters now. That’s the rub, though. With the IRS, when someone gets hooked (regardless of legal compliance or not), they get hooked hard, and the group puts the proverbial head of their decapitated financial, social, and professional life on a spit for all to see. “Make a mistake in giving us your money, and the same can happen to you.”

The new film is expected to focus on several leading names from the crypto and blockchain space.

Enthusiasts believe this is an excellent opportunity to increase awareness and encourage adoption. This, they hope, will reflect in the price of cryptocurrencies.

The streaming giant became the first to document blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies on film in 2016 when it launched “Banking on Bitcoin“. The documentary focused on Bitcoin and its history, with a heavy focus on incidents and fraud. Still, it’s a useful resource for people who want to learn more about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.

Pop culture’s shift to crypto

Netflix was the first to make a documentary on cryptocurrency, but it’s not the only one looking to familiarise the public with digital coins.

Since Bitcoin hit the spotlight, many artists and filmmakers have tried to introduce cryptocurrency to the public. From songs and documentaries to some of the most popular series running on television, Bitcoin seems to be gaining exposure – much to the delight of the crypto community.

Mentions in popular culture aren’t always accurate, however, and many producers continue to associate digital currencies with cybercrime.

Here are five times cryptocurrencies have featured in pop culture.

1) The Simpsons

The Simpsons mentioned Bitcoin for the first time back in 2013, which is long before the Netflix cryptocurrency film. This series is known as being a barometer for American culture, so the Bitcoin mention indicates that the population had some knowledge of the digital currency as far back as 2013.

In the “Clown in the Dumps” episode, Krusty the Klown blames his bad luck on the Bitcoin markets for being broke. Later on, the show mentioned Bitcoin again. In another episode, there’s a billboard saying “Send me your lunch money online! – Accepting Bitcoin”. The reference is a joke, but it highlights how widespread Bitcoin had already become.

2) The Big Bang Theory

This popular series had an entire episode built around Bitcoin in season 11. At that time, Bitcoin had reached the $10,000 milestone, and the filmmakers decided to dedicate 19 prime-time minutes to digital coins.

After the first wave of enthusiasm from the crypto community, people started to notice too many misconceptions in the episode. It was pretty obvious that producers didn’t have a clue about what Bitcoin was and how it worked. Almost all the facts in the show were erroneous in real life.

3) Grey’s Anatomy

Bitcoin made it to the Grey Sloan Medical Hospital as well. In 2017, the winter finale of the most popular medical drama in history brought ransomware and Bitcoin to a large public audience.

The episode saw the hospital dealing with a cyber-attack, with screens showing “We own your servers. We own your systems. We own your patients’ medical records”. The attackers requested 4,932 Bitcoin (about $20 million when the episode was shot, almost $47 million at the moment).

4) Family Guy

This is yet another Bitcoin allusion that shows how little people actually know about cryptocurrency outside the crypto world. Still, it brings Bitcoin in front of people of all ages and backgrounds, making it start to become a part of our everyday lives.

In season 14, Peter Griffin suggests Bitcoin could be the solution to his family’s financial problems. The statement is wrong in so many ways. People who learn about Bitcoin from TV may be lured into believing that cryptocurrency is a safe investment, regardless of their knowledge or spending habits. With the rampant volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, nothing could be further from the truth.

5) Silicon Valley

Season 5 of Silicon Valley focused on cryptocurrency, ICOs, and the benefits of Bitcoin. Gilfoyle’s PowerPoint explaining cryptocurrency might be one of the most accurate ever to go live on television.

This time, people at home got access to more accurate details about cryptocurrency and how it can disrupt traditional payment systems.

Netflix and cryptocurrency: Changing minds on Bitcoin?

Going back to Netflix and cryptocurrency, the new documentary about altcoins could do more than all these inaccurate mentions put together. The producers have interviewed an impressive list of names for this documentary.

Speculators are saying that the film will include people like Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Bitmain founder Jihan Wu, and NEO co-founder Da Hongfei, among other names in the crypto industry.

If these rumours are correct, the documentary will be enlightening and might change the way people see Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. It’s going to show the world that there’s more to it than cybercrime, scams, and the possibility of getting rich overnight.",2019-07-30 16:00:32+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/golden-cross-provides-glimmer-of-hope-for-bitcoin-price-revival,"View

Bitcoin’s three-day chart is reporting a golden cross, a long-term bull market indicator, for the first time since February 2016. A similar crossover seen six months ahead of the August 2016 mining reward halving paved way for a mega bull run.

History may repeat itself with mining reward halving due in less than 12 months.

BTC may rise back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours or so with short duration charts signaling seller exhaustion.

A UTC close above $11,120 is needed to revive the bullish view. On the downside, key support is seen at $9,049 (July 17 low).

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bulls have reason to be optimistic despite the recent 33 percent price drop, as a long-term technical indicator has turned bullish.

The 50-candle price average has crossed above the 200-candle average on the three-day chart, confirming a golden cross – a bull market indicator. That is the first such crossover on the three-day chart since Feb. 3, 2016, according to Bitstamp data.

That long-term moving average crossovers are lagging indicators and have limited predictive powers at best is widely known. So, seasoned traders may consider the latest cross as a product of BTC’s rally from December’s low of $3,122 to June’s high of $13,880. After all, MAs follow price and, the longer the time-frame of the MA, the bigger the lag.

Even so, the bulls can take heart from the golden cross, which has proved its mettle as a reliable indicator in the past, as discussed earlier this month.

Golden crosses 2016 and 2019

Bitcoin witnessed a golden cross in the three days to Feb. 3, 2016 – six months ahead of the mining reward halving – following which the cryptocurrency charted its way to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.

With another reward halving (effectively, a supply cut) due in less than 12 months, history may just repeat itself.

As of writing , BTC is changing hands at $9,500 on Bitstamp, down 31.55 percent from June’s high of $13,880. The cryptocurrency could rise to $10,000 in the next 24 hours, according to the short-duration technical charts.

4-hour chart

The long-tailed doji seen on the 4-hour chart reflects the fact that sellers failed to keep prices at lows near $9,100 on July 28, with buyers pushing prices all the way back to $9,500.

The candle widely considered a sign of seller exhaustion, more so since it has appeared following a more than 30-percent decline from June’s high of $13,880.

Daily chart

A bearish lower-highs pattern, as represented by the falling trendline, is intact. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are also trending south.

The 14-day relative strength index is reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print. The indicator, however, is now flatlining, indicating a weakening of bearish momentum.

More importantly, dips to or below $9,400 have been consistently short-lived since July 16, also a sign of seller exhaustion.

As a result, a rise back to $10,000 in the next 24 hours cannot be ruled out. That said, a bull revival would require a UTC close above the bearish lower high of $11,120 created on July 20.

But before Libra can reach the market, it has a mountain of regulatory hurdles to pass in dozens of countries. And so far, regulators’ reactions to Facebook’s bold invention are so bleak that even the tech company itself is starting to question the viability of the this project.

In a disclosure section in its latest quarterly report, Facebook warned that the mounting legislative opposition it had faced since the introduction of Libra could mean that cryptocurrency may never see the light of day.

“Libra is based on relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding digital currency are uncertain and evolving. Libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue,” Facebook said in the SEC filing.

“In many jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital currency,” the company further explained. “These laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the launch of the Libra currency… In addition, market acceptance of such currency is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, there can be no assurance that Libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all.”

From the governmental conversations that have taken place so far, lawmakers’ main concern with Libra is its easy access to Facebook’s existing 2.4 billion-people user base, which could create a haven for cross-border money laundering and other crimes.

“We think you’re a bank, but you’re not quite like a bank. If you’re bank, we regulate the heck out of you. That is the resistance you’re feeling,” Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.) said to David Marcus, Facebook’s crypto project head, at a congressional hearing earlier this month.

In response, Facebook argued that Libra will be subject to an independent supervising board called Libra Association. The entity is comprised of reputable financial institutions and companies including Visa, Mastercard, Uber, PayPal, Stripe, Booking.com and Facebook itself.

Marcus also contended that the vast amount of user information generated through Libra could be useful for law enforcement and implied that the government could access Facebook’s information if needed.",2019-07-30 20:50:27+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/live-crypto-blockchain-hearing-at-us-senate-banking-committee,"During today’s United State Senate Banking Committee hearing on the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain, Cointelegraph will be updating live with the most important developments.

The July 30 hearing, titled “Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain,” follows the previous hearings in mid-July that examined the regulatory hurdles surrounding Facebook’s Libra.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire will be a witness today in front of the Senate Committee on Banking, House, and Urban Affairs on behalf of The Blockchain Association, along with Rebecca M. Nelson, a specialist in international trade and finance, and Mehrsa Baradaran, a professor of law at University of California, Irvine School of Law.

For more detailed information on the witnesses, Cointelegraph has a dedicated analysis here.

11:25 a.m. EST

Crapo: I want the U.S. to stay at the forefront of this technology, which both has incredible potential and incredible risk.

11:22 a.m. EST

Nelson: Facebook has changed the debate about cryptocurrencies

11:15 a.m. EST

Barabadan sees similarities in the resistance of tech companies to regulation in the same way that big banks are resistant to regulation.

11:16 a.m. EST

Brown asks what lessons we can apply to tech companies after the 2008 financial crash, and Barabadan says that there is a fear that the U.S. will lose its tech edge if it doesn’t let these companies grow unfettered.

11:13 a.m. EST

Brown: “If there aren’t really new products, why would we need rules and regulations?”—Brown going off the idea that the ideas are the same for financial instruments, just new technology backing them.

11:10 a.m. EST

Crapo: how does Libra gain global acceptance if it’s facing every country’s different regulatory climate?

Allaire: some of these cryptocurrencies are just open source software that exists on the internet and runs everywhere the internet exists (“even interstellar”).

Allaire: “Digital money will move frictionlessly, everywhere in the world, at the speed of the internet, hopefully with a high level of security and data protection.”

11:08 a.m. EST

Allaire notes that there are larger opportunities for digital assets and blockchains outside of the United States. When looking for locations, Circle wants a high bar from a regulatory perspective, from a custody risk in particular, as well as clear definitions.

11:04 a.m. EST

U.S. Senator Jon Tester of Montana appears concerned about Libra being compromised the same way that a credit or debit card can be.

“Would it kill cryptocurrency in the laws that we are probably going to be passing […] if we stipulated that it had to be a 1:1?”

11:02 a.m. EST

Nelson brings up money laundering as a big concern for cryptocurrencies around the globe, but says that some licensing, reporting, and transparency requirements can help with these concerns.

11:01 a.m. EST

Nelson thinks that some crypto hubs are using regulation as a way to attract crypto to their borders, using clarity and certainty to bring people in to their jurisdictions.

10:58 a.m. EST

U.S. Senator Christopher J. Van Hollen of Maryland on real-time settlement: “Our failure to have moved forward with this technology […] is costing millions of Americans, billions of dollars every day.”

10:56 a.m. EST

Cortez Masto asked Baradaran why digital currencies cannot bank the unbanked. She responds that the problem is that these people live in “banking deserts.”

Baradaran: “How does any digital-based currency help when people are operating in cash?”

10:53 a.m. EST

U.S. Senator Catherine Marie Cortez Masto of Nevada believes in the potential of blockchain, and the importance of leading in this technology over China.

10:51 a.m. EST

Schatz: “I don’t doubt the potential for this tech, I just don’t think that it’s going to actually bank low-income communities, and I don’t think you’ve persuaded anybody here that it’s going to do so.”

10:49. a.m. EST

Schatz keeps bringing up the idea that not everyone has a smartphone, and so it’s hard to place bets on this technology to solve all of our problems and “leap over all existing ones.”

Allaire rebuts by saying that technological innovation can be slow, comparing now to the beginning of the internet, of the slow implementation of broadband.

10:48 a.m. EST

U.S. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii asks if we are anywhere close to democratizing the use of technological products, following up on the overall financial inequality topic.

Schatz: “What it sounds like to me is tech people wanting to wave a wand and skip a bunch of steps and avoid the tough political of doing things for people.”

10:42 a.m. EST

U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is asking about the literal meaning of the 1:1 backing of the Libra.

Allaire comments that while the first wave of these types of digital currencies were focused on establishing a global digital currency, the critical mainstream use cases for the financial services sector has needed the development of stable coins, with Libra as an example.

Allaire now brings up the Circle consortium’s USD Coin as another example.

Warner responds by asking: if there is a basket of currencies backing the Libra, doesn’t that create currency risk?

Warner: “If you have a 100% reserve, where is Libra going to make money on this?”

10:36 a.m. EST

Baradaran is now speaking about the ways that people have tried to bank the unbanked and how those past attempts have failed, aligning those past failures with some of the stated goals of cryptocurrencies.

Baradaran admits that while blockchain is “amazing,” the hearing is about digital assets and the blockchain, and what is really going on in these markets. She repeats that the problems of the unbanked are policy problems, not technological.

10:34 a.m. EST

Allaire notes that we should regulate digital assets, but that we need new definitions of them as an asset class.

10:31 a.m. EST

Allaire: “Regulations around the custody of assets is a really critical need.”

Crapo then brings up Poloniex moving to Bermuda, and Allaire says that there is a big problem for digital assets fitting into definitions in our current financial systems.

“Unfortunately, in the United States, the guidance that the SEC has given is extremely, let’s just say, narrow, in terms of what they deem to not be a security.”

10:29 a.m. EST

Professor Mehrst Baradaran: “There is yet to be an innovative technology that has eliminated the risks and frauds and crimes that regulation is meant to combat.”

Moving to the blockchain doesn’t protect from these risks, in Baradaran’s opinion.

10:23 a.m. EST

Professor Mehrst Baradaran believes it’s natural that people have embraced Bitcoin in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

However, she adds that the current problems in our economy are issues of policy, not of technology, so blockchain is not necessarily the answer. According to Baradaran, we already have a public ledger, it’s called the Federal Reserve.

10:22 a.m. EST:

Dr. Rebecca M. Nelson thinks Facebook could be a game changer for cryptocurrencies, but it has raised both regulatory and systemic concerns before it can be implemented.

10:18 a.m. EST:

Allaire thinks that current restrictive atmosphere has led companies to domicile overseas, rather than in the U.S, and that Congress should define digital assets as a new asset class.

Allaire: “We are in the process of moving our international facing services and products out of the United States.”

10:15 a.m. EST:

Jeremey Allaire speaks about his views on the troubles of our current financial system, including cybercriminals, hostile nations, and a lack of equal access.

Allaire: “There absolutely can be a better future ahead, one built on digital assets and blockchains.”

10 a.m. EST:

Senator Michael Crapo of Idaho: These technologies are inevitable, they could be beneficial, and the United States should lead in this sector.

Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio: “Facebook has proved over and over […] that they can not be trusted. But they don’t care. They move fast, they break things. Minor things, like our political discourse and journalisms and relationships and privacy. Now they want to break our currency and payment systems, hiding behind the phrase ‘innovation.”’",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-launches-switzerlands-first-integrated-trading-and-custody-platform,"Swiss integrated cryptocurrency exchange Smart Valor has launched trading of four fiat currencies with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

Switzerland sees another crypto first

As a blog post issued July 30 confirmed, Smart Valor, which combines exchange with custody and brokerage features, will continue to add new currencies on a monthly basis.

The company is headquartered in the town of Zug, home of Switzerland’s Crypto Valley Association, and represents the first integrated exchange provider to launch in the country.

“After 18 months of development, we are excited to go live with a core element of the SMART VALOR Platform — the exchange,” CEO Olga Feldmeier commented in the blog post.

She added:

“This brings us a huge step forward to our vision of becoming the world’s first security token exchange for alternative investments.”

The initial pairs on offer for BTC and ETH are the Swiss franc, British pound sterling, euro and U.S. dollar. In future, pending receipt of the requisite license from Swiss authorities, Smart Valor will offer security tokens.

“The roadmap for the next 6 months also includes long-term deposit of fiat money, CHF-based stable coin as well as trading and staking of exchange’s native cryptocurrency currency VALOR,” the blog post added.

Crypto Valley turns up the heat

The launch comes amid rapid progress for other Crypto Valley members.

As Cointelegraph reported, finance app Aximetria gained a nationally-recognized Anti-Money Laundering license this week, while broker Bitcoin Suisse previous revealed it had applied for permission to act as a banking and securities dealer.

India’s finance minister has broken silence and talked about the crypto draft bill and report her department is examining which propose to ban cryptocurrencies. While she views the report as “very futuristic and well-thought-out,” the crypto industry sees it as flawed and incomplete.

Finance Minister Talks About Crypto Report

The Indian finance and corporate affairs minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, talked about the cryptocurrency report and draft bill her ministry is examining in an interview published by The Economic Times on July 29. The report, which contains a draft bill entitled Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019, was made public on July 22. It was submitted by the interministerial committee constituted on Nov. 2, 2017, to study all aspects of cryptocurrency and provide recommendations. The committee has recommended a ban on all “private cryptocurrencies.”

The finance minister was asked during the interview: “When are you proposing to take the legislation to [the] cabinet?” She replied: “I had the presentation done before me. The committee has done extensive work on it. Inputs that have come in; if I compare several other countries where this kind of study has been done on cryptocurrencies, we have done very well.” Sitharaman continued:

They have gone much ahead of all other countries that have thought about it. It’s a very futuristic and well-thought-out report. I have not spent time on it after the presentation.

“Of course, we will look into it soon and come back with a position. That was also reported in court as there is a case going on,” the finance minister concluded.

Several crypto-related writ repetitions are pending at the Supreme Court of India which was scheduled to hear them all on July 23 after repeated delays since last year. At press time, the court still has not heard the case. Some petitions challenge the banking restriction imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank issued a circular in April last year banning regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The court has also asked the government to submit the interministerial committee’s crypto report.

Finance Minister ‘Misinformed’

Varun Sethi, founder of Blockchain Lawyer, shared some thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com on the finance minister’s reply to The Economic Times. The “finance minister has apparently not stated anything negative,” he said. Since her position “falls under the Ministry of Finance, under whom the Department of Economic Affairs also falls, so ideally the report is made under her ministry only,” Sethi added. Noting that the chances of her “commenting publicly against the report don’t stand,” he opined:

There is surely no doubt that Indian report is rather comprehensive however she has reserved her comments about her thoughts post the issuance of report, thereby the reactions by the community are yet to be captured.

Responding to the finance minister’s comments, Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, tweeted to Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs. “Misinformation about crypto has reached our FM due to the flawed crypto report. Ban is never a futuristic solution to anything. Report does not even classify crypto correctly. Please give the crypto industry an opportunity to represent,” he emphasized.

Shetty shared with news.Bitcoin.com:

This is probably the first time she’s spoken about crypto. It’s a start and while her comment is from only one side, the flawed crypto report, we’re hopeful she gives the crypto community of India a chance to present our view of crypto.

“I’m sure she’ll take an informed decision and change her opinion once true facts are laid down in front of her,” he believes. Convinced that the finance minister has been misinformed, he declared: “We need to campaign harder so that the right information about crypto reaches her. She’s been presented an incomplete idea of crypto.”

The Wazirx CEO has been running a social media campaign calling for the Indian government to introduce positive crypto regulation. It has been 271 days since the launch of his campaign. Ever since the interministerial committee’s report was made public, he has ramped up efforts to engage lawmakers to help them understand how flawed the report is, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported.

Commenting on the finance minister’s view on the crypto report, Sumit Gupta, CEO of local crypto exchange Coindcx, told news.Bitcoin.com: “I appreciate the comment of the finance minister and I guess her understanding of the global scenario is much wider.” Noting that the finance minister participated in the recent G20 meetings, he remarked: “I believe her interaction with other finance ministers might help in drawing the midway for the crypto industry. There is always a possibility that the government may not be that harsh on cryptocurrency in order to meet global standards and stay par with the developed world as envisioned by our prime minister. Fingers crossed.”

Social media influencer for the Indian crypto community who goes by Twitter handle “Indian Cryptogirl” also shared some thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com. “I ask you, how is a report that encourages a closed private ledger and criminalizes decentralized public cryptocurrency futuristic?” she said. “India is choosing a national currency because they want money to remain within its borders and to give them control over the supply and monetary policy. This isn’t a cryptocurrency, it’s just another e-payment solution by the government which is recorded on a ledger.” She further elaborated:

In her closing remarks, she said that she will be looking at it again and come to a position. This is why the Indian community is coming together and appealing to national leaders in full force.

Both Sitharaman and Thakur have indicated that they are listening to the community. Sitharaman tweeted in June: “Grateful for every thought/idea that’s being shared by scholars, economists and enthusiasts through print, electronic, and on social media. I read many of them; also, my team carefully collates them for me. Value every bit. Thanks. Please keep them coming.”

As for Thakur, he tweeted on July 26: “I have an open glass door policy. We will continue to have a multi-stakeholder approach to policymaking. I am extremely clear and committed towards this as a minister” (in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government). Thakur recently confirmed in Rajya Sabha, the upper house of India’s parliament, that the government has not banned cryptocurrency in the country.

Industry Body’s Suggestions

The Indian National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) is a non-profit information technology industry association self-described as “the apex body for the 154 billion dollar IT BPM industry in India. Among its initiatives, the group “Liaisons with government and industry to influence a favourable policy framework,” its website states.

The association said Tuesday that, instead of banning, the government should “work towards developing a risk-based framework to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens,” Business Standard reported. This recommendation is in line with the recently issued crypto guidance by the financial action task force (FATF). Nasscom detailed:

A ban would inhibit new applications and solutions from being deployed and would discourage tech startups. It would handicap India from participating in new use cases that cryptocurrencies and tokens offer.

The association believes that “a ban is more likely to deter only the legitimate operators as they have no intent to be non-compliant,” the news outlet conveyed.

“To address consumer protection concerns, cryptocurrency-based businesses can be tested in the regulatory sandboxes being launched by the financial sector regulators across the country,” Nasscom recommends. “We should work towards creating a regulatory framework that will constantly monitor and prevent illegal activities. Regulating would allow the law enforcement agencies to be better equipped to understand these new technologies, enable them to gather intelligence on criminal developments and take enforcement actions.”

This is not the first time Nasscom has spoken in favor of regulating crypto assets. In February, it released a report calling for regulatory certainty, particularly in areas such as cryptocurrency.

Report, Draft Bill, and Garg’s Exit

The report containing the bill to ban cryptocurrencies is dated Feb. 28 even though it was made public on July 22. The interministerial committee drafted the report under the chairmanship of former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Subhash Chandra Garg. The “Committee is very receptive and supportive of distributed ledger technologies and recommends its widespread use in delivering financial services … Private cryptocurrencies are of no real value. Rightly banned,” he tweeted following the public release of the report.

Three days later, Garg announced that he is no longer the DEA Secretary, due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi reshuffling his top-level bureaucrats. Garg has been moved to the Power Ministry, as news.Bitcoin.com reported.

The Financial Conduct Authority said crypto markets were highly dysfunctional, with the onus on consumers to understand the risks associated with investing in unregulated assets.

“A combination of market immaturity, volatility, and a lack of credible information or oversight raises concerns about market integrity, manipulation and insider dealing within cryptoasset markets,” the FCA said in a statement.

Despite those flaws, the FCA said existing rules did not apply to bitcoin and other tokens such as second-biggest coin ethereum, or to firms like exchanges and trading platforms.

The watchdog was laying out which aspects of the nascent crypto industry it regulates -- a milestone in Britain’s regulation of a sector that still forms a tiny part of the broader financial system but which has attracted strong retail investor following.

“We have some concerns around some of the harms that consumers can be exposed to,” Nick Cook, FCA director of innovation, told Reuters, adding that investment by British consumers in crypto was still fairly low.

The FCA said its guidance will inform Britain’s finance ministry as it looks at whether new laws are needed for cryptocurrencies.

The finance ministry said in an emailed comment that the guidance was welcome and that it was planning to consult on unregulated cryptocurrencies later this year.

Retail investors across the world have been drawn to cryptocurrencies, highly volatile assets that unlike fiat money or other assets usually lack guarantees, because of their potential for quick gains.

Other proponents say digital coins could transform payments and how companies raise capital, though such examples are rare.

The treatment of cryptocurrencies by regulators is in focus after Facebook unveiled plans for its Libra coin, sparking a backlash by politicians and regulators across the globe.

G7 finance ministers and central bankers said last month that Libra and other digital currencies raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world’s financial system.

While the FCA did not mention Libra in its guidance, it said that some “stablecoins” -- a form of cryptocurrency, like Libra, backed by assets such as fiat currencies -- could fall under its rules in certain circumstances.

The FCA could not say how Libra would be treated because its structure, design and operating model were still to be determined, Cook said.

Other types of cryptocurrencies, such as security tokens -- coins that provide rights and obligations such as shares or units in funds -- were subject to rules, the FCA said. As such, firms issuing them would need authorization.

CryptoUK, an industry body, called for further clarity.

“Britain’s cryptoasset sector is a key part of the UK fintech industry but needs regulatory certainty to reach its full potential,” chair Iqbal Gandham said in a statement.

PATCHWORK OF RULES

Currently cryptocurrencies are subject to a patchwork of rules that vary from country to country.

Regulators in Britain, the European Union and the United States have looked at how they can apply existing securities, anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules before considering new regulation.

Others, such as China, have banned cryptocurrencies outright. An Indian government panel last week recommended a similar measure.

A handful of smaller countries, from Belarus to Bahrain, have come up with specific laws for digital currencies. Their efforts could help shape the development of the global market and the growth of industry players, from exchange platforms to brokers.

The FCA said it would work closely with other national and international regulators to coordinate approaches.

For now, said Bradley Rice, a lawyer at law firm Ashurst, there was little it could do within its existing powers.

“The FCA’s hands are tied. If the UK wants to bring more crypto assets into the regulatory net, the law has to be changed, and that is in the Treasury’s gift,” he said, referring to Britain’s finance ministry.",2019-07-31 09:21:59+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-financial-regulator-fca-wont-regulate-bitcoin-and-ether,"Britains’ financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), will not regulate Bitcoin (BTC) as a part of its recent guidance on crypto assets.

On July 31, the FCA issued its finalized policy statement on cryptocurrencies in a document titled “PS19/22: Guidance on Cryptoassets.” The document represents an updated version of a consultation paper on crypto assets that was first released for public comment in January 2019, and intends to bring more regulatory clarity to existing types of digital assets.

In the document, the FCA considered major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) as “exchange tokens,” describing them as types of crypto assets that are “usually decentralized and primarily used as a means of exchange.” The regulator emphasized that such digital currencies do not fall under the regulatory scope of the FCA and is outside its remit.

Security tokens and e-money are under regulatory perimeter

On the other hand, two other types of digital assets, including security tokens and utility tokens, do fall under the regulatory perimeter or may be regulated in some sense, the FCA wrote.

As such, the FCA said it will be regulating security tokens as they are considered as digital assets with specific features that provide rights and obligations akin to specified investments such as shares or debt instruments. Meanwhile, activities involving utility tokens may be regulated if they meet the definition of e-money in some circumstances, the FCA stated.

In the paper, the FCA also noted that some stablecoins may fall under the authority’s regulation, still adding that not every stablecoin will meet the definition of e-money, or a security token.

Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported on the FCA preparing a potential ban on the sale of crypto derivatives such as Bitcoin futures to retail investors.",,https://www.coindesk.com/uk-financial-watchdog-issues-full-guidance-on-crypto-assets,"The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has finalized its guidance on crypto assets, clarifying which tokens fall under its jurisdiction.

Most of the rules issued Wednesday were proposed in consultation paper CP19, which was released for public comment in January. As widely expected, the final guidance does not drastically alter the regulatory landscape, instead specifying when certain types of crypto assets fall under existing categories.

True cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, which the FCA classes “exchange tokens,” are not regulated, though anti-money-laundering rules apply.

The FCA said some 92 responses to the consultation paper were received from an assortment of firms, including banks, trade associations and crypto exchanges. Most respondents supported the proposals, said the FCA

Importantly, the guidance provides a definition of security tokens. When issued, these assets behave like shares or debt instruments, including ownership rights, thus falling under the category of a “specified investment” and, in turn, the FCA’s remit. Almost all respondents who answered the question agreed with the regulator’s assessment of security tokens in relation to the regulatory perimeter.

Utility tokens, by contrast, do not grant the same sorts of rights as regulated financial instruments and will generally fall outside the FCA’s remit, except in circumstances when they meet the definition of electronic money and fall within a new category of e-money tokens.

The agency said:

“Any token that is not a security token, or an e-money token is unregulated. However, market participants should note certain activities that use tokens may nevertheless be regulated, for example, when used to facilitate regulated payments.”

Certain stablecoins may also meet the e-money definition, though, and hence would also be subject to oversight by FCA (whose mandate is consumer and investor protection).

The watchdog said, though, that “Market participants should use the Guidance as the first step in understanding how they should treat certain cryptoassets, however definitive judgements can only be made on a case-by-case basis.”

Christopher Woolard, executive director of Strategy and Competition at the FCA, said in a statement:

“This is a small, complex and evolving market covering a broad range of activities. Today’s guidance will help clarify which cryptoasset activities fall inside our regulatory perimeter.”

A firm can issue security tokens without needing a regulatory license, in the same way that issuing shares does not require a license. But in any scenarios in which the tokens are traded, the advisers and brokers handling the tokens, and the financial promotions regime, will need authorization, said the FCA.

If a security token is tradeable on the capital market, said the FCA, it will further be considered a transferable security under the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), and that regime will apply too.

Blurred lines

The initial coin offering explosion of 2017-18 has largely abated, removing some of the pressure on regulators, but there are still wrinkles when it comes to the business of defining certain types of crypto assets.

Given the growing popularity of security token offerings, there could be a blurring of the lines between those and utility tokens, according to Jacqui Hatfield, a partner specializing in crypto at the London office of law firm Orrick.

Hatfield pointed to possible cases when a utility token could wind up being dressed in a security token wrapper, telling CoinDesk:

“The interesting thing is where you have got utility tokens that are dressed up as security tokens just to make sure that they don’t fall foul of any promotion type restrictions. So the question is, does that actually change the nature of the token itself when it comes to trading it?”

In this regard, Nick Cook, director of innovation, FCA, reiterated the need to look at the nature of individual tokens and issuances on a case-case basis. “We don’t rely on the labeling, particularly with something like stablecoins, where we find the terminology is not especially helpful, because it could be a security token, it could be an e-money token, or it could be an unregulated token,” Cook told CoinDesk, adding:

“So an individual or entity may attempt to make a token appear, in one way or another, to fit within or without the parameters, but we always look at the underlying characteristics.”

As stated in the original consultation paper, utility tokens might meet the definition of e-money in certain circumstances (as could other tokens), in which case activities in relation to them may be within the FCA’s jurisdiction.

The FCA agreed further clarity between types of tokens was required and said it will separate e-money tokens from the utility tokens and security tokens categories. “This will create a specific regulated e-money token category and an unregulated category that includes utility tokens,” said the regulator.

Stablecoins, which are designed to maintain parity with fiat currency, may also fall within the definition of e-money, according to the paper. These may be considered electronic money where the crypto asset is issued on receipt of funds (i.e. fiat currency, not other crypto assets) and is accepted by a person other than the electronic money issuer.

This would include crypto assets that are issued on receipt of British pounds and are pegged to that currency, as long as the asset is accepted by a third party, noted Hatfield.

The FCA refers to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether which have no controlling authority or centralized issuer as exchange tokens and these are outside its parameters of regulation. However, exchange tokens will be caught (along with other crypto assets) by the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which will be transposed into UK law by the end of 2019.

Bradley Rice, senior regulatory associate at law firm Ashurst, said the more interesting paper will be from the Treasury because this could amend the regulatory perimeter – something the FCA was at pains to state in its response, adding:

“The FCA’s hands are tied. If the UK wants to bring more crypto assets into the regulatory net, the law has to be changed and that is in the Treasury’s gift.”

Derivatives ban

Perhaps the most controversial move by the FCA – one separate from Wednesday’s guidance – is the proposed ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors, including options, futures, contracts for difference (CFDs) and exchange-traded notes with underlying (unregulated) cryptoassets like bitcoin, for example.

Starting in August, the FCA is making restrictions for non-crypto CFDs and then at the start of September for non crypto CFD-like options. The consultation for how to deal with derivatives with underlying crypto assets ends October 3; the FCA’s proposal on this is a blanket ban.

Hatfield said the notion of a ban on crypto derivatives was the only thing set out in the FCA’s crypto regulations she staunchly disagrees with.

“The intention is that this will become a blanket ban for retail generally in the future,” she said, concluding:

“My view is these should be treated like derivatives on the retail market generally, like any other derivative because these are no riskier.”

Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Andrew Bailey, via SIFMA",2019-07-31 10:00:32+00:00,https://www.finsmes.com/2019/07/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-money-laundering-concerns.html,"Before venturing into cryptocurrency trading, it only stands to reason that you must first know what crypto is.

There are many types of cryptocurrencies available, and as with any venture, you must also be up-to-date with the trends and news about crypto. This is to avoid buying or trading cryptocurrencies that might empty your pocket. In keeping abreast with the news about cryptocurrencies, one hot topic involving that right now is Facebook Libra.

You may or may not have heard about this controversial topic, but what matters essentially is knowing about the coin you’re trying to buy or learning about it before investing in it. Facebook Libra may be famous, but you must first weigh whether it’s worth the risk or not.

What is Cryptocurrency?

Before tackling the issue of Facebook Libra, you must first be aware of what exactly cryptocurrency is. From the words crypto and currency, cryptocurrency, or popularly known as crypto, is a type of digital currency. It has anti-counterfeiting and security measures called cryptography, which is used in crypto exchanges or transfers from one person to another.

In layman’s terms, cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is exchanged in a decentralized currency system. This means that no banks or middlemen or central server charges you fees to record your balances. All it has is a shared database known as the blockchain to keep every financial transaction done by parties exchanging such currency.

Unlike banks, crypto transactions are not run by only one organization but by different companies and people.

Is Libra a Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, altcoins, and many more are the ones already known. Libra, on the other hand, is a stable coin according to Facebook.

Unlike cryptocurrencies that use a decentralized system, a stable coin is backed by government security. Although it’s a fiat currency, stable coins, as compared to cryptocurrencies, are less volatile and more stable, hence the name. Facebook, therefore, claims that Libra is a stable coin. To understand more about cryptocurrencies, one must first know the different types of cryptocurrencies that are in circulation.

Difference between Libra, Bitcoin, and Other Cryptocurrencies

Although Libra is pegged as a cryptocurrency, it’s a bit different from Bitcoin. The major difference is the technology used for each currency.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies use blockchain to record every transaction. Blockchain is a network of computers forming a database so no individual can easily tamper with or control it.

Libra uses a distributed ledger technology, which is similar to the blockchain. However, technology is permissioned, which means that trusted parties are the only ones who can add transactions. These parties are from companies like Uber, Visa, and the like, forming what they call the Libra Association.

The Libra Association manages and holds the funds of the currency through its permissioned ledger.

Generally, when it comes to purpose, Bitcoin is used as an investment, while Libra is mainly used in money transfers and cross-border payments. Libra is said to be stable as other assets and government currencies back it up so that it won’t be as volatile as other cryptocurrencies.

While this may sound advantageous, there are concerns that have arisen.

Concerns on Facebook Libra

Facebook Libra’s primary goal is to become a currency that can be used worldwide without the complications that regular money has when exchanged. But governments around the world have voiced out their fears over Libra, prompting them to interrogate it before its launching.

Here are some reasons why governments want Libra to be interrogated:

Controlling – Although met with opposition by some government officials, Facebook claims that it will not have sole control over Libra because of the existence of the Libra Association members. When it comes to financial aspects, Libra Founders will gain from their invested money into Libra. Each founder has at least 10 million USD into it.

Having a New Global Financial System – With Facebook’s network, it can potentially replace state currencies if not compete with them. Because Libra’s primary purpose is to be used globally, government entities such as the Bank of England, the French Senate, and others are questioning Libra’s proposal, which they claim to be vague and not sufficiently detailed. In addition, some countries like India are already planning to ban Libra even before its launch.

Unregulated – Since the Libra Association are a group of private entities that will be responsible for Libra’s blockchain, central regulation is out. Although Facebook plans to partner with the government, the former still insists on less monitoring. Moreover, the US is adamant about subjecting cryptos and Libra to banking regulations.

Attracting Criminals – One of the major issues surrounding Facebook’s Libra is its possibility to become a financial platform for crime syndicates and other high-rated criminals. Criminals such as drug syndicates, terrorists, and money launderers are only a few of the criminals that governments believe can use Libra’s financial system without breaking a sweat.

What is Money Laundering?

One of the principles of money laundering is the act of crime syndicates or terrorists to get their funds to look like they came from a legitimate source. For instance, criminals will take advantage of complicated financial transactions so that authorities cannot trace the origin of the laundered money.

How Does Crypto or Digital Currency Cater to Money Laundering?

Although transactions can be viewed by anyone publicly, it cannot be denied that a lot of criminals use Bitcoins for their illicit activities. The reason for this is the possibility of hiding the real identity of the person spending, receiving, and sending cryptocurrencies.

Here are ways on how the criminals can launder their illicit money:

Mixing Bitcoins – Tumblers or Bitcoin mixers launder money through wallets hosted on the dark web. They divide and bounce clean cryptocurrencies to different addresses before recombining it. However, you would need two or more Bitcoin wallets so you can run them on the dark and standard web. It may cost them fees, but it’s not a big loss on their funds since it will turn their illicit money into a clean one.

However, you would need two or more Bitcoin wallets so you can run them on the dark and standard web. It may cost them fees, but it’s not a big loss on their funds since it will turn their illicit money into a clean one. Using Unregulated Exchanges – One way to launder money without using a mixer is through an unregulated cryptocurrency exchange. These exchanges do not adhere to AML or Anti-Money Laundering Laws, or KYC or Know Your Customer procedures. These platforms do not require identity checks for the sender or receiver so they can exchange altcoins or Bitcoins across different markets. After which, they can withdraw it to their external wallet, though it’s quite hard for unregulated exchanges to find fiat markets accepting them.

After which, they can withdraw it to their external wallet, though it’s quite hard for unregulated exchanges to find fiat markets accepting them. Turning to Peer-to-Peer Markets – Since fiat markets don’t generally accept the withdrawal of unregulated exchanges, these criminals turn to dark deeds or peer-to-peer markets so they can change their Bitcoins into cash. For instance, a drug syndicate can sell their drugs using Bitcoins then later withdraw their Bitcoins into cash.

Facebook Libra and Money Laundering

Since money laundering can now be done through digital currencies, the more that governments are becoming concerned about the issues involving Facebook Libra. Fears of using Libra’s financial system to launder illicit funds from different criminal entities have heightened, especially with Facebook’s numerous connections. The secretary of the US Treasury plans to look into the whitepaper of Libra until regulatory issues are solved.

This is what Facebook has to say about money laundering issues:

Register with FinCEN – Facebook vows to wait for the decision of the US government before launching its Libra. In its proposal, the Libra is set to register with the FinCEN or Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department. FinCEN combats financial crimes like terrorist financing, international and domestic money laundering by analyzing the information collected from financial transactions. With this registration, Libra will be forced to comply with anti-money laundering rules and regulations.

With this registration, Libra will be forced to comply with anti-money laundering rules and regulations. Follow Regulatory Frameworks – Since Geneva is the headquarters of the Libra Association, Facebook expects that its privacy regulator will be the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner. Moreover, it says that they are planning to follow the proper regulatory framework set by the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority.

Moreover, it says that they are planning to follow the proper regulatory framework set by the Swiss Financial Markets Supervisory Authority. Comply with Anti-Money Laundering Laws – Facebook claims to also intend to adhere with the Anti-Money Laundering Laws on cryptocurrencies. AML Regulation has gone worldwide. Its standards apply to all virtual assets operations or activities. Here are some of the AML’s salient features:

Virtual Currency Exchanges or VCE’s special licensing requirements AML rules cover wallet services and administrators Securities law cover ICOs FI or Fulfilling Identification – Needed to establish a customer relationship. This process includes confirming the real identity of the client before any deal or transaction. For instance, a person wanting to use a crypto wallet must verify his identity by taking a photo of himself together with his national or valid ID as required by the wallet. Account Monitoring or KYC – This involves letting your customer understand what the business relationship is all about Transaction Recordkeeping and Reporting – Crypto transactions, as well as the real identity of crypto holders, are sent to FIs for verification and audit.

Expect Licensing – Facebook also planned to be licensed before its full launch. It has already applied to the Department of Financial Services of the US for it to operate a crypto business legally. Since they will be licensed, Facebook will also incur capital gains taxes and sales tax.

Partnership with Local Stores – With Libra being a digital currency, Facebook also stated that it has been collaborating with local money exchanges and stores against money laundering. Facebook will use QR codes to let people sell or buy Libra in person, or when people will cash out or cash in Libra for state currencies.

Complement Financial Systems Already in Existence – Facebook also said that it wouldn’t work as a bank, but only to support the existing financial system.

Operate in Specific Areas – Since Libra’s goal is to be compliant and regulated, markets allowing Libra operation will proceed only where they will be.

Use Anti-Fraud/Laundering Check – Since Calibra, the wallet of Libra, will be integrated into WhatsApp and Messenger, only people with connected government ID and bank accounts can trade Libra.

Partnering with NGOs – Since a lot of areas do not have an ID, such as those in refugee camps, Facebook also stated that it would let non-government organizations or NGOs be part of the Libra Association. With it, they can expect to work with entities for identity authentication and confirmation.

Moreover, during the July 12, 2019 Senate Banking Committee, Facebook has presented the following:

1. Outdated US Financial Regulations Have been Shunned – Facebook has shown that the traditional financial system lessens commerce due to its limitations and barriers. For instance, the trade of US dollars and digital currency is made difficult as the majority of banks has banned these transactions. And to solve this problem, stable coins such as Libra have been created so that investors can trade state currencies and digital currencies without any complications. Moreover, Facebook claimed that if Congress had allowed banks to let investors trade in fiat and cryptocurrencies, then stable coins would not have arisen.

2. Payment Systems Have been Innovated – Digital currencies, including Libra, is seen to be one of the most significant innovations for payment from all over the world to become more efficient. Traditional payment systems take time for money to be transferred from one platform or bank account to another. As a result, capitals are trapped in banks as it takes days for it to be confirmed. But with Libra, it aims to transfer money from one wallet to another in a matter of seconds. Only then will fast flow of cash can help more companies to work out their capitals.

3. Compliant Framework Can Fit Digital Currencies – Since lawmakers have developed a roadmap and guidelines for digital currencies, all bankruptcy and legal disputes will follow regulated and established rules. For instance, if Libra will have a legal discussion, a law has already been built where judges know what to do with cases on digital currencies.

Conclusion

To sum it up, it appears that Facebook Libra has been developing more of its whitepaper since its first announcement. Facebook said that its announcement is a way to gather information on what areas should they focus on or establish. As with money laundering issues, Facebook claims that Libra will use KYC as a defense against any laundering or illicit activities of criminals. Moreover, Facebook has been collaborating with government and private entities to ensure that measures against money laundering will be hindered.",2019-07-31 19:59:40+00:00,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/19/07/14165494/fastest-crypto-exchange-in-the-world-released-to-retail-market,"The crypto wallet Blockchain announced Tuesday that it has launched The PIT, an institutional-grade crypto exchange with microsecond-latency.

“The current crypto exchange market is outdated, broken, and skewed against users. We got tired of waiting for a new entrant to deliver the performance today’s traders demand,” Peter Smith, Blockchain's CEO and co-founder, said in a statement.

The platform is intended to enable liquidity and fast execution in an emerging field that is gaining interest from institutions and retail traders alike.

""Over the last year, a stealth team inside the company composed of veterans from NYSE, TD Ameritrade Holding Corp (NASDAQ: AMTD), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS), UBS Group AG (NYSE: UBS), Interactive Brokers and Revolut, built The PIT to be lighting fast, fair, and reliable,"" according to Blockchain.

Most cryptocurrency exchanges run alongside ""slow, consumer"" cloud applications, Tom Haller, who previously worked as the chief software architect of trading systems at the NYSE, said in a statement.

""The PIT leverages best practices from Wall Street to facilitate rapid, efficient, and high-quality trade execution at HFT speeds.”

In a blog post from July 31, Rain confirmed it had received a Crypto-Asset Module license from the Central Bank of Bahrain.

The license came the same week Rain announced successful closure of a $2.5 million funding round backed by partners including the VC arm of crypto derivatives giant BitMEX. Kuwaiti blockchain fund Blockwater also contributed. The blog post reads:

“With this license, Rennes has become the first encrypted currency trading platform in the Middle East to be fully licensed by a regulatory entity and join a limited range of internationally recognized platforms for currency trading.”

As Cointelegraph reported, the Middle East market has traditionally proven a tough environment for crypto businesses, specifically those involved in trading.

Islamic banking laws forbid certain types of transactions, with scholars in different jurisdictions giving conflicting opinions as to whether cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) conform to norms that frown on speculation and interest lending.

Rain did not mention the issue, instead stressing its position as a fully-compliant financial operator and ability to form meaningful ties with local banks. The blog post continues:

“Through licensing, we have demonstrated our commitment to the terms of the encrypted assets unit in terms of capital adequacy, cybersecurity, insurance, reporting, governance and other matters that ensure our readiness to provide our services to both institutional and individual clients.”

The ranking results were published by Forex Crunch on July 31.

The CCID Research Institute is an initiative of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology that provides a monthly assessment of cryptocurrency projects. The assessment takes into account 37 cryptocurrencies and considers their properties such as basic technology, applicability and innovation, which put together form a total value index.

Cryptocurrency project EOS (EOS) leads the list, having gained the highest number of points at 153.1. EOS is followed by Ether (ETH) with 148.6 points, while Tron (TRX) took third place. Open-source, enterprise-grade project NULS (NULS) and blockchain project GXchain are ranked fourth and fifth, respectively.

Bitcoin scored only 103 points in the assessment, which brought it to the eleventh place — up four places from the rankings released in March. In February, Bitcoin had moved from number 15 to number 13, then falling back down two spots to occupy 15th place again.

Notably, EOS is the all-time leader in the CCID’s rankings. EOS had previously faced controversy with critics targeting its apparent lack of decentralization and ability to reverse transactions as areas of concern.

The Saveh Police Department's Anti-Trafficking Police seized a truck allegedly carrying 117 cryptocurrency mining machines to the value of 11.7 billion Iranian rials ($277,876 at press time).

According to Sardar Kiomars Azizi, a Police News Agency official, the police confiscated the aforementioned crypto mining equipment and arrested the truck driver.

Crypto mining in complicated regulatory territory

The news comes in the wake of the Iranian government’s authorization of cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity in July. Now, entities engaged in the crypto mining will be required to seek a license from Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade.

The government’s decision nonetheless underscores that using cryptocurrencies for domestic transactions remains outlawed and that those engaged in the industry should bear responsibility for the risks without any guarantees from the government or local banking sector.

While mining may now be legal, Deputy President of the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration Jamal Arounaghi recently noted that the agency has not issued any licenses for importing the equipment.

Electricity costs and economic contribution

Also in July, the Iranian Economic Commission finalized an electricity pricing scheme for cryptocurrency miners. Energy Minister Homayoon Ha’eri did not elaborate on the exact price scheme, although he stated that the price is dependent on market factors such as fuel prices in the Persian Gulf.

The head of Iran Electrical Industry Syndicate, Ali Bakhshi, previously proposed a price of $0.07 per kilowatt hour for cryptocurrency miners. Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, the Energy Ministry spokesman for the power department, previously stated that the production of a single Bitcoin uses about $1,400 in state subsidies.

Governor of the Central Bank of Iran Abdolnaser Hemmati previously argued that digital currency miners in Iran should contribute to the country’s economy, rather than letting mined Bitcoin (BTC) escape abroad.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-banks-to-hedge-dollar-risks-with-bitcoin-pompliano-predicts,"Every central bank will be buying Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge risks to the United States dollar, according to a forecast by major crypto bull Anthony Pompliano.

In a tweet on Aug. 1, Pompliano, co-founder of asset manager firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets, noted the recent news that central banks made the largest historical acquisition of gold.

As reported by The Financial Times, global central banks purchased a record of $15.7 billion in the first half of 2019 in order to diversify their reserves from the U.S. dollar amid global trade tensions. According to the report, central banks accounted for almost one-sixth of total gold demand in the period.

Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset

While the World Gold Council expects geopolitical uncertainty to keep pressure on central banks to build gold reserves, Pompliano now predicts that banks will turn to Bitcoin as a store of value that is unrelated to traditional assets. He wrote:

“Wait till they find out about the non-correlated, asymmetric upside profile of Bitcoin. Every central bank will be buying Bitcoin.”

The new forecast follows a recent debate on CNBC Africa between Pompliano and gold bug Peter Schiff, who said that Bitcoin became some form of religion, and that investors are only hoping to get rich from their holdings while blind to reality. Schiff said, “When you’re in a bubble, you can’t see the bubble,” and maintained that the Bitcoin had no intrinsic value.

Previously, Forbes editor-in-chief Steve Forbes published an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, advising to back their cryptocurrency Libra with gold. According to Forbes, the stablecoin project will become “one of history’s truly seminal creations” if backed by the yellow metal.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/square-doubles-bitcoin-revenue-generating-125-million-via-cash-app-in-q2,"Payments company Square has generated $125 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue in the second quarter of 2019 through its mobile payments service Cash App.

Square released the information in the company’s Q2 2019 shareholder letter on Aug. 1. According to the letter, the company’s Bitcoin revenue benefited in part from the number one cryptocurrency’s price rally over the quarter. As a result of this price growth, there was also a correspondingly increased volume of Bitcoin, they say. This resulted in a $2 million gross profit for the company.

Cash App obtained $135 million in subscription-, services- and transaction-based revenue. This means that Bitcoin revenue alone almost matched these other services combined.

In Square’s Q1 2019 report in May, the company revealed that it achieved a new revenue high from Bitcoin sales via Cash App, with a stated Bitcoin revenue of $65.5 million. This means Square has more than doubled its Bitcoin revenue compared to the preceding quarter.

Square: a company bullish on Bitcoin

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Steve Lee, a project manager at Square’s crypto branch — Square Crypto — heavily emphasized the company’s belief in Bitcoin in an ask me anything session on Twitter. Lee wrote that the company was “very, very pro-Bitcoin.”

Square also recently released a Bitcoin deposits feature on Cash App in late June. This reportedly enables Bitcoin users to deposit their assets from external wallets into Square’s payments application. However, the announcement cautioned that there would be some limitations — a cap of $10,000 in Bitcoin per seven days, and a wait of up to several hours to confirm the deposits via blockchain.

So far, only five states have added “virtual currency” to their escheatment laws — Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Utah, and Colorado. New York’s recently proposed bill would be the sixth.

Given that many in the libertarian-leaning crypto community favor Bitcoin precisely because it was specifically designed to operate out of state control, you’d think this piece of news would have incited fear, fury, and the donning of some tinfoil hats to block out government brain-rays trying to get to the private keys of their crypto wallets. After all, this policy could be read as the government asserting all cryptocurrency held by U.S. citizens ultimately belongs to it.

Instead, the response to this news reflects a maturing of the cryptocurrency space. The people that comprise it realize how much the U.S. government has already stepped in when it comes to regulating decentralized currencies, and they grasp how little expanded policies will be able to touch their precious digital coins.

“This is not an issue if you hold your own coins, clearly, as there's no way for anyone to seize coins without the private key, at least on Bitcoin,” crypto evangelist Jimmy Song told me over email. A diehard Bitcoin maximalist (as in, a member of the crypto community who believes Bitcoin is the only viable cryptocurrency), Song has been known to storm out of a public debate if his opponent too brutally challenges his beloved BTC. To him, escheatment is no threat (at least when it comes to Bitcoin).

But before we hear more from crypto holders, there’s a lot to unpack here. First, there are the practical questions: How can states claim assets, especially ones that aren’t even physical? Does a state’s ability to seize cryptocurrency under any circumstances fundamentally negate the draw of money that was designed to be stateless? And, most importantly: What is escheatment, a term that sounds like it belongs in a Charles Dickens novel, doing bouncing around our state legislatures?

Let’s start with question three. Escheatment as a term goes back to feudal England, where a monarch owned all the land in his kingdom and would essentially rent it out to tenants-in-chief, who would “hold” the land but not own it. These landholders would be able to bequeath the land on which they lived to their heirs, meaning they had ownership-like rights, even though the land ultimately belonged to the higher ruling power. But if the tenant-in-chief made the foolish mistake of, say, committing treason, they’d lose all their land privileges. The land they held would go back to the monarch, with no chance of the tenant’s heirs ever gaining possession.

Escheatment law has long since been adapted to modern day property ownership. In the U.S., it applies to assets like stocks and bonds, wages, or insurance payments issued by payment processors. This is the law that lets the government take the $18 in Krispy Kreme stock your Aunt Doris gave you for your Bat Mitzvah, but you forgot about when you moved the next year while the statements continued to get sent to (and bounce back from) your old address.

Most states have escheatment laws that asset-holding and payment-granting financial institutions must follow. These institutions have to “basically pay attention to the things that they’re holding for people,” says James Foust, a senior research fellow at Coin Center, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that aims to increase the public’s understanding of cryptocurrency and decentralized technologies. If a customer fails to contact a financial institution holding their assets for a set period of time, usually between one and five years, “there’s an assumption that property has been abandoned.” The institution must alert state government and hand over the funds.

Ultimately, the onus is on the financial institutions to do this. A centralized exchange like massively popular Coinbase would be obligated to hand over the Bitcoin sitting in a customer’s digital wallet if that customer failed to log into their account or otherwise touch base with the exchange in, say, a five-year period. But if someone keeps their Bitcoin in a private wallet, which is an app or physical device that’s only accessible to the owner by way of a string of numbers and letters known as a digital key, the government wouldn’t be able to touch it. (It’s worth noting that those who embrace cryptocurrency because it’s decentralized wouldn’t keep their crypto with a bank-like institution such as Coinbase to begin with, which helps explain Song’s confidence that this won’t be an issue… for people like him.)

James Foust of Coin Center gives the example of a bank sending checking account statements that keep bouncing back in the mail, because the person who opened the account changed their address and stopped logging into their account online. After a certain number of years, the bank is obligated to turn those funds over to the state’s department of revenue. If the account holder resurfaces to claim the money, the state can return it. The same would go for cryptocurrency abandoned in Coinbase for five years in Illinois — the exchange would have to ultimately hand it over to the state.

This time lapse doesn’t affect the value of money sitting in a checking account, but it does make a difference if you’re reclaiming an abandoned asset with regularly shifting value like crypto. When a state claims an abandoned stock under escheatment laws, says Foust, the government will auction it on the market within a year or so. If the original owner of that stock shows up to reclaim it, they won’t get their stock back. They’ll get whatever the value it sold for when the government decided to auction it off.

“For example, if you bought [one] Bitcoin in 2012, and now you are trying to get it back, you wouldn't want what [the government] sold it for 2014,” says Foust, referring to an era in which one Bitcoin was worth around $500. “You’d want $10,000,” which was Bitcoin’s price at the time Foust and I spoke.

The true devotees of crypto, however, love it for its independence from the state more than its investment value. These are the people who post libertarian screeds from their Twitter accounts, or people who live as off-the-grid as possible in part because they don’t like the government telling them what to do with their money.

Trent Larson identifies as an anarchist and a Mormon and is the principal software developer for Medici Land Governance, which uses blockchain to track land ownership. (The last time I saw him, he was participating in a New York Blockchain Week panel while shoeless.) He isn’t concerned about states including cryptocurrency in their escheatment policies because it’s a drop in the bucket compared to “all the other regulations” the government has already imposed on cryptocurrency holders.

In June, the heavyweight crypto exchange Binance blocked U.S. customers from trading on its platform, and Larson says his account was suspended from the Sweden-based trading platform Nova Exchange because of his location in the United States. Multiple crypto companies exited New York State in 2015 because of what their CEOs called “regulatory overreach” inherent in acquiring a BitLicense, which would allow them to operate in the state. (Many cryptocurrencies, including Facebook’s in-the-works Libra coin, establish themselves as non-profit foundations in nations such as Switzerland and Estonia.) But at the same time, the U.S. may not be tech-savvy enough to make good on regulatory threats.

While the federal government owns some cryptocurrency and can claim the asset when it’s seized in, say, drug raids, says Foust, “I don't know how many, if any, states have built out a similar capacity. But they may be interested in doing so if they think there is a significant amount of potentially abandoned cryptocurrency property in their state.”

Plus, escheatment only applies to assets held with third-party custodians, such as centralized cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase. Song, for one, is convinced that third-party custodians will “heavily resist” turning over customers’ unclaimed assets. “Exchanges, etc. will try very hard to keep the coins on behalf of their customers and will try to delay any seizure as much as possible,” Song claimed. Given that Coinbase has already succumbed to government pressure by submitting user data to the IRS, that may be wishful thinking on his part.

Combine Song’s optimistic position with the conviction of true Bitcoin believers, and you can wind up with an entirely, shall we say, optimistic outlook on the future of cryptocurrency in the U.S.

“States are always looking for ways to raise money,” Max Keiser, host of financial commentary show “Keiser Report” told me via encrypted messaging app Telegram (he prefers for his communications to remain as off-the-grid as possible as he travels around the country, tearing up U.S. dollars). “What’s new with Bitcoin is that individuals can opt out of the state.”

“I envision a time when states come to the Bitcoin community for a bailout,” he added. “We might oblige, but obviously, we’d have to be able to write the laws in exchange. He who has the Bitcoins, makes the laws.”

Keiser seems to almost envision a post-apocalyptic feudalism run by crypto lords, where holding Bitcoin is the new version of land ownership and those who’ve failed to buy in are the peasants. Where the Winklevoss twins, with their hoards of Bitcoin, finally rule over former Facebook rival Mark Zuckerberg, whose Libra remains stuck in regulatory limbo. Where preppers with bomb shelters full of canned peas they bought with Bitcoin will let “no-coiners” partake only if they agree to till the digital fields by setting up cryptocurrency mining rigs for the benefit of their digitally savvy overlord. Where the only people who own anything own strings of computer code that gives them the financial power to dictate the provenance of all earthly assets. (Despite the total lack of government or infrastructure in such a world, it would, evidently, still have electricity.)

Escheatment laws, in this possible world, would not come for your Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin would determine whose property you get to claim.

As Keiser sees it, we’re already well on our way there. The recent Facebook/Libra hearings, he said, “opened up [a path] for Bitcoin to slice right through any governmental attempt to stop it.”

It’s true that after the hearing, the Republican Congressman Patrick McHenry did say that there is “no capacity to kill Bitcoin.” Given that the cryptocurrency isn’t controlled by any single entity, not even the government can push a button to shut it down, or even effectively make rules about its distribution (except for forcing holders to pay taxes, in U.S. dollars, on crypto-related gains). This acknowledgment of how Bitcoin works got those in the crypto community excited — just as a small child gets excited when their parents learn the rules to a complex game they’ve invented.

But what these crypto holders may not realize is that once the parents know the rules of the game, they have even more ability to ruin it.",,https://www.nuwireinvestor.com/pros-cons-investing-cryptocurrency/,"You may have heard about the new craze surrounding cryptocurrency nowadays. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are some of the more popular types today. You can think of them as digital cash that can be used to pay for goods or services no matter where the seller is located.

The most notable characteristic of cryptocurrency is that it isn’t controlled by one authority, like a government or financial institution. This decentralization is brought about by peer-to-peer transactions facilitated by blockchain technology, which confirms the processes involved in the transfers and records them in a ledger viewable by the public.

Don’t fret, it’s only the address, transaction hash, and block number that are shared to everyone, while other details are kept private. If you’re thinking about trying your hand at cryptocurrency, the best way to start is to invest in Bitcoins, which are the most popular. You can learn about the whole industry by studying previous BTC trends and applying valuable principles to other cryptocurrency investments.

Here are some pros and cons to help you decide:

Pros

Valuable Trading Software

The cryptocurrency mania has just reached mainstream media recently. If you invest now and grow your digital funds through trading or mining, you can ride the tide when it soars, and sell your assets for a higher price.

Mining happens when you use your computer to solve complex mathematical problems to help the blockchain process transactions.

Trading, on the other hand, involves buying Bitcoin or Ethereum coins using real money and waiting for optimal times to sell. It’s the most straightforward way of profiting from cryptocurrency.

These are the tools that can help you trade cryptocurrency:

Coinbase– To start trading, you need to have a reliable digital currency wallet and platform, like Coinbase, that allows you to join the market. As of this writing, the website has more than 30 million users all over the world with whom you can exchange digital assets.

Bitcoin Profit – For crypto trading beginners, Bitcoin Profit is a perfect software because it helps you monitor optimal market prices and helps you decide the best time to buy or sell cryptocurrency for higher profit margin.

CoinTracking – This one is a crypto portfolio manager that tracks your digital assets on various exchanges for better monitoring. The platform also has graphs and charts to aid you in your trading venture.

Coinigy – With its app and website, you can trade different cryptocurrencies on several exchanges with just a single account. Diversifying your market can help you make more money in Bitcoin or Ethereum trading.

CoinMarketCap – The website is a valuable resource that provides cryptocurrency prices, volume, market cap, as well as coin and token listings. The wealth of insight and information that CoinMarketCap offers can help you make the right decisions concerning your digital money.

Transfer With Ease, Swiftness, and Security

The process of transferring funds is straightforward. You just need to click on a few buttons and confirm the transaction. The payment can also be received in real-time because there are thousands of miners that process these computations.

Plus, it’s done through private and public keys, which ensure that each transaction is safe and secure.

Anonymity

While each transaction’s address, hash, blockchain number, and miner name are recorded in the ledger for all to see, the process of trading and transferring your digital assets is anonymous.

This is ideal if you are wary about giving out too many personal details online due to the high risk of identity theft.

Accessibility

Because there’s no central authority governing the transactions, you can trade cryptocurrency at any time of the day as long as another user is active. Peer-to-peer transfers can happen no matter where you and the recipient are in the world.

Trading platforms are also available 24/7. Unlike traditional stock trading, you can exchange assets with other users any time since someone else can trade with you from other countries.

Autonomy

You have complete control over your cryptocurrency funds, from how you choose to earn it, where you want to spend your digital money, and to whom you want to send it.

This makes it an ideal alternative investment for your retirement or your kids’ trust fund.

Cons

Volatility

Price fluctuation is a significant issue for cryptocurrencies. It may be due to the fact that it’s still relatively new and people tend to mistrust these intangible funds. Moreover, even though a single country or entity doesn’t govern it, news reports on major world events can affect a cryptocurrency’s price.

Volatility can be a disadvantage if you want to trade with low risks and gain considerable rewards in the long-term. However, you can look at it positively since this characteristic allows you to take advantage of the times when the price goes very low and buy lots of assets, which you can sell when the value increases after a short period.

Tricky Concept

The idea of cryptocurrency and how it works is very technical, which makes it challenging to understand for most people who aren’t experts in the field of technology.

Nonetheless, it’s possible to gain more knowledge on the subject as long as you put in the time and effort to study its ins and outs. Similar to traditional stock trading, you have to determine the factors that affect its price as well as learn how to read graphs and charts that can help you make the right investing decisions.

Theft Risks

Even though cryptocurrency is intangible, there’s still the possibility of theft through hacking. Hackers have sophisticated tools that they use to infiltrate cryptocurrency wallets and trading platforms to intercept transactions and send the funds their way. That’s why it’s crucial that you choose a secure exchange channel with measures in place to prevent this type of theft from happening.

You should also practice online safety habits like ensuring that the website you’re trading on has a secure connection. Another way to deter digital theft is to avoid sharing information to strangers and on shady sites.

Conclusion

Investing in cryptocurrency has become more straightforward because of the valuable trading software that’s available. Moreover, you also have complete control over your digital assets and can transfer funds to anyone, anywhere, and anytime anonymously because of its decentralized nature.

Meanwhile, the volatility of the market can be viewed as a disadvantage along with the challenging concept as well as the risks for theft through hacking.",2019-08-01 14:46:10+00:00,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/01/85-percent-bitcoin-mined-cryptocurrency/,"Sound the alarm, bang the gong, yodel down an Austrian valley; as of yesterday over 85-percent of the total Bitcoin BTC supply has been mined. But seriously, there’s no need to worry.

According to various Bitcoin blockchain explorers and market information websites, over 17,850,000 Bitcoin (17,850,600 according to CoinMarketCap) have been mined and are classed as being “in circulation.” That’s a hair over 85 percent of the cryptocurrency‘s supply limit of 21 million coins.

Credit: CoinMarketCap Circulating supply of Bitcoin over 17,850,000

As a result, there are just over 3,000,000 Bitcoin left to mine, until we inch closer to that fabled 21 millionth coin.

There’s no need to panic, though. The fact that Bitcoin has a limited supply is generally regarded a good thing, it gives the coin anti-inflationary properties. In other words, Bitcoin‘s finite supply gives it scarcity and value, preventing it from being devalued by a limitless supply.

Imagine if there were a limitless supply of gold… you get the idea.

New Bitcoins are created when a sufficient number of mining nodes have verified a block of transactions. The miners are issued a reward in the cryptocurrency for each block mined, in doing so, more Bitcoin is put into circulation.

Every time 210,000 blocks are added to the blockchain, the mining reward is halved to ensure a steady supply of Bitcoin. Generally speaking, this happens every four years.

“Coins have to get initially distributed somehow, and a constant rate seems like the best formula.”

– Satoshi Nakamoto, cryptography mailing list, 2008

At present, miners are rewarded with 12.5 Bitcoin for every block mined. At current hash rates the next reward halving is expected to happen in May next year. After which, miners will be rewarded with 6.25 Bitcoin per block.

This isn’t perfect, though. Eventually, the 21 million coin limit will effectively be reached and mining rewards will become insignificant. One idea, posited by Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper, suggests that the network will have to shift to rewarding miners with transaction fees.

But with the coin’s current production rate of 1,800 BTC per day until May 2020, and the projection this will halve every 210,000 blocks, it’ll be the year 2140 by the time we get close to Bitcoin’s 21 million coins limit.

That’s plenty of time to prepare. In fact, it’s really a problem for the next generation to deal with, assuming the world doesn’t disintegrate into a ball of fire fueled by single-use plastics by then.

Update August 1, 2019, 1244UTC: Update for clarity.",2019-08-01,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/01/early-crypto-investor-novogratz-likens-beyond-meats-surge-to-the-bitcoin-bubble.html,"Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz is seeing the same rush of enthusiasm toward Beyond Meat that came at the height of the crypto bubble.

The former Fortress hedge fund manager said while big ideas — like new alternatives to animal meat and money — capture people's attention, they can also become drastically overbought.

""Beyond Meat reminds me a little bit of crypto in 2017,"" Novogratz told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. ""You get great bubbles on big ideas. This is a great bubble.""

The plant-based meat maker has been on a tear since its IPO in May. Last week, shares hit an all-time high of $208.48, a 720% rally since the IPO. But the hot streak snapped this week after the company posted mixed second-quarter earnings.

Shares continued to stumble Thursday, dropping 10%, after the company announced a secondary stock offering at $160 — an 18.6% discount from Wednesday's closing price. Beyond Meat plans to sell an additional 3.25 million shares with 3 million coming from investors and 250,000 from the company.

As more shares come on the market and the lock up period for employees ends, Novogratz predicts a steep decline in Beyond Meat's share price.

Much like bitcoin, Beyond Meat is trading at a ""ludicrous price, but everyone gets sucked in,"" said Novogratz, who is also a former Goldman Sachs macro trader.

""All the young guys on their Robinhood accounts are buying this. This is their crypto,"" he said.

Novogratz was an early bitcoin investor and started a cryptocurrency-focused merchant bank Galaxy Digital, which went public on a Canadian stock exchange last year during what many called ""crypto winter."" Cryptocurrency became a poster child for retail-driven bubbles after bitcoin rallied to almost $20,000 at the end of 2017, only to come crashing down the following year.

Bitcoin lost more than 70% of its value last year, and ended 2018 around $3,800. It was trading near $10,012 Thursday.

— CNBC's Jasmine Wu contributed reporting.",2019-08-01,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/08/01/534498.htm,"Britain’s markets watchdog said on Wednesday that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and offer consumers few protections, but added that such coins fall outside the scope of its powers.

The Financial Conduct Authority said crypto markets were highly dysfunctional, with the onus on consumers to understand the risks associated with investing in unregulated assets.

“A combination of market immaturity, volatility, and a lack of credible information or oversight raises concerns about market integrity, manipulation and insider dealing within cryptoasset markets,” the FCA said in a statement.

Despite those flaws, the FCA said existing rules did not apply to bitcoin and other tokens such as second-biggest coin ethereum, or to firms like exchanges and trading platforms.

The watchdog was laying out which aspects of the nascent crypto industry it regulates — a milestone in Britain’s regulation of a sector that still forms a tiny part of the broader financial system but which has attracted strong retail investor following.

“We have some concerns around some of the harms that consumers can be exposed to,” Nick Cook, FCA director of innovation, told Reuters, adding that investment by British consumers in crypto was still fairly low.

The FCA said its guidance will inform Britain’s finance ministry as it looks at whether new laws are needed for cryptocurrencies.

The finance ministry said in an emailed comment that the guidance was welcome and that it was planning to consult on unregulated cryptocurrencies later this year.

Retail investors across the world have been drawn to cryptocurrencies, highly volatile assets that unlike fiat money or other assets usually lack guarantees, because of their potential for quick gains.

Other proponents say digital coins could transform payments and how companies raise capital, though such examples are rare.

The treatment of cryptocurrencies by regulators is in focus after Facebook unveiled plans for its Libra coin, sparking a backlash by politicians and regulators across the globe.

G7 finance ministers and central bankers said last month that Libra and other digital currencies raise serious concerns and must be regulated as tightly as possible to ensure they do not upset the world’s financial system.

While the FCA did not mention Libra in its guidance, it said that some “stablecoins” — a form of cryptocurrency, like Libra, backed by assets such as fiat currencies — could fall under its rules in certain circumstances.

The FCA could not say how Libra would be treated because its structure, design and operating model were still to be determined, Cook said.

Other types of cryptocurrencies, such as security tokens — coins that provide rights and obligations such as shares or units in funds — were subject to rules, the FCA said. As such, firms issuing them would need authorisation.

CryptoUK, an industry body, called for further clarity.

“Britain’s cryptoasset sector is a key part of the UK fintech industry but needs regulatory certainty to reach its full potential,” chair Iqbal Gandham said in a statement.

Patchwork of Rules

Currently cryptocurrencies are subject to a patchwork of rules that vary from country to country.

Regulators in Britain, the European Union and the United States have looked at how they can apply existing securities, anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules before considering new regulation.

Others, such as China, have banned cryptocurrencies outright. An Indian government panel last week recommended a similar measure.

A handful of smaller countries, from Belarus to Bahrain, have come up with specific laws for digital currencies. Their efforts could help shape the development of the global market and the growth of industry players, from exchange platforms to brokers.

The FCA said it would work closely with other national and international regulators to coordinate approaches.

For now, said Bradley Rice, a lawyer at law firm Ashurst, there was little it could do within its existing powers.

“The FCA’s hands are tied. If the UK wants to bring more crypto assets into the regulatory net, the law has to be changed, and that is in the Treasury’s gift,” he said, referring to Britain’s finance ministry.

On August 1, it was discovered that the giant retail corporation Walmart has patented plans for a stablecoin that’s backed by U.S. dollars. If released into the wild, the USD-based cryptocurrency would be issued to select Walmart retailers and partners while the patent’s description explains the coin could be used outside of Walmart’s retail scope as well. Walmart’s patent follows Facebook’s recent Libra announcement and the ‘Walmart coin’ specifications are similar to the social media giant’s project as well.

Walmart Files Patent for a Digital Stablecoin Back by USD

Big-name corporations have been announcing the creation of their very own cryptocurrencies and the news has been a hot subject within the crypto community. It all started on June 18 when Facebook announced the launch of Libra, a stablecoin that will be available in Messenger, Whatsapp and as a standalone app, with the company expecting to launch the product in 2020. However, Facebook’s project riled up politicians and immediately got regulatory pushback from worldwide leaders and threats from U.S. congressional members.

Now Walmart is stepping into the ring to test its own blockchain technology as the company has filed a new digital currency patent that describes a stablecoin backed by USD. Walmart’s coin, if developed, could be easily be tested at its 11,368 hypermarkets, department stores and grocery clubs located in 27 countries. The Walmart coin was created by Robert Cantrell, David Nelms, John O’Brien, and Brian McHale. The patent’s abstract description states:

“[The] method includes: generating one digital currency unit by tying the one digital currency unit to a regular currency; storing information of the one digital currency unit into a block of a blockchain; buying or paying the one digital currency unit.”

“The digital currency may be pegged to the US dollar and available for use only at selected retailers or partners. In other embodiments, the digital currency is available for use anywhere. The digital currency can provide a fee-free, or fee-minimal place to store wealth that can be spent, for example, at retailers and, if needed, easily converted to cash,” Walmarts filing adds.

Walmart Coin Aims to Help Low-Income Households That Find Banking Expensive

A closer look at the filing shows that the Walmart coin concept offers a number of features like “pre-approved biometric (e.g., fingerprint or eye pattern) credit” and could store a user’s transaction history and give loyalty points. Much like Facebook’s Libra, the coin produced by Walmart aims to help low-income families worldwide. “Using a digital currency, low-income households that find banking expensive, may have an alternative way to handle wealth at an institution that can supply the majority of their day-to-day financial and product needs,” the Walmart filing details. “In some embodiments, retailers may be directly to aid organizations for assistance that may be used to provide goods. Retailers may tie into assistance that can provide vehicles or funding for vehicles to get goods to customers when the customers do not have sufficient mobility otherwise,” the patent reveals.

Is Walmart Coin the Corporation’s Second Attempt to Become a Bank?

The news comes years after Walmart attempted to become an industrial loan company (ILC) but got pushback from politicians and regulators. Bankers and anti-Walmart groups forced politicians to pass laws to stop Walmart in its tracks from opening bank branches. Because of the opposition, Walmart’s application filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) never gained traction.

Just like when Facebook announced Libra, congressional leaders scheduled two public hearings with Walmart over the ILC attempt. During the end of the debate against massive opposition, Walmart removed certain retail banking goals and focused solely on payment processing. Interestingly, the department store’s competitor Target was granted approval by the U.S. government to operate an ILC but skeptics think Walmart’s ILC idea was too broad. The Walmart ILC filing filed in 2005 sat with the FDIC until the corporation withdrew the request in March 2007. “We notified the FDIC today that Walmart has withdrawn the application we made in July 2005 for an Industrial Loan Company (ILC) charter,” the company revealed at the time.

Walmart’s latest patent filing could be another attempt to enter the banking ecosystem with a cryptocurrency instead of operating bank branches. The digital managing institution could be assigned to an independent third-party institution, Walmart’s filing highlights. Moreover, the Walmart coin could offer users interest applied to savings accounts, tied to the digital currency. “The savings can be greater when the customer buys goods that are on their shopping history and are therefore predicted,” the company patent notes, adding:

Savings further making the digital currency a more attractive option for customers, and overall creating a positive cascade.

Facebook and Walmart Coins That Have a Central Authority of Control Are No Threat to Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin

Of course, after the cryptocurrency community got wind of the Walmart coin patent filing the digital currency was compared to Facebook’s Libra attempt. Coincorner’s CEO Danny Scott doesn’t believe a Walmart cryptocurrency will be competitive against BTC. “Following the announcement of Facebook’s Libra in June, this news was certainly not unexpected – in fact, we expect to see more FAANG companies filing patents for their own cryptocurrencies in the coming months,” Scott wrote to news.Bitcoin.com. “However, while the publicity is obviously good news for the crypto industry, we believe it is a waste of time and resources for these companies – something that will eventually show as time passes,” the CEO added. Scott further stated:

There are already a number of decent stablecoins out there, all doing exactly the same job. The likes of Walmart or Facebook are not bringing anything new to the table, they are just hoping that with a household name behind it, their coin will naturally succeed and become the default choice.

Scott thinks that since the Libra announcement the coin has “opened a can of worms with regards to regulatory concerns” and the company recently admitted the project may not continue because of the regulatory climate. The Coincorner CEO says that Walmart’s attempt will be no different, and to him it doesn’t matter how big and influential these corporations are, the executive opined. “We remain unconcerned with regards to the risk that “Facebook Coin” or “Walmart Coin” or “The Next Big Company Coin” pose a threat to Bitcoin,” Scott stated. “No matter how big the name behind these coins, for as long as there is a central authority with control, Bitcoin has no competition.”

While a patent shows Walmart is thinking about the concept of introducing a cryptocurrency, it hasn’t officially announced making a coin as Facebook did. Crypto spectators and financial pundits will be monitoring Walmart’s idea, but for now the concept is in its very early stages as a simple patent filing. Just as President Donald Trump warned Facebook, it’s likely U.S. bureaucrats will expect Walmart to apply for a federal banking charter if it follows through with producing the patent invention.

What do you think about Walmart possibly creating its own cryptocurrency? Do you think the company will get pushback from bankers and regulators like Facebook did? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

""Cryptocurrencies have a big future,"" Bannon told CNBC on Friday. ""They could be a very important part going forward, particularly in this global populist revolt.""

As an owner of bitcoin, Bannon said he had ""enough foresight, enough courage to buy as it went all the way down.""

Bannon has generally towed the Trump line on hot-button issues since his departure as White House chief strategist in August 2017, not even a year after the presidential inauguration.

Last month, after Facebook's June announcement of its Libra digital currency effort, Trump tweeted, ""I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air."" He added, ""Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior.""

Bannon said that governments, central banks and the banking industry want to ""stay with fiat currency"" so it's no surprise that they ""get in there and regulate crypto."" Fiat currency is legal money backed by governments.

Unlike the decentralized nature of bitcoin, Libra will be pegged to a basket of government-backed money.

As part of his July cryptocurrency diatribe — and ahead of contentious Libra hearings on Capitol Hill — Trump said Facebook's Libra ""will have little standing or dependability,"" adding that if the social media giant wants to become a bank it should seek a banking charter.

Bannon sees Libra a bit differently, acting in practice as more of a competitor to mobile payment systems that already exist than traditional cryptos like bitcoin. The Facebook effort is ""principally against"" some of the major Chinese companies offering their own payment systems such as Alipay that was created by Alibaba and WeChat Pay from Tencent.

""I think what people need to confront now and people start looking at, is how the Chinese and Third World countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in South Asia and I think potentially in South America, are starting to put these payment systems in that are going to kind of give them, try to give them, global dominance and be able to get off the reserve currency of the dollar,"" Bannon said.",2019-08-02,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-goldman-sachs-consumers-crypto-idUSKCN1US2K6,"FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is displayed onstage before a product unveiling event at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California October 4, 2011.

(Reuters) - The Apple Inc AAPL.O credit card being launched with Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N will not allow the purchase of cryptocurrencies with the card, according to a customer agreement posted to Goldman's website on Friday.

The Apple Card customer agreement said the card cannot be used to purchase cash advances or cash equivalents that include cryptocurrencies, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or lottery tickets. Goldman declined to comment and Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Apple Card is part of a broader effort by Apple to derive more of its revenue from services after years of heavily reliance on iPhone sales, which declined 12% in the most recent quarter.

For Goldman’s part, the Apple partnership is part of the longtime investment bank’s effort to build out a consumer-facing business.

Apple and Goldman are not alone in banning the purchase of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin with credit cards. Major American and British banks Lloyds Banking Group Plc LLOY.L and Virgin Money VM.L banned such purchases here last year, following the lead of U.S. banking giants JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Citigroup C.N.

Many of us have been guilty of confusing these two terms and using them interchangeably. But even though their meanings overlap in a number of areas, and even though they've both reached similar levels of public notoriety since the 2017 cryptocurrency bull market, they aren't quite identical.

Yes, they both generally refer to a record of information that's distributed across a network, and yes, they both foster a greater degree of transparency and openness than had been enabled by earlier, centralized databases or digital records. But this is where the analogies end, since blockchains and distributed ledger technology (DLT) each come with their own important distinguishing features.

Openness, decentralization, cryptography

There are two big distinctions, and depending on where you sit on the Bitcoin vs. blockchain spectrum, some qualify Bitcoin-style blockchains as largely superior to and more innovative than their distributed ledger counterparts while others qualify DLT as more useful for everyday commercial purposes.

The illustration below outlines how the two technologies relate to each other, showing that one way to implement DLT is through a blockchain:

Firstly, blockchains are generally public, meaning that anyone can view their transaction histories and that anyone can participate in their operations by becoming a node. They are, as cryptocurrency parlance puts it, “permissionless.” This is the key feature pointed out to Cointelegraph by Marta Piekarska, the director of ecosystem at Hyperledger. According to Piekarska:

“First and foremost: one is permission less, the other is permissioned. This means that in the first case anyone can participate in the network, in the other: only chosen participants have access to it. This also determined the size of the network: Bitcoin wants to grow infinitely, while in a permissioned blockchain space, the number of parties is smaller.”

Put simply, the public aspect of blockchains generally implies three interrelated things: 1) Anyone can use the blockchain, 2) anyone can serve as a validating node of the blockchain, and 3) anyone who becomes a node can, in turn, act as part of that blockchain's governance mechanism. In theory, this makes blockchains decentralized and democratic structures resistant to undue control or influence from any single party.

By contrast, a distributed ledger generally doesn't enable any or most of these public features. It restricts who can use and access it (hence the “permissioned” terminology), and it also restricts who can operate as a node. And in many cases, governance decisions are left to a single centralized company or body. Compared to the ideal of a public, decentralized blockchain, it exists solely to serve the interests of a concentrated group of commercial players and interests.

Below is an image detailing how centralized, decentralized and distributed networks are structured:

And then there's the second main difference. As the name implies, blockchains consist in a series of time-stamped “blocks” that record the then-current state of the overall blockchain/cryptocurrency and that need to be cryptographically validated by a majority of the network in order to form the next entry in the chain. As Bitcoin Core developer Kalle Alm explained to Cointelegraph, this ensures a greater level of security for the blockchain, insofar as the need for cryptographic consensus makes it very difficult to fake transactions. Alm went on to say:

""Blockchains alleviate the trust requirement in a shared timestamped database. For a public cryptocurrency, this is obviously necessary or someone might just go and give themselves a million USD, but for a private database, especially when it is not a cryptocurrency but some more abstract form of smart contract platform, it starts to make less and less sense.""

However, while some distributed ledgers aren’t cryptographically validated chains of blocks, it’s worth stressing that some are — or that they still feature cryptographic consensus. For instance, while R3’s Corda ledger doesn’t actually comprise a chain of blocks, it nonetheless relies on its notaries (i.e., nodes) reaching consensus over time-stamped transactions. Because of this, it should be emphasized that there’s really only one essential difference between blockchains and distributed ledgers, which is simply that one is permissionless and the other is permissioned. Michal Zajda, the blockchain architect at Aeternity blockchain, told Cointelegraph:

“The only difference between private and public blockchains is the range of availability. I can easily imagine deploying the Bitcoin protocol in a private cloud serving just a small group of users. The fundamental difference here is between permissionless blockchains — like Bitcoin, and permissioned ones. For permissionless ones, we do not need to trust any third party company to run it fairly and honestly.”

But assuming that a distributed ledger is private and isn't a time-stamped chain of blocks that results from cryptographic consensus, it often just amounts to a fairly conventional database that just happens to be shared among a select group of participants. This is the point made by Phil Chen, the decentralized chief officer at HTC Exodus. He told Cointelegraph that the difference between public and private blockchains is vast:

""In the enterprise space, people are talking about private blockchains, which technically are not blockchains but a better database management system. Nevertheless, it does have productivity gains; I call it a 9 to 10 innovation, whereas public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are 0 to 1 innovations that completely change the way we think and use money and computation. Bitcoin is a true public blockchain that is open, neutral, censorship resistant and borderless. And distributed ledgers are simply permissioned databases.""

Privacy, scalability

But as Chen's explanation indicates, even though blockchains are arguably superior to distributed ledgers, DLT can still be a useful addition to the global economy's technological arsenal, particularly in cases in which it would be unwise to harness a truly public and decentralized blockchain. Alm added that:

""The strongest argument for a private blockchain seems to be when a bunch of banks get together to create a system for transferring money between each other. In this case, no bank would be content letting any of the other banks 'maintain' the database on their own, so a shared blockchain controlled by no one would make sense.""

Added to this, the privacy of private ledgers is an obvious benefit for any company protective of its business or customer data. Still, the chief commercial officer at the Energy Web Foundation, Jesse Morris, contends that, even here, the privacy of public blockchains can actually be much stronger than some people realize. He told Cointelegraph that:

""A common criticism of public chains has to do with privacy (e.g., the details of every transaction are known to all). This criticism does not recognize two simple facts: 1) any dApp can shield certain transactional details by only transmitting the bare minimum of information necessary across any blockchain while keeping sensitive data off-chain and 2) even in private networks, privacy-preserving features are applied to protect sensitive information from participants on a private blockchain, and these same privacy preservation measures (e.g. EY Nightfall, other zero knowledge proofs) are beginning to be utilized on public blockchains as well.""

In other words, there is a recognition that public blockchains potentially offer many of the privacy benefits promised by their more private rivals, and then some. Of course, private ledgers still generally have the advantage of being controlled by the companies that use them — and for big multinational banks that want to have control over their processes, this is obviously a big plus.

There's also the very salient benefit of improved scalability, since, as mentioned above, distributed ledgers are often shared yet largely centralized databases. As such, they can process hundreds — if not thousands — of transactions per second, while decentralized blockchains such as Bitcoin struggle to top seven transactions per second, all the while consuming vast quantities of electricity. This is perhaps the main benefit offered by distributed ledgers, and even if they don't offer much decentralization and transparency beyond previous database systems, it's one reason why they'll continue being used in the future.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/leicester-city-fc-renews-partnership-with-crypto-investment-platform,"On Aug. 2, English Premier League football club Leicester City FC announced the renewal of its partnership with multi-asset and cryptocurrency investment platform eToro.

The Foxes’ head of partnerships Harj Hir added:

“Our relationship with eToro last season was a really positive one so we’re pleased to renew the partnership and continue our work with such an exciting, innovative industry leader. The global reach of eToro is huge and we hope to further strengthen our relations with them as we embark on our second season together in 2019/20.”

Per the press release, “a landmark sponsorship deal was signed by the Football Club and e-Toro at the start of the 2018/19 campaign, which saw the company become an Official Club Partner while the agreement was the Premier League’s first deal paid using Bitcoin (BTC)”.

Cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming more common in sports

According to eToro’s UK managing director Iqbal V. Gandham, currently the platform is “working with six clubs for the second year in a row.” On Aug. 1, Everton Football Club of the British Premier League has also signed a deal with the crypto-inclusive investment and trading platform eToro.

Blockade Games announced on July 31 that it has successfully bridged the two networks by sending a bitcoin lightning transaction in such a way that it can cause an ethereum smart contract to run.

The company has run its code on the Rinkeby testnet and plans to deploy it on mainnet (using real ether) in the next couple of weeks, Blockade Games CTO Ben Heidorn told CoinDesk.

All of these tests feed into plans to add lightning network support to Neon District, its upcoming role-playing game built on top of ethereum.

Heidorn explained in a new blog post released Wednesday that it moved forward with the test is because it believes both bitcoin and ethereum will play an important role in the future. (The company believes ethereum, in particular, is the future of “non-fungible assets,” or digital assets that are provably unique from all the others).

The blog post goes on:

“We also believe that bitcoin is the future of money, and many of our players will prefer to hold most, if not all, of their funds in bitcoin. We want to make it possible to serve our biggest supporters and players on the bitcoin network while utilizing all of the infrastructure present on ethereum and other blockchain networks.”

As such, they want users to be able to send lightning bitcoin payments to trigger ethereum events.

“By integrating bitcoin lightning network payments, we are able to accept instant payments in bitcoin directly, and instantaneously kick off a series of events on any other chain, such as minting a brand new Neon District asset to a buyer’s ethereum or Loom Network wallet,” the blog continues.

The code for this unique type of lightning transaction is not yet public, but “we will open it once we’re sure it’s ready and secure for people to pull down and use,” Heidorn told CoinDesk.

Regarding the frequent tension between bitcoin and ethereum enthusiasts, Heidorn argued that the two cryptocurrencies are “two sides of the same coin,” adding:

“When it comes down to individuals maintaining sovereignty, privacy and autonomy, especially as crypto grows in popularity and faces greater social and political attacks, the infighting will be a thing of the past.”

Its original creators, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, wanted to create a cryptocurrency that wasn’t as stuffy or boring as Bitcoin. They wanted to create a digital coin that was fun, in the hope that it would appeal to a much broader audience than conventional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Anyone that’s been involved in cryptocurrency for more than a few months will almost certainly have heard of Dogecoin. And if you’ve ever been on the internet, you’ll probably recognize the Shiba Inu “doge” that acts as the Dogecoin mascot.

Sure, Dogecoin might play on the popular internet “doge” meme, but when it comes to cryptocurrency, it’s a serious project.

Dogecoin was originally based on LuckyCoin which is essentially a variation of the Litecoin code, which is itself derived from Bitcoin. Dogecoin uses a similar mining algorithm to Litecoin, called Scrypt. As a result, Dogecoin has smaller block times compared to Bitcoin. The Scrypt algorithm also makes it more difficult to use specialist ASIC mining equipment to mine the coins.

Though it’s not all fun and games for Dogecoin. Back in 2014, the coin was used to successfully raise $25,000 for the Jamaican bobsleigh team to get them to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. It’s the stuff worthy of a movie deal.

One of the main differences between Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, is that it’s inflationary. While there are only 21 million Bitcoins that will ever be mined, Dogecoin has no limit. According to CoinMarketCap, there are over 120 billion Dogecoins in circulation, at the time of writing.

Let’s take a look at how those Dogecoins have performed over the last quarter, but first, a quick recap of how it performed in previous years.

Dogecoin/USD historic performance recap

For two years between July 2015 and March 2017, Dogecoin traded between $0.0001 and $0.0004, with little variation. As with most other cryptocurrencies though, Dogecoin experienced its most notable price increases between mid-2017 to early 2018.

At the end of May 2017, Dogecoin’s trading price rose from $0.001066 on May 16 to $0.003747 on May 23, a 251-percent increase. By late September of the same year, the coin’s trading price fell back towards $0.001134. It continued trading around this price until late November when the coin began to grow towards its biggest rally to date.

Dogecoin reached its all time high price during the cryptocurrency boom across the winter of 2017 to 2018. On January 7, 2018, Dogecoin was trading at $0.017491, a staggering 1,442% up on where it was trading a couple of months earlier.

As was the case with other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin’s prices fell sharply as 2018 progressed. There were two brief rallies which saw Dogecoin’s price increase noteworthy amounts. The first came in April when Doge’s price jumped from $0.002708 to $0.005868. The second came in late August when Doge’s price jumped from $0.002321 to $0.006575 over a two-week period.

Ultimately though, Dogecoin ended 2018 a long way down from the high is saw in early January. On December 20, 2018 the cryptocurrency was trading at just $0.002360, 86-percent down on its lifetime high seen in January.

Dogecoin/USD Q2

Dogecoin has shown few signs of ever reaching a trading price like it did during the 2017/2018 boom: since late last year through the first quarter of 2019 it has traded around $0.002. However, at the start of April, Dogecoin’s trading price started heading skyward. It has been on the up, slowly, ever since.

Credit: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin Q2 April performance

On the last day of Q1, Dogecoin was trading at $0.002075; over the next four days its price rose to $0.003854. This upward trend was seen across numerous cryptocurrency markets. Unfortunately, it was swiftly followed by a correction that saw Doge’s price drop to $0.002873. A notable decrease from its early quarter high, but still 38-percent up on where it opened the quarter.

Dogecoin had two notable rallies in Q2, the first came in mid-May and saw the cryptocurrency’s price rise from $0.002480 on May 10 to $0.003388 on May 16. However, within 24 hours Doge’s price dropped by 16 percent to $0.002849.

Credit: CoinMarketCap Dogecoin Q2 mid-May performance

The second rally came at the end of May, when the coin’s price rose from $0.002968 to $0.003578. As ever, this rally was followed by a dip which saw Dogecoin’s price drop to $0.003010 on June 6.

All these price rises and sudden drops might seem less than stellar for the long term outlook of the coin. However, stepping back and examining Dogecoin’s growth over the entire quarter will be more pleasing to long term holders of the asset.

It may have had its ups and downs this quarter, but Dogecoin started April trading around $0.002086 and ended the quarter at $0.003356, a strong 60-percent increase over the three-month period.

Major events in Q2



As you might suspect, Dogecoin is never far from the meme culture from which it was born. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it maintains interest in the coin and keeps conversations fun and lighthearted. After all, that’s what its creators set out to do.

At the start of April, shortly before the coin‘s major rally of the quarter, Tesla’s head honcho Elon Musk said that Dogecoin was his favorite cryptocurrency. He even changed his Twitter bio to read “CEO of Dogecoin,” it was changed shortly after to “retired CEO of Dogecoin.” Even Musk isn’t above the meme. Whatever the case, Musk’s musings certainly seemed to stir some extra interest in the cryptocurrency.

In more serious news, Doge was listed on Huobi – one of the world’s top 10 cryptocurrency exchanges by reported volume – in April. According to CoinMarketCap, Huobi is one of the top 20 markets for Doge (at the time of writing).

Doge was listed on Huobi on April 4, the day that the coin’s price started retreating from its early quarter high. Seemingly, the anticipation and speculation in the days prior to this listing served as a greater boon to the coin’s price than the actual listing did itself.

Rumors were also afloat that another of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, would be listing Doge in the near future. In early July, Binance confirmed rumors and listed Dogecoin, according to a support statement. Doge’s price pumped afterwards and had given a good start to Q3 for the cryptocurrency.

Looking forward to Q3 for Dogecoin

Indeed, Dogecoin getting listed on more exchanges can only be a good thing (assuming those exchanges aren’t ever hacked for Doge).

The meme-based cryptocurrency will have a long way to go if it is to maintain the strength it has shown in the most recent quarter. Given that in the months prior to Q2, Doge had shown few signs of life since the famous 2017 bull run.

But given Doge’s strong, but perhaps a little volatile, second quarter, the short term prognosis is looking good. Presuming it can maintain the interest that has fueled some of its latest rallies, Dogecoin looks many positive, much hodl, very good.",2019-08-02,https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-to-chase-buying-crypto-on-credit-not-necessarily-a-cash-advance,"Southern District of New York Judge Katherine Polk Failla has ruled that purchasing cryptocurrency with a Chase Bank credit card does not necessarily count as a cash advance, as per Chase’s contract.

According to an opinion and order document dated August 1, Judge Failla has denied Chase’s motion to dismiss a number of the plaintiff’s complaints, which center on the bank charging a user cash advance fees for buying cryptocurrency with a Chase credit card.

The plaintiffs are Brady Tucker, Ryan Hilton and Stanton Smith, who have brought a class action suit against banking giant Chase.

In the document, Failla summarized their class action suit as follows:

“This claim — indeed, the entirety of Plaintiffs’ suit — is built on an argument that acquisitions of cryptocurrency could not be classified as cash advances within the meaning of the Contracts. [...] Chase disagrees, claiming that cryptocurrency acquisitions are ‘cash-like transactions’ pursuant to the Contracts, and thus cash advances. The parties’ dispute thus boils down to a difference of opinion concerning the proper interpretation of the term ‘cash-like transaction.’”

The reason that a number of Chase’s dismissal motions have not gone through is because Judge Failla believes that the plaintiffs have provided a reasonable interpretation of the term “cash-like transaction” in the context of Chase’s contract.

As Failla also explains in the document, the plaintiffs are interpreting the word cash as referring only to fiat money, and cash-like as referring only to legally-recognized claims on cash — such as checks, money orders, and wire transfers, and notably not cryptocurrency. The defendants, on the other hand, believe that the term cash-like transactions applies to any means of payment, cryptocurrency-based or otherwise.

Notably, Judge Failla has not sided with the plaintiffs and said that their interpretation is correct. Rather, Failla has simply noted that their interpretation is plausible enough for them to proceed with their class action case. Failla wrote:",

You also won’t be able to use the Apple Card to buy lottery tickets, casino gambling chips in any form, physical or virtual, or foreign currency or travelers checks.

Reuters spotted the detail in a customer agreement posted to Apple Card’s card issuer partner Goldman Sachs’ website which lists restrictions on transactions it describes as “cash advance and cash equivalents”.

The agreement defines these as meaning “any cash advance and other cash-like transaction, including purchases of cash equivalents such as travelers checks, foreign currency, or cryptocurrency; money orders; peer to peer transfers, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions; lottery tickets, casino gaming chips (whether physical or digital), or race track wagers or similar betting transactions”.

Given the wild swings in crypto valuations the Apple+Goldman credit tie-up saying a firm ‘no’ to cardholders splashing on such shaky stuff is hardly surprising.

Apple announced it was getting into the credit card game back in March, saying the card would offer a 2% cash back incentive for using Apple Pay to make purchases. (The physical version of the Apple Card is slightly less generous vs the digital card.) While if you’re buying stuff direct from Apple there’s 3% cash-back.

There are also no late fees and no penalty rates. Interest rates for Apple Card are in the range of 13-24%, based on the user’s creditworthiness.

As with Apple Pay, there’s a privacy promise too — with a pledge that Apple Card transaction data won’t be sold for advertising or marketing, not by Apple, Goldman or any other partners. Though data may be shared with regulators for financial reporting purposes and so on.

Celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Bretton Woods conference is probably not high on the list of priorities for cryptocurrency enthusiasts this month. This is an understandable oversight – the price swings, confusing product launches and whereabouts of Justin Sun are perhaps more compelling.

But the birth of international economic cooperation and interoperability should be recognized as the beginning of a process of economic reconstruction that has contributed to the global imbalances worrying the markets today. It could also have set the scene for the solution.

The bulk of the U.S. stock market may be overvalued, and yields look set to go even lower – but a large part of the current strain lurks under the surface of the currency market. A combination of monetary easing, trade tensions and the threat of military action in the Middle East is a noxious cocktail for currency holders and hedgers as international conversions get risky and costly.

Perhaps because of this, as well as the disquieting brandishing of financial muscle by the U.S. administration, the chorus of questions about the role of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency is getting louder.

What’s more, it has held its leadership role for almost 100 years; the average global reserve currency lifespan over the past five centuries is 95 years. Shifting balances are hinting that the dollar’s reign may soon be up: its share of foreign exchange reserves is over 60%, while the weight of the U.S. economy in global output has fallen to less than 25 percent and is likely to continue trending lower.

Encroaching currency competition could well gather momentum as politics starts to trump economics.

Some have posited that there is a “non-zero chance” that bitcoin would make a great reserve currency. I disagree, I believe that there is exactly zero chance that could happen. I do think, however, that the global reserve system will radically change over the next couple of decades. Bitcoin could be a part of what emerges.

What gives?

First, some background on the significance of Bretton Woods and why we should be paying attention.

In 1944, an agreement was drawn up between delegates from 44 nations that established the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, which would be pegged to gold. The other member nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar, and the resulting relative stability between denominations would smooth world trade and boost the post-war recovery.

The agreement also created the institutions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to coordinate global currency movements and channel loans to developing nations.

The U.S. dollar stopped “officially” being the global reserve currency when President Richard Nixon took the country off the gold standard in 1971. It remained the de-facto global reserve currency, however, by dint of being the world’s largest economy and trading nation. Countries tended to hold more dollar reserves than all other foreign currencies combined, for the ease of transacting and for their relative stability.

Being the global reserve currency is a mixed blessing. While it makes it easy to borrow in international markets, it takes away power to influence the domestic economy.

If foreign debt holders start to believe that President Trump might encourage a devaluation of the U.S. dollar (as he has often hinted he wants to do), they would start to unload, as a devaluation would make their bonds worth less. Foreign holdings of U.S. debt currently amount to over $6 trillion, almost 30% of the outstanding total, so even a small unloading would be a shock to the market and would weaken the dollar’s credibility for some time to come.

As well as not being able to devalue when convenient, the additional global demand for U.S. dollars stemming from its reserve currency status is keeping the dollar’s value high relative to other currencies, exacerbating the current account deficit, now the largest in the world. And, whatever your views on Modern Monetary Theory (which posits, among other things, that debt levels don’t matter), the vulnerability of the U.S. markets to foreign investment strategies is disquieting.

So much for “America First.”

A new reserve currency?

Given the growing doubts over the need for and advisability of a fiat-based, single-issuer global reserve currency, you can see why the bitcoin narrative would pop up. Surely a sovereign-free, algorithm-based alternative would be more stable and trustworthy?

Perhaps, but it won’t be bitcoin*.

First, a global currency needs to have a flexible supply. The limits on the amount of gold banks could hold was one of the main reasons the gold standard didn’t work – economic growth outstripped the supply of gold-backed money, and the inevitable scramble to overcome this limitation led to destabilization.

Second, bitcoin will not become a universal settlement token for trading contracts. It’s too volatile. While this should soften in line with greater liquidity, it’s unlikely that businesses and sovereign powers will give up their preference for fiat, which they have some control over.

So, if not bitcoin, then what? What could an international trading currency that embodies both trustworthiness and flexibility look like?

Drawing table

One such model is Facebook’s Libra: a basket of currencies and government debt that is periodically rebalanced and used to peg a digital token that can be used for settlement.

But the whirlwind of debate around the coin’s purpose and backing has highlighted the strong distrust of corporate motives with global ambitions, and the simmering anti-trust scrutiny will make it difficult for any large enterprise to create a universal solution.

Another such model, much more likely, is a revamped Special Drawing Right (SDR). This basket of currencies was created by the IMF in 1969 to act as a private transaction token and a “store of value” for members. Its value moves in line with that of the underlying currencies: the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, euro, British pound and Chinese renminbi.

Several economists have proposed the expansion of the SDR’s scope for purposes of international trade, positioning it as a global reserve currency that does not depend on any one issuer and can be managed by a neutral, supra-national organization with economic stability as its main objective.

The problem is, even a liquid SDR in its current configuration would be subject to national priorities and vulnerabilities. A sharp depreciation in the U.S. dollar as central banks switch to the SDR as a reserve holding could destabilize the basket. The euro is almost as significant as a global payment currency but carries an existential risk, however remote. The Chinese renminbi is still largely controlled by its government, and the British pound’s future is uncertain.

If only the SDR in its new liquid form could be pegged to a non-sovereign token of exchange that is totally free from political manipulation. You see where I’m going with this?

Other currencies would also form part of the basket, to reflect economic activity and allow flexibility in the supply. But a robust apolitical anchor could add a layer of trust, difficult to come by in an increasingly fractious trade environment.

Time to talk

How this mechanism would work, I don’t know – it would no doubt be complex and fraught with controversy, and anyone who studies currencies is aware of the colossal complications of maintaining a peg. But the building conviction that the current system is flawed and the increasingly apparent politicization of currencies will eventually shift the conversation from “it’s too difficult to attempt” to “let’s start talking about this.”

The biggest risk to the world economy right now is not trade tensions, overvalued assets or negative yields. It’s complacency in assuming that the status quo will hold. Profound change always costs a massive amount of political and economic capital, but it happens regardless.

None of us can be sure what the next step of financial evolution will look like – but we’ll soon find out. As economist Tyler Cowen reminds us in a recent article: “Every era’s monetary institutions are virtually unimaginable until they are created.”

Unfortunately, even getting the main participants to the table to discuss this will be a mammoth task. The Bretton Woods’ anniversary celebrations have given voice to papers and panels questioning the current reserve system, the role of the IMF and how to weather the economic storms ahead. Ideas and discussions are a start. But we shouldn’t forget that in 1944, just after the bloodiest war in history, what brought the participants to the table in a collaborative frame of mind was fear.

We can all fervently hope that it doesn’t take that level of fear to get everyone to the table again. What is different this time around is that the need for a reform is becoming startlingly apparent. The discussions are involving a much broader set of participants. And bitcoin is adding a new tool to the box of potential solutions.

On its own, it won’t solve the most pressing issues. But combined with other tools, and aided by diplomacy, academic rigor and patience, it could well form an integral part of a new type of reserve currency, which could help smooth or even avoid the shocks to come.

More than half the year is behind us and the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to move forward, showing relentless growth over the last six months. 2019 has also seen a new theme arise as speculators believe the cryptocurrency ecosystem is experiencing an influx of institutional interest and regulatory crackdowns. A variety of cryptocurrency research reports analyzing the first two quarters of the year show the space has seen a lot of growth, despite regulatory headwinds.

The Cryptoconomy 2019: Institutionalization, Facebook and Exchange Tokens

Coinshares and cryptocurrency corporation Circle have recently published very detailed research reports concerning the digital asset space over the last six months. Over the last few weeks, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has ranged between $250-300 billion. The U.K.-based firm Coinshares’ H1 report says that the last six months should be considered a net positive for the young industry. “The continuing professionalisation of the protocol services and corresponding technologies has been impressive and most assets have reacted by recovering substantially from last year’s brutal bear market,” explains Coinshares’ H1 study. It notes that there’s been “no shortage of speculation” when it comes to people guessing what’s driving the rally.

The research also shows that retail interest in BTC is “relatively tepid compared to 2017.” This makes Coinshares’ believe the H1 recovery was “largely driven by the long-awaited entrance of institutional money.” The firm says that the company’s sales division has “anecdotal evidence” that supports the institutionalization theory. Coinshares mentions financial incumbents like Fidelity and the Intercontinental Exchange (Bakkt) as institutional examples. Moreover, in terms of legitimizing the industry, the company’s report also highlights Facebook’s Libra coin attempt. The report’s authors opine that even though the digital currency may be centralized, it could be beneficial.

“While Libra is centralised, permissioned, trust-based, not censorship-resistant, not scarce, and arguably not even a cryptocurrency at all (though this term is poorly defined),” Coinshares’ H1 report notes. “It does offer potential benefits to the world’s unbanked that currently don’t have access to services we take for granted in the West, such as online shopping.”

Record Open Interest and Volumes in CME Bitcoin Derivatives and Defining Crypto Regulations

Circle’s 80-page report is far more in-depth, and also notices the growth of institutionalization within the crypto space. The company’s research says that some notable signs of institutional interest stem from data like inflows into Grayscale’s products and CME’s futures open interest and trade volumes reaching all-time highs. To Circle’s researchers covering 2019’s Q2, the announcement from Facebook was a watershed moment for some people although others have been skeptical. As far as stablecoins are concerned, the company said it witnessed its own USDC regulated stablecoin market cap rise a great deal.

“Grayscale recently provided a second-quarter update, showcasing continued strength since market lows at the end of 2018,” Circle’s report notes when researching the distinguishing signs of institutionalization. “Assets under management were up 125% quarter over quarter (q/q), driven by an increase in underlying prices, among other factors. The portion of inflows from institutional investors has been experiencing step function growth, rising from 59% in 3Q18 to 84% in 2Q19 — Grayscale notes this figure was dominated by hedge funds.”

As far as CME Bitcoin futures interest, Circle notes that Gareth MacLeod, partner at Gryphon Labs, suggested that the recent surge in CME’s crypto futures volumes is likely due to “traditional finance taking a greater interest in bitcoin.” Circle’s research also claims that defining regulatory developments may be strengthening institutionalization within the cryptoconomy.

The report shows established regulatory changes like the SEC’s framework for investment contracts (April 3), China’s proposed ban on crypto mining (April 9), Ohio representative Warren Davidson reintroducing the “Token Taxonomy Act” (April 9), NY’s Attorney General announced investigating Ifinex (April 26), FinCEN issuing guidance on BSAs and digital currencies (May 9), the SEC postponing Vaneck/Solidx ETF (May 20), IRS announcing new tax guidelines for cryptos (May 16), and the Egyptian central bank proposing digital currency regulatory action (May 29). Other regulation topics include the SEC’s action against the Kik initial coin offering (ICO), India’s recent crypto discussions, the G7 taskforce, and the recent A+ token offerings granted approval by the SEC in mid-July.

Crypto Funding Gathers New Tailwinds, Noncustodial Trade Volumes Increase, and Lightning and Maker Network Usage Declines

After the rise and fall of ICOs, the new trend Circle sees is the “rise of exchange tokens.” Exchange tokens are sold similarly to ICOs but are exclusively used on the trading platform for various benefits like discounted trading fees, rewards, governance systems, and token burns. The researcher highlights 2019’s prominent exchange tokens including Binance (BNB), Huobi (HT), Coinflex (FLEX), and the LEO token launched by Bitfinex. Even though these tokens are slightly different to the prior ICO model, Circle researchers say that the issuers may face regulatory hurdles. “A major challenge that exchange tokens face is around how they should be classified by regulators — as utility tokens or security tokens,” the authors of Circle’s Q2 study remark.

2019 saw a bunch of seed funding rounds and venture investments into crypto-based companies according to Circle’s study. This includes startups like Sparkswap ($3.5 million), Cambridge Blockchain ($3.5 million), Flexa ($14.1 million), Chainalysis ($6 million), and Celo ($25 million). The 80-page report also underlines subjects like the number of funds involved in cryptocurrency staking. According to Circle’s study, there’s $6.5 billion worth of digital assets locked up in (proof-of-stake) staking networks. Circle notes that the increase of staking this year is driven partly by projects like Cosmos and V Systems.

Additionally, Circle measured the activity of decentralized applications (dapps) and found there were +43 added per month in 2019 on Ethereum and +16 on the EOS network. Circle’s research also shows that there’s been increasing trade volumes on noncustodial exchanges as this metric has increased by 32% q/q. During the first week of June, Bitcoin.com recently launched a peer-to-peer, noncustodial BCH marketplace called Local.Bitcoin.com, adding another option to the slew of accessible noncustodial platforms introduced in 2019. Additionally, the report explains that there’s been an activity decline on both the Lightning Network on BTC and the declining dominance of ETH locked into the Maker contract.

Overall, both reports show there’s been a lot of cryptocurrency activities and positive outlooks throughout H1 and a good score of steady growth increases quarter over quarter. Coinshare’s report underscores that “nothing is certain in this space and things often feel like they move at a breakneck pace.” However, the company looks forward to seeing what the next half of the year brings. Circle’s research also shows a net positive for 2019’s Q2 and it will be interesting to see if the cryptoconomy’s action and the underlying network development behind these projects continue to rise in H2.

As peer-to-peer cash, it only seems logical that cryptocurrency should be deployed for P2P lending. While that application has taken time to materialize, bitcoin and other crypto assets are now increasingly fulfilling that purpose. Across the BTC, BCH and ETH networks, credit is being supplied to ordinary citizens while bypassing its traditional gatekeepers, usurping the authority of banks and credit agencies in the process.

The Evolution of Crypto Lending

P2P lending enables individuals and businesses to borrow money from one another. Facilitating this process has traditionally called for a middleman, known as a lending platform, to bring the counterparties together and custody the deal. For SMEs that have struggled to obtain credit through traditional means, P2P lending can be a lifeline, but it is one that can come at a high cost: lending platforms are known to levy significant fees, over and above those awarded to the lender.

The maturation of crypto assets has not rendered lending platforms redundant, but it has allowed for greater efficiencies, resulting in a better deal for both counterparties. Cryptocurrencies don’t just minimize the fees accrued by middlemen, which in this case are typically levied by the lending protocol: they also allow for new forms of digital assets to be collateralized, opening the door to possibilities that are not available within the legacy P2P system.

Finwhalex Conceives New Forms of Crypto Collateral

Finwhalex is a blockchain-based credit platform that’s devised a new collateralization system that allows Steam gaming assets to be swapped for cryptocurrency. With 10 million daily users and $4.3 billion in revenue, Steam is the largest gaming platform in the world. Finwhalex is applying the finishing touches to a system for integrating virtual assets into its collateralized system, enabling Steam users to unlock their illiquid gaming assets.

For digital natives, accustomed to working, living and playing online, swapping non-fungible digital assets for fungible ones such as bitcoin comes naturally. It’s just one of the many ways that P2P lending protocols are deriving liquidity from assets that the legacy financial system has refused to acknowledge, yet which hold significant untapped value.

Maker Dai CDPs Go Through the Roof

Meanwhile, the number of collateralized debt positions (CDP) in the Maker ecosystem has exploded over the last month, resulting in the issuance of $77 million worth of dai stablecoins. Much of this capital is locked into lending protocols that enable businesses and individuals to obtain a stable form of working capital without needing to sell their crypto assets – ETH in this case. The proliferation of CDPs in July, a 29X increase on the month prior, is thanks to an Earn.com campaign that encourages users to generate dai through locking ethereum within their Coinbase wallet.

Six of the top 10 dapps listed on defi.pulse are for lending protocols, with the Maker system followed by Compound, a money market protocol that allows anyone to supply assets to a liquidity pool in exchange for continuously-compounding interest. Rates adjust automatically based on supply and demand. $97 million is presently locked into Compound, followed by Instadapp, with $29 million. Built on top of the Makerdao protocol, Instadapp provides a user-friendly means of managing CDPs and is integrated with fellow defi products Uniswap and Kyber.

The Ethereum ecosystem has dominated P2P crypto lending, aided by its smart contract architecture that enables a diverse array of lending products to be created and automatically enforced. Without the once booming ICO industry to support it, Ethereum’s proponents have been desperately searching for the next use case, which may also account for why the defi narrative is being pushed so aggressively. Nevertheless, the ready availability of stable digital currency, with the suite of lending applications this unlocks, is sure to spark further innovation while granting startups and individuals greater access to capital. Last week, the number of daily ERC20 stablecoin transactions surpassed that of ETH, attesting to the growth of P2P lending on the network.

BCH and BTC Lending Record Robust Growth

Bitcoin has not been left behind in the race to scale P2P lending solutions. Borrowers can obtain fiat cash in exchange for their BCH and BTC through lending platforms such as Nexo and Coinloan. With the latter platform, lenders can supply fiat or stablecoins and earn interest on their stake. Borrowers, meanwhile, can collateralize their bitcoin (or their XMR, LTC, CLT, or ONT) and obtain fiat currency or stablecoins. Coinloan matches lenders and borrowers and handles custody. Provided the borrower pays the interest they are due on time, their crypto collateral will not be touched.

Nexo operates a similar model, giving borrowers access to more than 45 fiat currencies. Over $100 million of crypto assets are held by Nexo, with Bitgo providing custody and assets fully insured. Coins such as BTC, XRP, and BNB can be used for collateral in exchange for a fiat loan which starts at 8% APR per year. One of the reasons why P2P lending platforms such as Nexo are so popular for crypto businesses is that there are no credit checks. Proving creditworthiness, particularly if you’re a new business, can be extremely difficult, and is one of the biggest impediments to startups getting off the ground. Blockchain businesses with crypto assets on hand have a means to bootstrap without needing to offload their precious cryptocurrency.

It’s a strategy that’s not without its risks, as a significant drawdown in crypto prices could force the liquidation of collateralized assets. Nevertheless, compared to the alternatives – negotiating with crypto-averse banks and extortionate lending platforms – P2P cryptocurrency lending solutions are a welcome alternative. They capture the spirit and utility for which bitcoin was designed and complement P2P exchanges such as local.bitcoin.com, resulting in a trustless and permissionless financial system that is open to all.

What in your view are the main advantages and disadvantages of P2P crypto lending? Let us know in the comments section below.

Germany, the locomotive of Europe’s huge economy, is entering a difficult period, various indicators suggest. And when the Federal Republic sneezes, the Old Continent usually catches a cold. This time, Germany may infect the rest of the world as well. Regulators in the country are busy drafting prohibitions, and now also seem to target cryptocurrencies. A German economic and financial crisis would be a seismic event of global proportions, affecting all markets. The main question now seems to be when it will happen, not if.

Biggest Drop In a Decade – German Industry Is Hurting

The industrial powerhouse of the Eurozone and the greater European Union is now seeing a significant decline in production – by 2.7% year-on-year in January and 1.9% in April compared to the previous month. Then in May, factory orders declined 2.2% from a month ago and registered an 8.6% annual drop, the biggest in a decade. In the first half of 2019, even beer sales were down 2.7%, according to Destatis, the Federal Statistical Office.

International trade wars and geopolitical uncertainty in the region and beyond are negatively affecting the German economy, which relies heavily on exports. They form almost half of the country’s annual economic output. Germany is Europe’s leading exporter of goods and it ranks third among the largest exporters in the world, after China and the United States.

Several factors have been hurting German exports which registered an annual decrease of 0.5% in April. Demand from China, which is a major market for German products, has been weakening due to slowing growth. U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum are also a major concern and the Trump administration is now considering whether to impose tariffs on European cars.

Addressing the Bundestag last month, Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of a new global financial crisis as a potential result from a trade war with the U.S. She stressed that tariffs on cars would be much more serious than those on steel. The steepest slide in orders has been in the auto industry. Then there’s the upcoming Brexit divorce Germany has to deal with as well.

Short Working Weeks Are Back

Against this backdrop, a growing number of German companies are reintroducing short-time work schemes, the kind that were implemented during the last global financial crisis to mitigate its impact on industrial enterprises and their workforce. According to a survey conducted by the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research, 8.5% of the companies in Germany’s manufacturing sector expect to introduce short-time work programs over the next three months.

This is the highest percentage since 2013, Deutsche Welle reported, as last year only 2.6% of industrial entities were considering shorter working weeks for their employees. Germany still has one of the lowest unemployment rates among developed nations. In 2018, only 3.4% of its citizens between 15 and 74 years old had no job. Unemployment in the Euro area remains much higher at 7.9% at the end of December. Shorter working hours are definitely helping keep the indicator as low as possible.

The negative trends forced the nation’s central bank to revise its economic forecast, taking into account the outlook for the global commerce hit hard by the trade disputes between major players on the world scene. Bundesbank now thinks the German economy will grow only around 0.6% this year. The number represents a significant retreat from its previous prediction of 1.6% which was announced in December.

Financial Meltdown Brewing in Europe

The EU as a whole and the Eurozone in particular remain very diverse clubs of nations in terms of economic status. Some countries, particularly from the Southern flank, continue to register double-digit unemployment rates, 18% in Greece for example. While Spain’s economy is doing relatively well, Italy is practically in recession. Rome never managed to overcome its slow growth and a decade after the 2008 crash the Italian economy remains smaller than before the global financial crisis.

In May, a senior adviser to the German government shared with the BBC his fears that another European financial crisis could be brewing. Dr. Lars Feld, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts, singled out Italy. He noted that the country, which has the third largest economy in the single currency area, is struggling to stay out of recession as it has to deal with both a banking crisis that can affect the euro and a very high government debt, which reached a record high 132.2% of GDP in 2018.

A recession in Italy, which is also the world’s eighth largest economy by nominal GDP, sounds bad enough, but a slowdown in Germany would be even more damaging. A full-blown recession in the Federal Republic could definitely trigger a global crisis. Last year, Dr. Feld was one of the first to warn that the largest European economy is slowing down. It actually shrank in the second quarter of this year. But while the government adviser is worried, the executive power in Berlin seems to be in a state of denial.

‘We Are Not in Crisis’ Finance Minister Insists

In a recent interview with Bloomberg, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz downplayed warnings about the negative outlook for the German economy and revealed that the federal government has no plans to stimulate economic growth. He believes that resolving man-made crises, such as the ongoing trade wars and Brexit, would increase growth rates in 2020, the year many now point to as the start of the next big crash. Insisting that more government spending now would rather lead to inflation than growth, Scholz stated:

We are not in a situation that makes it necessary or wise to act as if we were in a crisis, we are not.

Germany’s finance minister made these comments right after the European Central Bank indicated its intentions to increase its monetary support for the Eurozone economy in the coming months. Speaking to media in Frankfurt, ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that manufacturing in Germany and elsewhere in Europe may need increased government spending.

In June, the European Central Bank indicated its ultra-low interest rates are likely to remain in place until at least mid-2020, six months longer than the previously stated goal. ECB’s management is also preparing for further cuts that will take interest rates into negative territory. In the Eurozone, they have been going down for seven years and have been at 0% since 2016. More quantitative easing is also on the horizon, which means printing more money.

Such policies would have a hard time winning support from the German coalition government lead by Angela Merkel. Olaf Scholz, who is also her deputy, believes the tax cuts that have been made so far and the infrastructure spending are working fine and additional stimulus would not be a wise idea. In essence, Frankfurt wants to bolster economic growth with QE and negative interest rates, while Berlin sees only rising prices as a result of these measures.

Too Big to Fail

If there’s one thing Germany fears, it’s inflation. Being a leading exporter of high value added, quality products, inflation of the euro would decrease its revenues. And that’s one of the biggest contradictions of the Eurozone as countries like Italy actually need higher inflation so that their exports remain at least price competitive in relation to the German exports.

Berlin has gotten itself, and the rest of Europe, into an almost hopeless situation. The Eurozone is tuned in a way that benefits its largest economy. That, however, leads to the concentration of money in Germany whose banks have been lending it back to the weaker partners in the Eurozone and the EU to sustain them and their markets. Sooner or later, the poor borrowers won’t be able to take any more debt. It’s already happened with Greece, for example.

Germany has become a lender, supplier and consumer that’s too big to fail. A German crisis would surely drag the rest of the Eurozone and hurt the global economy. So now Europe is basically financing Germany through low and subzero interest rates. Things are nearing a point where normal economic logic isn’t part of the equation anymore. Investors are literary paying more and more to lend money to Germany, as Welt business editor Holger Zschaepitz remarked in a tweet this week. Berlin recently sold €2.345 billion of 10-year debt at a record low yield of -0.41%.

Whatever the German finance minister says and does, there’s a well-grounded feeling that the next big crisis is looming. The troubles of Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest financial institution and top banking services provider, are proof that something is wrong with the traditional financial system. The fact that central banks bought a record $15.7 billion of gold in the first half of the year and German investors piled into gold-backed exchange traded funds, as Financial Times reported, is a strong indication of efforts to diversify away from fiat currencies.

“In Europe we have a dysfunctional monetary union,” German finance strategy consultant Marc Friedrich told news.Bitcoin.com. “The South suffers with the euro and will never get better within the euro,” the economist emphasized. Friedrich thinks the recession is already coming and believes that in its aftermath a new monetary system will be born, a digital one, in which societies will need decentralized currencies.

Unfortunately, German regulators are making it harder for crypto businesses to operate freely in the Bundesrepublik. Companies from the industry, such as exchanges, payment providers and custodians, will have to apply for a special license from Bafin, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. They have to do so by the end of the year with the introduction of new AML rules based on EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive which must be transposed into German law by January 2020.

According to information shared on crypto forums, the new regulations are already affecting platforms dealing with cryptocurrencies. For example, Germany is no longer on the list of countries supported by Bitpay, a leading payment processor that allows many businesses outside the industry to accept coins through conversion to fiat.

Of course, direct crypto payments remain a viable alternative. You can process bitcoin cash payments using the Bitcoin Cash Register app for iOS and Android. The simple Point of Sale software developed by Bitcoin.com allows merchants to accept BCH at any retail location. Payments are easy, safe and no account or registration is needed to install and use it.

And we end this week, not with a song this time, but some lighthearted, harmless fun.",,https://quillandpad.com/2019/08/03/how-the-watch-industry-is-testing-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-plus-five-brands-that-have-already-waded-in/,"Blockchain technology is just a digital trail of a transaction, a watch part – or anything really – that anyone can download and see and add to, but not delete any part of. Yet the two parties involved remain anonymous.

No one can rewrite the transaction history, nor will it ever disappear. Right away the benefit of anonymous transactions and tracking is apparent, if not yet mainstream in the timekeeping industry.

Cryptocurrency uses blockchain technology in its transactions. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, and Facebook’s Libra are all cryptocurrencies. There are more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies in the market, but Bitcoin is by far the most used. However, Facebook with its worldwide reach and 2.4 billion customers could easily eclipse Bitcoin if it wished.

Each cryptocurrency works as a medium of exchange using blockchain cryptography to execute financial transactions. While the transactions are public, the counterparties remain anonymous as do the nature of their commerce.

That’s it. Nothing more complicated than that.

How does the watch industry use blockchain?

For starters, the watch industry suffers hugely from counterfeiters.

By attaching a unique Quick Response Code (QR for short) to a watch, then using blockchain to track its entire history from the beginning of the manufacturing process onward throughout its entire life, every step is permanently recorded. Steps can be added – such as services – but never deleted. This way, there’s no question whatsoever as to authenticity.

Richemont seems to be on the bleeding edge of employing blockchain. Among its many brands, it has chosen Vacheron Constantin – the world’s oldest continually operating watch manufacture – to test blockchain technology in tracking watches, beginning with its Les Collectionneurs line of vintage, pre-owned watches. If successful, the one-of-a-kind blockchain certification (which cannot be lost, stolen, or forged) could replace paper authentication.

Further, this indelible digital certificate of authenticity follows the watch throughout its life. The unique QR code and the particular movement and watch to which it is assigned are inseparable. This guarantees authentic data about the watch, its value, and authenticity.

Using blockchain technology, the pre-owned and vintage markets instantly have a proven way to authenticate any watch with a unique QR code. This certainly won’t collapse the watch forgery industry – which seems to have its own place, however distasteful – but at least it prevents surreptitious bleed-over into the legitimate market.

Because scanning the QR code is so quick and easy (load any scan app onto your mobile phone, point the camera at the QRC, and it goes to the intended site), distinguishing an authentic watch from a fake could stabilize values in the secondary market, leaving only the watch’s condition, rarity, and perhaps its provenance as the differentiating factors to affect price.

Then there’s the grey market. The incorruptible blockchain can track the shipping progress of every new watch, from the brand in question to individual retailers and finally to the end consumer. It’ll flag any deviation to grey market operators.

Unique QR codes linked to a blockchain database could become the watch industry’s authentication standard in the next few years.

Who uses cryptocurrency and for what?

It has been said that Bitcoin is the millennial’s gold; that it’s a generational marriage between innovation and personal choice. That’s a huge stretch considering the nature of cryptocurrency transactions.

The most frequent use of cryptocurrency is for speculation – usually in Bitcoin. That isn’t buying or selling a commodity. Nor is it investing. Far from it.

Bitcoin is among the most volatile of any traded [dare I say?] currencies. Buying it in the hopes of cashing in on its appreciation is about as smart as grabbing a falling knife.

The second most frequent use of cryptocurrency is on the dark web – usually for illegal drug transactions. “Bitcoin is the most common form of payment for drug sales on dark net marketplaces and is emerging as the conveyance of choice for transferring illicit drug proceeds internationally,” the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency wrote in its 2017 National Drug Threat Assessment.

The next most popular uses of cryptocurrencies – almost always in Bitcoin – are illegal money laundering, ransomware, and evading international sanctions. Indeed, North Korea’s currency of choice seems to be Bitcoin. Iran and Russia are fast following suit into cryptocurrency for the purpose of evading U.S. sanctions.

Add to these uses crypto theft and hacking the crypto infrastructure for fun and profit, and we’ve covered the lion’s share of cryptocurrency usage. The tiniest use category is legitimate transactions – such as buying a watch.

Watches that uses Bitcoin: four brands lead the way

At least four prominent watch brands have hopped on the Bitcoin bandwagon, though: Franck Muller, Chronoswiss, A. Favre & Fils, and Hublot. Of these, Franck Muller seems to have the most robust cryptocurrency model.

Franck Muller Vanguard Encrypto

This high horology brand is famous for its unique designs beginning with its typical Cintrée Curvex case as well as fans among various Hollywood glitterati and top athletes. Franck Muller’s entry into the cryptocurrency space is its Vanguard Encrypto watch.

The Vanguard Encrypto watch interacts with the owner’s Bitcoin wallet. Here’s how it works.

Each watch has its own unique QR code etched on the watch dial. That’s the public address for the owner’s personal Bitcoin wallet. Anyone can scan the QR code on the watch face and see the value of the Bitcoin wallet. The owner’s identity remains completely anonymous.

The second component in the Muller Encrypto package is a sealed USB device containing a private key code. The owner (or anyone with a clear view to scan the watch dial) can add Bitcoins to the owner’s wallet or check the balance.

However, removing Bitcoins from the wallet requires use of the USB device. For example, say Iran’s Hassan Rouhani wants to buy some nuclear centrifuges, U.S. sanctions notwithstanding. Rouhani just scans his Vanguard Encrypto watch to open the Islamic State’s Bitcoin wallet, then inserts his USB device into his laptop to verify access.

The required millions of Bitcoins instantly transfer to Vladimir Putin’s Bitcoin wallet. Transaction closed, and the centrifuges leave Novorossiysk for Bandar Abbas. Since the parties to this purchase are totally anonymous, the public sees only the flow of Bitcoins, not who paid or received them or for what purpose – a completely dark transaction.

And it’s far easier logistically than spending some of the $400 million in cash Barack Obama shipped to Rouhani in pallets aboard a cargo jet in 2016 in exchange for signing his nuclear treaty.

Franck Muller’s regional director Erol Baliyan says, “We always aim to impact the customer at an emotional level and create a bond between the customer and the timepiece. As a brand, we are a trend maker with a solid track record and are not shy when it comes to adopting innovation.”

Franck Muller says the Encrypto watch is the first crypto-wearable. The Bitcoin logo sits front and center, right below the owner’s unique laser-etched QR code.

Buyers can order the case in a variety of metals as well as customize the dial with precious metals and diamonds. The cost for the watch ranges between $10,000 and $50,000 depending on case materials and diamond setting.

Deep cold storage features

Deep cold storage is simply cryptocurrency jargon describing how owners can keep a reserve of Bitcoins offline, protected from system failures and security breaches. It’s the digital cousin to a safety deposit box in a bank.

Franck Muller’s Vanguard Encrypto facilitates keeping a cache of Bitcoins in deep cold storage by using the two-piece authentication (the watch’s QR code on its face and the USB encrypted key). By the way, the USB device allows complete access (deposit or withdrawal) to the Bitcoin wallet and should be treated as cash. Franck Muller suggests it be kept in a highly secure, access-controlled location.

Each Franck Muller Encrypto timepiece is a two-piece set with its own unique public QRC address etched on the dial and a sealed USB device containing the private wallet access key. Owners can add Bitcoins to their virtual wallets or check their balances directly by scanning the watch dial.

To spend their Bitcoins, they need the USB key and a laptop.

Investing in Bitcoin

Editorial disclaimer: Bitcoin value is extraordinarily volatile (about six times that of the S&P 500). It moves on a daily basis in large swings for no apparent reason. It is not an investment vehicle, but rather an instrument of speculation. Perhaps that’s the reason Franck Muller designed this watch to be big and flashy with optional diamonds – exactly the watch a high-rolling cryptocurrency speculator would want strapped to his or her wrist.

Franck Muller designed the Vanguard Encrypto’s QR code and cold storage system in partnership with Regal Assets, an alternative asset investment company with corporate headquarters in Waco, Texas.

I could not verify Regal Assets or its CEO, Tyler Gallagher, as being registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or the SEC. Unregistered firms are not subject to the rules, regulations, or oversight governing licensed U.S. broker/dealers and registered investment advisers.

Regal Assets touts Bitcoin as an alternative investment for IRA accounts (see editorial disclaimer above). IRAs buying Bitcoin is an exercise requiring several steps. First, you need to establish a self-directed IRA if you don’t already have one. You’ll also need to establish an IRA LLC.

The LLC will be the entity buying and selling Bitcoin for the IRA account. Honestly, I wasn’t able to figure out how to use the Encrypto watch and USB key to buy and sell Bitcoin for an IRA account. There’s probably a way, but it escaped me.

One more thing about investing in Bitcoin for your IRA: you cannot transfer any Bitcoins you now own directly into your IRA LLC. You must first sell it, transfer the dollars into your IRA LLC, then buy back the Bitcoins for benefit of your IRA account. The same procedure follows for a Roth IRA.

The Vanguard Encrypto is a limited-edition watch of just 500 units of each version available online. Franck Muller accepts credit cards, bank transfers, or payment in Bitcoin. It is available both online and at the Franck Muller boutique in the Dubai Mall.

Chronoswiss gently enters the Bitcoin market

Chronoswiss, founded in Munich in 1983 and now under Swiss ownership, hopes to up its cool index by slipping into Bitcoin’s updraft. The company will produce just 100 Flying Regulator Open Gear Blockchain watches, and it already accepts payment for watches ordered in its online webshop in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The three-dimensional regulator-style dial’s top level boasts very mechanical-looking funnel-like subdial frames for displays of hours and seconds together with obvious, skeletonized bridges bracing some visible gear wheels.

The dial’s bottom level features a galvanic black background with multi-logo print of Bitcoin along with the Bitcoin logo inside the subdial for the seconds.

This is a beautifully crafted watch. Chronoswiss’ Caliber C.299, which is based on an automatic ETA movement with hacking seconds and a modified regulator gear train, hums along inside the 16-piece stainless steel case coated with black DLC. The strap is equally high-end in hand-sewn black hornback crocodile. The price is 8,356.55 Swiss francs.

Though this Chronoswiss watch model is not interactive with Bitcoin (the logo references to Bitcoin being just for show), the guarantee certificate that comes with it uses blockchain technology.

The company has a relationship with Tech Bureau, a fintech and cryptocurrency company in Japan, the U.S., and Europe. Tech Bureau has developed Mijin, a private blockchain software, and Zaif, a Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange platform. With this strategic relationship, there may well be a future Chronoswiss watch offering that actually uses blockchain and/or Bitcoin technology.

A. Favre & Fils

A. Favre & Fils has offered Swiss watches off and on for something like three centuries, beginning with a certain Abraham Favre, who found a calling in watchmaking in 1718. A 2008 refounding of the firm was actuated by 46-year-old Laurent Favre.

The Swiss firm just announced it is developing a handcrafted mechanical timepiece with a built-in crypto cold wallet and a proprietary security solution using blockchain technology.

The new watch was scheduled for release before the end of June 2019 according to a press release, but none of the Quill & Pad team has seen it yet. The company’s press release says the watch will, “guarantee [the] ultimate in data security and privacy protection.”

The price is quoted as $102,000 – $153,000. No price quote in Bitcoin since the conversion rate moves so fast.

Unfortunately, the company hasn’t offered any further details on how the crypto wallet works. The image above was shown as a teaser without authentication of it being the final design of the new blockchain watch. We’ll have to wait and see.

Hublot

Hublot seems to be proceeding cautiously into the Bitcoin world with a first step being the 210-piece limited edition Big Bang MECA-10 P2P (peer-to-peer, the type of payment enabled by Bitcoin). Why the 210-piece limit? It’s a reference to the maximum global limit of 21 million Bitcoins.

The watch can only be purchased online and paid for using Bitcoins. It does not interact with blockchain nor offer any sort of offline deep cold storage wallet oozing Bitcoins. However, it does have the transaction number engraved on the bezel edge.

This, coupled with the purchase exclusively using Bitcoins, produces an indelible blockchain record. It serves as a digital verification of authenticity rather than a traditional and less reliable serial number appearing on a paper sales receipt and warranty card.

Hublot’s MECA-10 line carries the brand’s Big Bang “DNA.” It is big, sporting a 45 x 15.95 mm case made of microblasted black ceramic. The skeletonized HUB1201 manually wound movement has a power reserve of ten days (would be nice if that were in honor of Bitcoin’s tenth anniversary, but this astonishingly long serial power reserve is represented by the “10” in the “MECA-10” line) that is shown on the 6 o’clock subdial. The Bitcoin logo appears at the 3 o’clock position.

A true nod to Bitcoin’s anniversary comes from the only Arabic numeral hour marker on the dial: the 10.

The unique case back shows an engraved world map upon which blue dots connect throughout the various countries depicted. This is a reference to the world’s interconnectivity fostered by blockchain and using Bitcoin as the international currency of choice. The MECA-10 is water resistant to 100 meters and comes only in black microblasted ceramic with blue elements.

The rubber-and-calfskin strap boasts an embossed circuit board design as an homage to blockchain, networks, and interconnected computers.

The cost of this latest piece from Hublot – paid in Bitcoins, whose value fluctuates by the second – is approximately the equivalent of $25,000.

The How And Why Of Patents, Including The World’s Most Famous Watchmaking Patent Granted For Abraham-Louis Breguet’s Tourbillon

The Golden Age Of Rolex Movements Part IV: Patents And Predictions For The Future of Rolex Watchmaking",2019-08-03,https://observer.com/2019/08/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-cryptocurrency-economic-freedom-ten-years/,"The success of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, the largest of its kind in the U.S., has made its founder and CEO Brain Armstrong an overnight billionaire. And as soon as the 36-year-old entrepreneur realized he’d made way more money than he ever needed, he joined the Giving Pledge, the billionaire philanthropist club created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, committing to give away the majority of his wealth.

“Once a certain level of wealth is reached, there is little additional utility from spending more on yourself. One’s ambition begins to move outwards,” Armstrong said when he signed the Giving Pledge in December of 2018.

That ambition applies to his business as well. At a company event this week, Armstrong laid out a roadmap for Coinbase’s next decade. His ultimate vision sounds intimidating yet familiar for a tech entrepreneur his age: to change the world.

A central theme in Armstrong’s presentation is economic freedom, a term often used by economists and politicians to describe the degree of financial soundness of people in a society.

Armstrong noted the widely varying levels of economic freedom in different countries and the overall slow progress of global economic freedom in the past 25 years. This situation, however, may be changed by Coinbase one day.

“We can actually bend this curve,” Armstrong said, pointing to a flattened line on the screen describing the historical trend of global economic freedom. “The vision for Coinbase is creating more economic freedom for every person and business in the world over the next 10 years.”

But how will it work? Armstrong explained that cryptocurrency has a number of unique characteristics that will allow regular people to take the key steps in achieving economic freedom. For example, crypto’s barrier-free cross-border payment system would facilitate free trade and make it easier for startup founders to raise funds globally.

Crypto could even help combat inflation, a major weakness in government-backed currencies, Armstrong said. Earlier this year, a Coinbase-backed startup called Stablecoin launched a payment app in Venezuela to help local residents cope with worsening hyperinflation in the South American country.

Moving into the future, Coinbase will continue counting on its incubator program, Coinbase Ventures, to create a network of companies in the crypto ecosystem. Launched just a year ago, the venture arm has funded more than 50 startups in the blockchain and crypto space.

“Coinbase can’t do it alone, there needs to be thousands of companies out there,” Armstrong said, adding that, if all goes according to the plan, Coinbase could enable “a billion people, in five to 10 years, to access an open financial system through our products every day.”",2019-08-03 13:30:05+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/moneygram-is-now-live-with-xrp-and-ripple/,"Share this article

One of the largest providers of global money transfers is ready for cryptocurrency. MoneyGram, which ranks just behind Western Union in cross-border transfers, is now ready to use Ripple’s xRapid network, which uses the XRP currency.

“MoneyGram is now live and transacting on the Ripple xRapid platform,” announced CEO Alexander Holmes, during the second quarterly earnings call. “We started executing trades earlier this week and all signs point to this being a tremendously beneficiary [sic] relationship. We are literally settling transactions in seconds.”

A press release accompanying the report highlighted that the integration was the result of Ripple’s “pioneering equity investment” earlier this year. Noting the $30 million “equity infusion” after Ripple acquired a stake in the company, the report went on to explain that MoneyGram would have the option to sell up to $20 million of additional equity to Ripple through June 30, 2020.

The crux of the agreement could get MoneyGram users involved in cryptocurrency without even knowing it. “The commercial agreement allows MoneyGram to utilize Ripple’s xRapid blockchain product, as well as XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, to facilitate cross-border settlement,” the company said. MoneyGram hopes that Ripple’s technology will “reduce working capital needs” and “generate additional earnings and cash flow.”

MoneyGram is a significant entity in the global remittance market, servicing 200 countries and processing approximately $600 billion in remittances. By using Ripple’s xRapid technology and XRP, the cost of settlement could fall from about $30 per transaction to “fractions of a penny” while speeding up transactions from up to an hour to a few seconds.

Upon entering the partnership, MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes had expressed enthusiasm for xRapid technology, explaining its far-reaching impact. “Through Ripple’s xRapid product,” he said, ” we will have the ability to instantly settle funds from U.S. dollars to destination currencies on a 24/7 basis, which has the potential to revolutionize our operations and dramatically streamline our global liquidity management.”

Yesterday’s call revealed that XRP in particular is playing a role in MoneyGram’s innovations. However, Holmes did not reveal exact figures, such as number of transactions or payment corridors in which XRP could be used.",2019-08-03 14:17:49+00:00

Cryptocurrencies cannot be purchased with the new Apple credit card according to the American multinational technology company’s recently published customer agreement guidelines. The Apple card’s restrictions indicate that the company’s partner, Goldman Sachs, is leery toward cryptocurrencies and other “cash equivalents” like lottery tickets and casino chips.

No Crypto Purchases With the Goldman Sachs Backed Apple Card

The technology giant Apple (AAPL) recently announced the launch of a credit card, which allows people to spend credit with an annual percentage rate (APR) between 13-24%. The California-based firm revealed the card will be released at some point this month, according to the firm’s third fiscal quarter earnings call. Some of the biggest selling points for the new Apple Mastercard include: virtual use, no annual fees, and no fees for transactions and penalties. Another interesting aspect is that the card will not feature the traditional Mastercard 16-digit number or CVV code. “Thousands of Apple employees are using the Apple Card every day in a beta test and we will begin to roll out the Apple Card in August,” Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed during the earnings call on July 30. Following Cook’s statements, the Apple card’s terms of service (ToS) were published via the Goldman Sachs’ website this week.

Two of the biggest issues that stand out for people who have read the customer agreement include the restrictions against jailbreaking an iPhone and restricting “cash equivalents” like cryptocurrencies. This is first addressed in the user agreement’s first section called “Important Definitions,” which essentially defines the terms used within the agreement. “‘Cash Advance and Cash Equivalents’ means any cash advance and other cash-like transactions, including purchases of cash equivalents such as travelers checks, foreign currency, or cryptocurrency; money orders; peer to peer transfers, wire transfers or similar cash-like transactions; lottery tickets, casino gaming chips (whether physical or digital), or race track wagers or similar betting transactions,” explains the Apple card ToS.

Being against “cash equivalents” is not all that different than most traditional credit ToS agreements, and banning things like lottery purchases is standard procedure for credit cards. Some skeptics believe it’s not that Apple wants to police what you can purchase, but that the blame likely falls on Goldman Sachs. Crypto purchases using credit cards already experienced pushback from banks and regulators after it was revealed that lots of people were using charge cards to purchase bitcoin and other digital assets during the last bull run. By the end of 2017 it was revealed that Capital One, Chase, Bank of America, Lloyds Banking Group, Discover, Virgin Money, and TD Bank Canada had all banned digital currency purchases. According to Capital One, the bank sees digital assets may lead to high risks of fraud and severe losses. “Capital One continues to closely monitor developments in cryptocurrency markets and exchanges,” the bank said back in 2018. “And [Capital One] will regularly evaluate the decision as cryptocurrency markets evolve,” the bank explained.

Apple’s Long History of Cryptocurrency Restrictions

Despite Goldman Sachs involvement with Apple this time, the corporation had already had a long history with certain cryptocurrency restrictions. For instance, in February 2014, Apple had removed all the bitcoin wallets from the App Store including Blockchain.com’s Wallet, Coinbase, and Coinjar. After the wallet ban, Blockchain.com wrote a blog post which denounced Apple’s choice to remove the wallet application. “These actions by Apple once again demonstrate the anti­-competitive and capricious nature of the App Store policies that are clearly focused on preserving Apple’s monopoly on payments rather than based on any consideration of the needs and desires of their users,” Blockchain.com’s scathing critique stated. “[Blockchain wallet] had no customer complaints and a broad user base. The only thing that has changed is that bitcoin has become competitive to Apple’s own payment system. By removing the Blockchain app, the only bitcoin wallet application on the App Store, Apple has eliminated competition using their monopolistic position in the market in a heavy-handed manner.”

A few months later, after the Bitcoin community got riled up and some enthusiasts even filmed Youtube videos of themselves blowing up iPhones in protest, Apple silently let crypto wallet apps back into the App Store. However, in September of 2016, Apple started banning certain types of digital currency wallets that supported coins like dash and ethereum. The creator of the Jaxx multi-cryptocurrency wallet and CEO, Anthony Di Iorio, received word from Apple at the time that his startup was required to remove support for dash. Apple again had a change of heart later, and quietly allowed wallet developers to add a variety of digital assets. On June 8, 2018, Apple finally defined its cryptocurrency rules for the App Store and gave people better clarity on what kind of crypto apps would be allowed.

“Wallet apps may facilitate virtual currency storage, provided they are offered by developers enrolled as an organization,” explained Apple’s revised App Store rules. “Exchange apps may facilitate transactions or transmissions of cryptocurrency on an approved exchange, provided they are offered by the exchange itself.”

Apple did restrict initial coin offering applications, and mobile platforms that provided crypto mining applications using an iPhone’s chipset were strictly prohibited. Any ICO application would have to be established by: “banks, securities firms, futures commission merchants (“FCM”), or other approved financial institutions.”

Apple Can Decline Transactions for Any Reason and Jailbreaking a Smartphone Could Cause Service Disruptions

As far as the Apple card is concerned, if the company or partner bank (Goldman Sachs) finds out that an individual has attempted to purchase digital currencies, the card could be shut off indefinitely. Apple may decline transactions “for any reason” and the company will advise the digital currency sales associates why the transaction was declined at the time of rejection. In addition to the cryptocurrency purchasing restrictions, the Apple user agreement highlights that if a user decides to modify, root or “jailbreak” their mobile device, Apple will disconnect the credit card from the device as it constitutes a violation of the customer agreement.

At 15:00 UTC on August 4, bitcoin rose above $11,000 for the first time in 21-days.

BTC’s price stalled and then was retested along the $10,600 area on Aug. 4, proceeded by a breakout above $11,000, 10 hours after its most recent sell-off. BTC was last seen changing hands at $11,227 after a strong hourly candle broke above $11,050.

The move for BTC has also been accompanied by $3.9 billion in total volume traded over a 24-hour period hinting at a need for greater levels in order to sustain any further pushes to previous resistances seen at $11,400 and $11,880, but given today’s trajectory that is certainly possible.

As a result, other major names are flashing green today with Ether (ETH), TRON (TRX) and Tezos (XTZ) up between 1.7 and four percent, respectively.

Further, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined rose by more than $9 billion over a 24-hour period, marking another consecutive day in the green and spurring on the possibility for a continuation in BTC’s price.

On Aug. 4, the Cabinet of Iran ratified and released a new bill saying that the government will not recognize any domestic trading activity involving cryptos, Iranian news agency PressTV reports today.

Per the report, the new bill says that the government and the banking system will not view digital coins as legal tender, and Iran’s central bank will not guarantee their value.

The new bill follows comments from the deputy governor of Iran’s central bank, who in July announced that buying and selling cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) was illegal.

Mining allowed albeit with heavy permitting scheme

Iran had previously authorized cryptocurrency mining as an industrial activity within a specified permitting scheme. In order to mine cryptocurrency in Iran, local miners will have to get approval from Iran’s Ministry of Industry, Mine and Trade, as well as to ensure that their mining facilities are located outside a 30-kilometer perimeter of all provincial centers in the country.

The capital Tehran and the central city of Isfahan are excluded from the list as they will be practicing stricter regulatory restrictions, PressTV notes. As a part of the new rules, crypto miners will be charged for using energy based on the prices applied for the export of energy from Iran.

While mining is now legal in the country, the deputy president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration recently noted that the agency has not issued licenses for importing digital currency mining equipment into the country.

On July 31, Iranian provincial police arrested an individual for smuggling crypto mining equipment worth around $230,000.

The new crypto bill was introduced in Iran in the light of increased popularity of cryptocurrency mining as a method of avoiding international sanctions.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/litecoin-halving-all-you-need-to-know,"With just one day to go until Litecoin’s (LTC) next halving event, Cointelegraph sets out all you need to know about the cryptocurrency’s reduction in block rewards. In spite of their reputation for creating price hikes, the lead up to the halving has witnessed a 25 percent decline in valuation over the last month.

What is halving?

Halving is a process that occurs when the mining reward for a cryptocurrency is reduced by 50%. Miners receive crypto rewards for solving problems that create each new block on a given blockchain. The rewards differ for each cryptocurrency. With Litecoin, miners are currently awarded 25 coins per block. After Aug. 5, miners will only receive 12.5 Litecoins per block.

Litecoin rewards halve every 840,000 blocks, a process that occurs every four years. The block speed for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 minutes, with around 576 blocks generated per day. One of the key factors to take into account is that, according to the coding behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin, only a certain amount will ever be mined. This distinct characteristic sets it apart from fiat currencies, which can theoretically be printed infinitely.

Although it’s difficult to say when the final Litecoins will be mined, the Litecoin Foundation estimates that it will be around 2142, when the maximum of 84 million Litecoins will be reached. As of press time, there are 62,983,450 Litecoins in circulation, representing 74.93% of all Litecoins that will ever be mined. This leaves roughly 21 million coins left to be mined up until 2142. Comparatively, it’s estimated that the final few Bitcoins (BTC) will be mined around 2140.

Halvings are closely followed by investors, as the consequent reduction in mining rewards affects the profitability. Accordingly, this has a knock-on effect on the price. For investors, this can be a mixed bag. According to the theory of supply and demand, halvings should drive up the price of the cryptocurrency. As they receive fewer coins per block solved, miners stop producing them until the work once again becomes profitable. As fewer coins enter circulation, the price consequently goes up, as demand — in theory — will overtake the supply. Although this sounds like a sure-fire win for investors, halvings can bring about even greater instability to an already volatile market.

Previous halvings have stoked investor interest, and the upcoming Litecoin event is no exception. According to Google Trends, searches for “Litecoin halving” peaked between June 9 and June 15, although data shows that this trend is once again increasing.

Searches for “Bitcoin halving” on Google are typically more numerous than entries for Litecoin, although this trend has reversed as of July 30.

What could happen?

In the time leading up to the halving, miners ramp up operations to maximize their returns until the whole process becomes unprofitable. Miners need to invest in powerful, specialized equipment to take on the computing challenges required for creating blocks. As the difficulty of mining blocks rises, so do electricity costs. Mining is no longer a game for individual hobbyists, with even the biggest mining farms struggling to remain profitable during the so-called crypto winter of 2018. Mining is now a big business, and businesses need to make a profit. So, when profitability falls, activities tend to cease.

The fact that miners will feel the heat after the halving is no secret, with Litecoin creator Charlie Lee predicting that many will shut up shop after Aug 5. Lee told Australian crypto news site Mickey that halving the block rewards by 50% always has an impact on the Litecoin mining ecosystem:

“When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it’s three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine.”

Despite the commonly accepted theory that a decrease in supply results in a corresponding increase in demand, Lee suggested that market sentiment also plays a role in ramping up the price:

“In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that’s kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they’re buying in, the price does actually go up.”

After Litecoin’s 2015 halving, the coin peaked in July of that year before losing nearly 50% of its value by the time of the reward reduction, culminating in a decrease of 75% in the aftermath, Mickey reports. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, told Cointelegraph via email that reducing block rewards for miners is an effective filtering process and agreed that the effect on the price is usually positive:

“Reducing the incentive for miners is good for LTC because only serious people will remain in the space. As for the price action, it is difficult and it depends a lot on the sentiment but usually this kind of action is positive for the price.”

If the price bombs following the halving, the network hash rate will tail off as mining begins to shut down, leaving only the largest mining farms operational. Once the hash rate drops below a certain point, the mining difficulty will adjust itself and smaller miners may be able to begin mining once again.

Supply and demand: Experts weigh in

Although halving events are widely considered to result in a price hike for the given cryptocurrency, market experts do not foresee any dramatic changes in valuation. Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, told Cointelegraph that halving events are usually priced in before they actually happen:

“It seems to be the case here as well. Litecoin has outperformed the rest of the market during this year's rally and some say that it was a root cause of the upward momentum in the first half of this year. It's difficult to say how or even if the price will react to the event in the short term. In the long term, reduced supply supports higher prices all else being equal.”

Renowned crypto trader and technical analyst Crypto Rand also agreed in email conversations with Cointelegraph that the halving event has already been priced in:

“I don't think the halving event will have much impact on Litecoin price, it's already priced in since one month I would say. LTC is looking pretty solid here. It just broke up the local downtrend channel after bouncing on the key $88 range support. If the downtrend of volume finally comes to an end I'm expecting a rise on the price back to $105-$110. Right now looks like a solid option among the rest of big caps.”

For Aslam, those trying to jump on the halving gravy train are already too late:

“The most important factor to remember is that these kind of planned events are already fully priced in and traders have already positioned themselves for this. Running up to the event, it is not usually wise to participate in that move because you are already too late for the party. Therefore, smart money always buy the rumour and sell the news.”

Greenspan predicts that there won’t be many surprises in mining activity, due in part to Litecoin’s scrypt algorithm:

“Litecoin's scrypt algorithm is pretty unique so the hardware used to mine it is not easily adaptable to mining other tokens. Therefore it doesn't have quite the same of competition over hashrate that some of the other cons have. My feeling is that LTC miners have had ample time to prepare for the halving so we shouldn't see any major changes.”

When asked about what investors holding LTC should be doing, Greenspan had advice:

“Holding. But more importantly spending. Litecoin's value proposition specifically involves being a more durable token for making payments. The more people use it for this purpose, the stronger the network gets.”

Some members of the crypto community are commenting that the Litecoin halving can be viewed as a test run for the upcoming midyear 2020 BTC halving and that we can consequently expect similar results. For Greenspan, the comparison is sound, although he warned that results will not be identical:

“The market has matured a lot since the last Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings. Though we couldn't possibly expect a mirror reaction, the LTC halving should give us some indication of what to expect when BTC does the same next year.”

Crypto Rand is not so sure, however, stating that investor understanding and even awareness of Litecoin juxtaposed to Bitcoin is incomparable:

“I don't think LTC halving can work as test for Bitcoin, I would say 95% of the traders/investors are not aware of the halving on LTC or they don't know what means. The coverage for BTC it's and will be a fully mainstream event, everyone will be aware of it.”

Strix Leviathan says halving profits are a myth

A blog post published on July 21 by institutional-grade algorithmic investment management platform Strix Leviathan reported that cryptocurrencies do not outperform the market in the months leading up to and following block reward reductions.

The report found that the supply and demand theory, while “certainly feasible as a logical theory,” does not result in a rapid increase in price. Per the report, Strix Leviathan analysts found that LTC outperformed the market twice prior to a reduction in block rewards, yet fell to the bottom 25% of the market in the ensuing six-month period. The report also postulates that the performance of a crypto asset both in and out of halving periods are more or less the same:

“What we find is that the return distribution of an asset’s halving periods versus the return distribution outside of its halving periods reveals that they are statistically the same at a 99% confidence level. In other words, we did not find evidence that a halving event results in abnormal pricing action and we are dealing with a circumstantial illusion. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincides more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell side pressure.”

Merged mining could mitigate block reward reductions

A report published by Binance Research, an arm of major crypto exchange Binance, found that the impact of halvings for both BTC and LTC miners could be mitigated by merged mining. Binance researchers analyzed Charlie Lee’s prediction that many miners would have to halt operations and looked into how merged mining could help keep miners on-board even after rewards have been reduced.

Merged mining uses the work done on a parent blockchain and spreads it across other smaller “child blockchains” by using auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW). The three most prominent examples of merged mining are the Litecoin-merged Namecoin (NMC), Bitcoin-merged Dogecoin (DOGE) and Myriadcoin (XMY), a cryptocurrency merged with both BTC and LTC.

The report theorized that merged mining could help mitigate the impact of reward reductions by future block rewards scheduled for both Litecoin and Bitcoin. Binance researchers also reported that smaller chains could incorporate AuxPoW in future to support greater network security and reduce the need for an independent mining operation. The report did, however, find some potential shortcomings. Researchers said that miners may not turn to merged mining due to the risk of operational costs when supporting child blockchains and potential declines in the market price.

The report cites Dogecoin as the most successful examples of merged mining, which adopted the model in August 2014. After the switch, the coin’s mining hash rate skyrocketed 1,500%. The report also found that, as of July 2019, 90% of Dogecoin’s total hash rate is sourced from Litecoin mining pools.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-social-media-is-breaking-free-how-10-blockchain-platforms-pay-you-to-post/,"Crypto Social Media is Breaking Free: How 10+ Blockchain Platforms Pay You to Post

Social media has become so embedded in most people’s everyday lives that it’s hard to imagine life — or even a span of a few hours — without it. While the social media revolution is huge, there’s another revolution within that revolution, driven by users into cryptocurrency, privacy, and immutability: incentivized, blockchain-based social media.

Steemit as Pioneer

Coming on scene as a pioneer in July 2016, Ned Scott and blockchain developer Dan Larimer’s Steemit boasted to be a first of its kind blockchain-based social media platform, allowing users to earn rewards via Steem for posting, curating, and commenting. Many users compared the site’s style to a kind of “crypto Reddit.”

Larimer, the creator of the Bitshares DEX, DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake Algorithm), and the current CTO of Block.one (EOS developer), built the site with co-founder Scott on the Steem blockchain, a Graphene-based, DPoS chain. While the site enjoyed initial, highly sensational success — with one well-known and controversial libertarian podcaster raking in $15,000 for a short “introduce yourself” post — user interest has since flagged significantly. A series of seismic management and corporate structuring shifts (including Larimer leaving the project in 2017), coupled with the crypto winter of last year, saw many loyal users searching out greener pastures.

One thing that Steemit did help establish, however, was the potential of blockchain technology to provide relative censorship resistance and successfully reward users for engagement. Neither the platform nor other users could deplatform anyone by reporting or flagging a post (a huge problem currently for many giants in the field like Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube). And when the first payouts came in the summer of 2016, a massive wave of excitement ensued. However, troubles with spambots and abuse of voting power would prove to be significant challenges down the road.

Steemit ‘Spin-Offs’

Seeking to improve on the shortcomings of the Steemit project, newly-launched (April 2019) Narrative.org has become a home to crypto bloggers interested in a less “wild west” and more centralized approach. Narrative is supposedly more resistant to the abuses which would come to plague Steemit. Multiple account creation is difficult due to KYC policy, and communities are organized around niches (tags) owned by users who can reap monetary benefits for ownership, and elect moderators (a feature not yet implemented on the beta version site) to keep spam from overwhelming the network. A central tribunal exercises executive decision-making power and moderates mostly democratic community activity.

Another notable “spin-off” of Steemit (in this case, admittedly, directly inspired via a pizza purchased with Steem rewards) is Japan’s first blockchain-based social media site, ALIS. Similar to Narrative, ALIS focuses on niche interest groups (like crypto enthusiasts and Japanese manga readers). Though current financial regulations present hurdles for the group, CEO Masahiro Yasu and company maintain their vision of helping users “find trustworthy articles and people quickly” in lieu of depending only on spammy Google search results and unreliable mainstream media. Quality content and curation are rewarded with the ALIS token.

BCH Joins the Party

Emerging on April 15, 2018, on-chain social media site memo.cash was launched on the BCH network. With features like native tipping and SLP token creation, Memo is a unique and multi-faceted way to interact with the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. The platform was notably mentioned in July by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, when he suggested that the Bitcoin Cash network might provide a temporary scalable data layer for Ethereum:

The BCH community seems to be friendly to people using their chain for whatever they want as long as they pay the tx fees (eg. https://memo.cash)

Though not as visually ornate as some blockchain-based platforms, users are drawn to the functionality and innovative aspects of the platform. The ability to authentically timestamp important information and make it virtually immutable, for example, is an important feature to many. This particular application has been suggested to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as a means by which to allow verifiable editing of Tweets.

Honest.cash

Another platform built using the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is Honest, which was launched in November, 2018. In keeping with the theme of free speech, the site affirms that:

The internet should reward quality thinking and be a place for an uncensored discussion.

Direct voting via a user wallet allows bloggers to receive BCH for their posts when other users upvote, or, like Steemit and Narrative, when successful curation occurs. While the site is still growing and completing its V2 migration, community members and the honest.cash core team and creator, Adrian Barwicki, are active in development and support via the Honest Cash Telegram chat.

It’s Anybody’s Game, But the Game Is Here to Stay

The aforementioned Larimer of Steemit fame, along with Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer, has now jumped into the social game once again with his new platform Voice, whose launch was announced June 1. During a recent Telegram Q&A, however, when potential users voiced privacy concerns about strict KYC policies of the platform, Larimer didn’t seem overly receptive:

It should prove interesting to see how the new site develops and fares against the others with drastically different philosophies and mission statements.

However different these platforms may be, it’s an exciting time for social media enthusiasts, crypto lovers, bloggers, developers, journalists and entrepreneurs alike, with the proliferation of this new generation of social media providing unique opportunities in cryptocurrency and security for users.

The lack of regulation in the crypto markets can be fertile ground for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, etc. Therefore, it is not surprising why the FATF guidelines are calling for the end of anonymity in the crypto market.

In fact, after the G-20’s determination to comply with the FATF standards, we are soon going to see their implementation around the world, and crypto users will be required to put aside their privacy — and for some, even their ideology — in order to use services under the control of the regulator.

White vs. black crypto markets

Pretty soon, what we are going to get is two separate groups of crypto addresses: clean crypto and black-market crypto. To get into the clean group, you must declare your crypto addresses, account numbers, location information, beneficiary’s name, etc. If you choose not to disclose this information, you will be automatically assigned to the black-market group.

The standards require crypto exchanges to perform extensive Know Your Client (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Each address will be identified and linked to a specific person, and there won't be any anonymous addresses coming in and out of the exchanges. This might be the end of the crypto world as we know it.

While many users will mourn the loss of their privacy, the bright side of these standards is the ability to integrate the crypto market into traditional financial markets, which can lead to a significant increase in usage and the ability to cash out crypto to fiat within the banking system.

However, because of the anarchist nature of some hodlers, there will be some who choose to retain their privacy and to be a part of the black-market group. As Jeff Horowitz, chief compliance officer at Coinbase, said:

“I get why the FATF wants to do this. But applying bank regulations to this industry could drive more people to conduct person-to-person transactions, which would result in less transparency for law enforcement.”

Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider which side to belong to — because once you go black, you can never go back. If you choose to have your addresses in the black market, it will be tough to ""come clean"" and use them without the risk of facing criminal charges.

And what about taxes?

All eyes are facing the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) now, which, after pressure by U.S. Congress to provide clarity on reporting crypto taxes, is going to publish a clarification to tax reporting soon, as stated in the response letter to Congress from May 16. This clarification will determine the executable methods for crypto tax calculation, such as determine whether taxpayers need to use a specific identification method to report or if there are other acceptable methods.

While the specific identification method identifies the exact Bitcoin (BTC) that the user sold, and calculates his/her tax liability on the sale of the actual Bitcoin based on the blockchain evidence, the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method is not taking under consideration real-time user activity. Basically, to calculate in the FIFO method, one has to make a list of all purchases and another list of all sales. Then, to do the matching: Take the first one in the purchase list and calculate the tax results as if he/she sold it at the price and on the date from the first sale in the sales list. This results in an over taxation, especially if you bought your first Bitcoin in the early years.

In order to calculate using the specific identification method, one has to identify — using evidence from the blockchain — the purchase dates and sales date of all Bitcoin that came in and out of his/her wallet for the same tax year. Then, he/she must match the purchase and sale dates and prices of the same Bitcoin using blockchain data, and finally calculate the tax liability.

The specific identification method, just like the new FATF regulation, will require the crypto taxpayer to disclose all his/her crypto addresses. Will the IRS enforce it? Stay tuned, and we will soon find out.

Anonymity claimed to be one of the fundamental essences of crypto, but will this regulation destroy cryptocurrency? Probably not. Meanwhile, the European Union’s regulatory framework sets a goal “to unveil the anonymity,” calling it “the biggest problem for combating money laundering and countering terrorist financing.” Regulation is an inevitable step in the process of market maturation, and is a major and significant step toward a much broader adoption.

Will crypto exchanges successfully adapt to the new regulation or is it a technical challenge that they are unable to implement? Will the IRS also ask for a declaration of crypto addresses? Let us know what you think in the comment section below.

Youtube Censorship Is a Boon to Crypto-Powered Video Platforms

There’s an information war raging out there on the web with everything at stake. On social media, news sites and video platforms, an almighty fight for freedom of expression is being waged. If the tech companies and media titans prevail, subjective truth will be censored, dissenters deplatformed, and human history retold by the victors. Meanwhile, the “bad guys” – normal folk who dared to voice controversial opinions or share edgy memes – will be written out of the history books altogether.

so my life has just crumbled right infront of my eyes. i cant even explain how much this hurts. @TeamYouTube please can you take another look at this. my channel ""Fainted"" has been terminated. please i voice act funny posts pic.twitter.com/V0tKdYjOR0 — fainted (@faintedsad) August 3, 2019

When Alex Jones was deplatformed by Youtube, Twitter, Google Play, and Apple in the same weekend, with Facebook shortly following, critics warned this was only the thin end of the wedge. If it could happen to the nutty but harmless Jones, they prophesied, it could happen to anyone. It turns out they were right. One year out from the multilateral ousting of the Infowars.com founder, and the information war raging across the web has started to claim collateral damage. But just as life flourishes in the unlikeliest of places, be it the darkest ocean trenches or the highest mountain peaks, the free speech blitzkrieg has spawned resistance from a string of pro-crypto and anti-censorship companies including Gab, Verasity, and Bitchute.

Censorship is a slippery slope, and once tech companies begin pandering to the demands of the (typically left-leaning) banhammer brigade, pretty soon everyone’s a target. There was once a time when social media platforms such as Twitter adhered to the free speech provisions enshrined in the U.S. constitution, which meant that anything was fair game, save doxxing or threats of physical violence. It shows how far the needle has shifted in the last five years that free speech alternative Gab is now viewed as radical for adhering to that same policy. Meanwhile, Facebook has employed 15,000 moderators who consult “a maze of PowerPoint slides spelling out what’s forbidden,” making the dominant social network a “powerful arbiter of global speech.”

Youtube Censorship Is Fueling Demand for Crypto-Friendly Alternatives

While Silicon Valley is going for broke on going woke, inside the cryptosphere (an amorphous conglomerate of blockchain, crypto and web3 companies with no official industry body, geography or hierarchy) an antidote is being brewed. Cryptocurrency began life as a means of P2P exchange, but increasingly adversarial conditions have forced it to evolve into a system for the digitally disenfranchised. Gab founder Andrew Torba is right when he refers to bitcoin as “free speech money.”

Gab has stayed loyal to BTC through its development of the Dissenter browser and its browser plugin of the same name, that enables free comment on media websites that hate the very notion of uncensored speech. Meanwhile, Brave – the software Gab forked to create its free speech web browser – is also going strong, having just surpassed 40 million downloads. The attention-based ad model that Brave pioneered has since been developed by other crypto companies, providing additional incentives for fans to ditch the censorship-happy tech giants and switch to less partisan alternatives.

Twitter is using AI to instantly detect a meme and lockout anyone who is posting it. Scary stuff. Expect this to happen throughout the entire election cycle on every platform…… but one. You can find out what the meme was only on Gab. https://t.co/mVgxMKZR8k — Gab.com (@getongab) August 3, 2019

Verasity Incentivizes Migration to Friendlier Platforms

Verasity is a crypto company that’s doing for video what Brave has done for web browsing. Its attention-based solution enables video publishers to serve rewarded content to their viewers. Verasity aims to drive adoption of crypto-friendly Youtube alternatives by providing means for creators to monetize their content across multiple platforms. What does this have to do with free speech exactly? Well, as Verasity points out, convincing viewers to switch to new platforms is no mean feat. It cites Pewdiepie, who got only 0.25% of his Youtube followers to transition to blockchain-based alternative Dlive. Providing an easy means for content creators to monetize from the intrepid souls that journey with them provides a safety net, reassuring vloggers that there are viable alternatives to the Youtube ad revenue model.

Nevertheless, as Junseth notes in “Why an Alternative to YouTube Isn’t an Easy Proposition”:

[The tech giants] can de-platform anyone or any business by kicking them off their platform and/or by refusing to sell the website’s inventory. This means that in order for there to rise up a platform that can successfully compete with YouTube and be as profitable as YouTube, they will have to first start a programmatic ad marketplace, and then monetize their videos with it … Because … Google can reduce the price of hosting … it would be nearly impossible to host content as cheaply as they do.

Verasity is not alone in its quest. A string of other competitors is rolling out the red carpet to deplatformed influencers who’ve been deemed persona non grata on the Google-owned Youtube. (That’s the same Google that’s been going to extraordinary lengths to boot Gab off its Play store, because a subset of the free speech network’s users have been known to deploy mean words.) Bitchute, while not strictly a crypto-powered video platform, uses the same P2P torrenting technology that made Bittorrent and Bitcoin so effective. And then there’s Dtube, which notes that “Because of the decentralized nature of IPFS and the STEEM blockchain,” it “is not able to censor videos, nor enforce guidelines.” Bitcoin cash proponents also have access to Cinema.cash, an anti-censorship video platform that enables content creators to get paid in BCH.

Come at the King, You Best Not Miss

For all its crimes, Youtube remains the dominant video network by a country mile. It generated $138 million in Q2 of this year alone – a remarkable increase of 220% YoY. Not everything that matters can be measured in dollars, though. When this week’s U.S. mass shootings sparked calls for further censorship (this time of the 8chan messageboard where one of the killers is believed to have shared their manifesto), Gab.com put it best to a Buzzfeed reporter:

The future of communication and the flow of information on the internet is decentralized and open source. The days of centralized data silos like Facebook, Twitter, and Google are over. The press needs to wrap their heads around this fact and fast, because the future is already here today and it cannot be stopped. Not by you, not by us, not by governments, and not by Silicon Valley.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced on July 26 that 10,000 American cryptocurrency users will receive a letter reminding them to pay taxes or amend any mistakes on past filings. At the time, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said U.S. taxpayers should take the warning letters “very seriously.” Sean Ryan, CTO of Node40, a platform that helps people calculate digital currency-based taxes, believes all three letters make it clear that exchanging one cryptocurrency for another is a taxable event.

IRS Believes the Tax Agency Is Ahead of the Curve When It Comes to Cryptocurrencies

When the IRS announced that it was sending 10,000 letters to American taxpayers who own or have once owned cryptocurrencies, the digital currency community seemed shocked. That said, many crypto proponents, lawyers, and tax accountants expected the action after the IRS told the public in May that updated tax guidelines concerning cryptocurrencies would be made available soon. Then, in mid-June, IRS agent Gary Alford, a man who helped take down the Silk Road marketplace, told the press that the IRS is ahead of the curve when it comes to understanding how digital currencies work and Americans who dodge capital gains won’t get away with it for long.

“We’re usually behind the curve — history is made and then we react to it. But in this case, we are ahead of the curve — We were there on ground zero, and we were waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to what we already knew,” Alford said speaking at on a panel on June 13 at the Columbus Citizens Foundation townhouse. “We already are aware that there were cases to be made, we just didn’t know if we were at the point where we can bring it for criminal prosecution.” Alford further told the crowd that people who own bitcoin usually tell people about it and if they tell their accountant that they never heard of bitcoin then it’s the IRS’ “burden to show this individual knew.”

Node40 Executive Believes the IRS Letters Clarify Exchanging One Crypto for Another Is Taxable

A little more than a week later after Alford’s speech, the IRS published a press release detailing how three types of letters would be delivered to 10,000 U.S. cryptocurrency owners. The CTO of the crypto-centric tax company Node40, Sean Ryan, inspected the letters and found one possible clarification nobody is talking about. Ryan spoke with news.Bitcoin.com in June and he said that clarified tax guidance from the IRS was “long overdue.” The announcement in regards to the new IRS letters followed our interview with Ryan so we spoke to the tax expert again.

“There is something that I haven’t seen covered in the news yet,” Ryan explained. “As we know, the IRS hasn’t answered several outstanding questions about the nuances of paying taxes on crypto. Yes, they’ve issued the 2014 memo but we all know it lacks clarity on certain points – chief among them is the like-kind rules. Section 1031 of the IRS code before the new tax law went into effect in 2018 could have been (and was by some) interpreted to allow for an exchange of one digital currency for another, like buying ETH for/with BTC — tax-deferred. There has been much debate about this among accountants and tax attorneys with valid arguments on both sides.”

But after reading Letter 6173, 6174 and 6174-A, Ryan thinks the IRS snuck a certain clarified rule within the three notices. “If you read the IRS Letters, all three contain a statement making clear that the exchange of one currency for another is taxable,” Ryan stressed. The Node40 executive added:

This might be the first time the IRS has publicly stated such guidance and it came across to me as a bit sneaky. The reality is it has major consequences for those traders who were operating under the belief that any gains could be deferred under the transfer of property rule. It seems unfair to me to call someone out for not properly paying tax while at the same time making clear a point of much deliberation.

Node40’s website is telling the American public that the company can help people who were served with the IRS letters concerning virtual currency transactions.

Tax Litigation Firms Warn Crypto Owners: ‘Seek an Attorney Before Disclosing Anything to the Government’

Following the tax agency’s press release, an alleged former IRS agent told the Reddit community on the subreddit r/cryptocurrency that the letters are just a “broad and very error-prone fishing expeditions.” Unfortunately, there was no way the r/cryptocurrency forum visitors could confirm whether the person was really an IRS agent or someone just playing a hoax. However, quite a few forum participants believed the post was legitimate and agreed when he said the letters were predatory. “It strikes me that this [cryptocurrency] letter writing campaign, in particular, is very unethical, as they’re blindly scaring thousands of people shitless who very well may have done absolutely nothing wrong,” the supposed former tax agent wrote.

All three letters have different meanings as Letter 6173 requests a signed response from the taxpayer in regards to alleged noncompliance. Letter 6174 simply asks the taxpayer to review their past returns and, if necessary, file an amendment. IRS Letter 6174-A notifies the taxpayer that there is potential misreporting concerning cryptocurrency transactions and the IRS may enforce criminal prosecution. It’s safe to say many Americans were alarmed by the IRS announcement and some people claim they have already received a letter and penalty quotes. Tax attorneys are already advertising online to help crypto owners if they received one of the three IRS letters. For instance, the law firm Frost & Associates LLC is now advertising to help those who are dealing with cryptocurrency tax audits and IRS Letter 6173, 6174, and 6174-A.

“Cryptocurrency compliance investigations may also turn into larger, criminal tax investigations,” Frost & Associates website details. “These situations can be a massive intrusion into your personal and professional life and your accountant could be compelled to tell the IRS everything you’ve told him or her because the “accountant-client privilege” does not extend to criminal investigations or state tax proceedings.” The litigation firm further warns:

If you believe you’re a target of a cryptocurrency tax investigation from the IRS, then you should immediately contact a tax attorney before disclosing anything to the government.

Moreover, cryptocurrency trade volumes have kicked up a notch, capturing $66 billion in swaps over the last day. Overall, speculators think the recent spike in crypto prices is due to the overwhelming economic uncertainty worldwide.

Despite Traditional Market Downturn, Crypto Markets See Steady Gains

Cryptocurrency prices have jumped northbound once again as a large number of digital assets have seen gains between 2-15% over the last 24 hours. At the time of publication, the price of bitcoin core (BTC) is hovering just below the $12K mark at $11,757 per coin. BTC is up over 8% in 24 hours and has a market valuation of around $209 billion. The cryptocurrency is up 23% over the last seven days and there’s $23 billion in global BTC trade volume on August 5. Right behind BTC is ETH which is hovering around $231 per coin and is up over 4.9% today.

Ripple (XRP) is up a hair over 2% this Monday and is trading for $0.32 per XRP. In fourth position and the biggest gainer over the last 24 hours is litecoin (LTC) as it jumped 15% after the cryptocurrency’s reward halving took place. LTC dipped a bit afterward but is still up 6% and each LTC is swapping for $99. Lastly, bitcoin cash (BCH) markets are up over 4.5% on Monday as each BCH is trading for $347. BCH is up more than 12.8% for the week and there’s $1.75 billion in global BCH trade volume today.

A Flight-to-Safety Asset

There’s been a whole lot of speculation and analysis with people trying to figure out why digital assets are pumping once again. Many people believe the rise is due to investors looking for a safe haven asset as economic turmoil strikes fear into global leaders. Charles Hayter, the founder of digital currency data website Cryptocompare, believes BTC is being used as a “flight-to-safety.” The crypto price spike started after global stock markets started tumbling when U.S. President Donald Trump told the media he would impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports.

“Bitcoin has many use cases and one of the most important is as a form of digital gold,” Hayter explained on Monday. “We have seen bitcoin jump before on macro uncertainty as it becomes a conduit and flight-to-safety asset.” Etoro’s Simon Peters thinks tensions between the U.S. and China is a plausible theory as well. “Given that Chinese investors make up a large proportion of crypto investors, there’s a strong possibility some are backing bitcoin’s chances against the yuan,” Peters told investors on August 5.

A Looming No-Deal Brexit

It’s very possible that the world could witness a no-deal Brexit in the near future. A while back when people talked about Brexit it meant that the U.K. would leave the European Union (EU) but there were certain agreements tied to the action. This year, a no-deal Brexit means the two countries will divorce and there will be no deals or agreements made when the two go separate ways. Nicholas Gregory, the CEO of Commerceblock, which builds distributed financial infrastructure, believes a no-deal Brexit could push BTC prices past the $20K all-time high.

“Bitcoin has rediscovered its mojo this year with multiple mini-surges but a no-deal Brexit could see a massive and unprecedented breakout. Not only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, but it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare,” Gregory wrote to news.Bitcoin.com on Monday. The Commerceblock founder added:

Come 2020, we expect an increasingly populist and politically unstable world to cement the safe-haven status of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally. And if central banks revert to ramping up the money printing all over again, the case for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin whose supply is capped will be further reinforced. Each time a central bank increases the money supply, it’s another nail in the coffin of fiat.

‘Rally Could Have Real Legs’ Says Galaxy Digital Executive Mike Novogratz

After cryptocurrency markets spiked this weekend and into Monday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz tweeted that the 2019 BTC rally could be real. The comment follows Novogratz’s recent interview when he told the public that the digital currency could surpass all-time highs in 2019. He attributed the rise in prices on July 25 to the recent Facebook Libra announcement and mentioned Telegram’s coin launch. On Monday, however, Novogratz blamed the global economic uncertainty and capital flight. “With the yuan over 7.0, an FX war, instability in HKG and the beginnings of capital flight, the BTC rally could have real legs,” Novogratz tweeted.

Trade and Currency Wars

Financial analyst Naeem Aslam detailed on Monday that he also thinks economic uncertainty and Donald Trump’s trade wars are helping bolster the price of BTC. “There is no doubt in mind that the Bitcoin price is going to break this year’s high,” Aslam wrote. The FX, equities, and crypto analyst said that crypto bulls can thank Trump for the spike because “it is completely driven by geopolitical tensions.”

“Donald Trump introduced new tariffs on China last week and I talked about the retaliation action by Beijing. China has unleashed its nuclear weapon on the U.S. This retaliation has come in the form of China introducing the most fearful factor for the markets, a currency war,” Aslam opined. “The Chinese Yuan crossed the level of $7 for the first time and this is only because China clearly wants to devalue its currency.” Aslam further wrote:

We all know what this means for Bitcoin; it is going to explode and continue to move higher.

Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin Markets Spike

BCH has continued to follow the upward trend as the currency has broken a decent path of upward resistance and market analyst John Isige thinks it’s possible BCH could spike to $400 per BCH in the near future. “Glancing ahead, bitcoin cash (BCH) is approaching the rising wedge pattern breakout — Trading above the pattern resistance could boost Bitcoin Cash towards $400,” Isige suggested on Monday. “Moreover, Bitcoin Cash is strongly supported initially by the 50 Simple Moving Average (SMA) 1-hour chart currently at $333.62.”

Litecoin prices jumped during Monday’s early morning trading sessions due to the cryptocurrency’s reward halving. Before LTC’s block height at 1,680,000, miners got a reward of 25 LTC but now only get 12.5 LTC per block. The halving event gave LTC prices a boost and saw the digital asset rise higher than most coins on Monday. The Litecoin network cuts its mining rewards in half every 840,000 blocks. Since the LTC halving, the digital asset is hovering around the $90-110 range.

Recent Federal Reserve Rate Cut Adds Fuel to the Crypto and Precious Metal Market Rallies

Overall, there’s no shortage of digital currency market speculators and pundits giving their two cents on the current crypto rally. A great majority of investors and enthusiasts believe cryptocurrencies are rising because of the world’s economic woes. Alongside cryptocurrencies, the price of gold has reached a six-year high and speculators believe the spike is due to the exact same reasons.

Additionally, last week, digital currency markets witnessed the first Federal Reserve interest rate cut in ten years. The Fed told the public last Wednesday that the bank would cut rates by a quarter point. Many economists believe the rate cut is troubling for the U.S. economy and even two regional Federal Reserve presidents publicly spoke out against the interest rate cut. The financial columnist from Barron’s, Ben Walsh, recently explained the Fed’s rate cut could reinforce bitcoin gains.

“The Federal Reserve has added fuel to the rally as it has shifted from raising interest rates in 2018 to keeping borrowing costs steady to its current strong hints that a reduction is on the way,” the author penned last week. “Easier monetary policy could bring more gains for bitcoin.”

Pyongyang also “continued to enhance its nuclear and missile programmes although it did not conduct a nuclear test or ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) launch,” said the report to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee by independent experts monitoring compliance over the past six months.

The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment on the report, which was submitted to the Security Council committee last week.

The experts said North Korea “used cyberspace to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks to steal funds from financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges to generate income.” They also used cyberspace to launder the stolen money, the report said.

“Democratic People’s Republic of Korea cyber actors, many operating under the direction of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, raise money for its WMD (weapons of mass destruction) programmes, with total proceeds to date estimated at up to two billion US dollars,” the report said.

North Korea is formally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Reconnaissance General Bureau is a top North Korean military intelligence agency.

The experts said they are investigating “at least 35 reported instances of DPRK actors attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining activity designed to earn foreign currency” in some 17 countries.

The U.N. experts said North Korea’s attacks against cryptocurrency exchanges allowed it “to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.”

The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The Council has banned exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capped imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.

U.S. President Donald Trump has met with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un three times, most recently in June when he became the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.

They agreed to resume stalled talks aimed at getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons program. The talks have yet to resume and in July and early August, North Korea carried out three short-range missiles tests in eight days.

When asked about the U.N. report a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said: “We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea’s ability to conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.”

The U.N. report was completed before last week’s missile launches by North Korea, but noted that “missile launches in May and July enhanced its overall ballistic missile capabilities.”

The U.N. experts said that despite the diplomatic efforts, they found “continued violations” of U.N. sanctions.

“For example, the DPRK continued to violate sanctions through ongoing illicit ship-to-ship transfers and procurement of WMD-related items and luxury goods,” the U.N. report said.",2019-08-05 18:28:34+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/expert-walmart-crypto-project-more-agreeable-to-lawmakers-than-libra,"A senior policy analyst at investment banking corporation Cowen, Jaret Seiberg, said that Walmart’s proposed digital coin should not face as much regulatory pushback as Libra, Facebook’s proposed virtual currency.

As Bloomberg reports on Aug. 5, Seiberg also added that Walmart’s crypto may have a demographic appeal to Democratic legislators who are keen to find an alternative financial infrastructure for people who do not regularly use banks.

According to Seiberg, Libra and Walmart’s crypto proposal differ in scale. Seiberg comments that Facebook has global intentions which do not appear to be shared by Walmart.

Possible regulatory hangups

However, Seiberg noted that Walmart’s proposal will not likely get automatic approval from Congress. He pointed out that, for instance, Walmart’s coin could be viewed as a threat to small banks and credit unions. Ultimately, though, Seiberg believes that lawmakers would eventually approve Walmart’s proposal.

Regarding the details of Walmart’s proposed currency, Seiberg wrote to clients on Monday that the currency may come in the form of a stored value card that is pegged to the U.S. dollar, somewhat like a rechargeable gift card.

Bloomberg reports that Walmart is not moving to roll out its cryptocurrency in the near future. According to the report, a Walmart spokesperson said on Friday that it is not planning to immediately take advantage of its newly-filed patent.

Walmart’s digital currency patent

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Walmart filed for a patent for a “System and Method for Digital Currency via Blockchain” that was published on Aug. 1. As outlined in the patent, Walmart appears to be filing for a standard, fiat-pegged stablecoin as outlined in the following passage:",,https://www.coindesk.com/mastercard-is-building-a-team-to-develop-crypto-wallet-projects,"Payments giant Mastercard is seeking to hire a number of blockchain professionals, including several senior roles, in an apparent effort to develop cryptocurrency and wallet products.

According to the company’s career website, Mastercard is looking for a senior blockchain engineer and engineering lead, director for product development and innovation, vice president for product management and director of product management for cryptocurrency and wallets.

Other senior roles Mastercard is looking to fill also mention expertise in the blockchain tech, for example, vice president of network tech product management, director of payments platform and networks, senior analyst for strategic program management and others.

The director of product management for cryptocurrency and wallets, according to the description, will be expected to “lead the ideation, definition, design, and development of innovative crypto currency solutions, including wallet solutions,” and have an experience in this field.

Along with the director for product development and innovation, vice president for product management, the wallet director is in charge of Mastercard’s patent portfolio and filing new patent applications. Other than that, there are few specifics about the new role, but the job description speaks of the crypto industry quite favorably, asking a potential candidate:

“Do you have the courage to look into the eyes of disruptive forces without fear, and maneuver them to your advantage?

Do you have the desire to work at the cutting-edge intersection of payments and crypto-currencies?

Do you have the ambition to build something which you can narrate to your grandchildren?”

If the answer is yes — Mastercard is the right place for such a candidate, the description suggests.

The new leadership team is further supposed to advocate blockchain concepts within Mastercard itself. According to the description of the director’s and VP positions, they will need to “establish shared vision across the company by influencing and building consensus among the various stakeholders.”

Mastercard is a member of the Libra Association — a loose cross-industry consortium tentatively supporting the launch of Facebook’s upcoming cryptocurrency, Libra. Facebook itself is now actively recruiting personnel for its native wallet, Calibra, but has pledged to allow free competition of wallets inside of the Libra ecosystem during the House and Senate hearings in July.

Bitcoin looks set to test falling channel resistance at $12,030, having invalidated a bearish lower-highs pattern earlier today.

The rise in bitcoin’s dominance rate to the highest level in over two years indicates the price rise is sustainable.

A UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the falling channel breakout and allow a rally to $13,880 (June 26 high).

The bull case would weaken if BTC closes today (UTC) below $11,120, although that looks unlikely.

Bitcoin (BTC) is eyeing a move to key resistance above $12,000, having broken out of a bearish pattern in the Asian trading hours today.

The leading cryptocurrency jumped above $11,120 at 00:45 UTC, violating the bearish lower-highs pattern created on July 20 and extended gains to $11,868 at 07:30 UTC. That’s BTC’s highest level since July 12, according to Bitstamp data.

With the price rise, BTC’s dominance rate – the cryptocurrency’s share of the total crypto market – has jumped to 67.9 percent, the highest level since April 12, 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.

Many observers consider price gains sustainable if they are backed by an uptick in the dominance rate.

For instance, Vinny Lingham, co-founder & CEO of identity protection and management startup Civic, put out a series of tweets on April 10, explaining how alternative cryptocurrencies decoupling from the BTC rally would be a sign of substance in the bull run.

With the dominance rate validating BTC’s 9.5 percent price rise in the last 24 hours, further gains toward resistance at $12,030 look likely. Technical indicators are also signaling a continuation of the price rise.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,710 on Bitstamp.

Daily and hourly charts

BTC’s move above the bearish lower-high of $11,120 (above left) is backed by a bullish above-50 reading on the relative strength index (RSI). Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram continues to gain altitude, another sign of strengthening bullish momentum.

What’s more, BTC has found acceptance above the 50-day moving average (MA). Also, the 5- and 10-day MAs are trending north, indicating a bullish setup.

As a result, a rise to the upper edge of the 1.5-month-long falling channel, currently at $12,030 looks likely. Supporting the bullish case is a pickup in the buying volumes (green bars), as seen on the hourly chart (above right).

A high-volume UTC close above $12,030 would confirm the channel breakout and open the doors to a retest of $13,880 (June 26 high).

The bullish case would weaken if BTC prints a UTC close below $11,120 today, leaving a daily candle with a long upper wick in its wake – a sign of buyer exhaustion.

That, however, looks unlikely, unless China’s yuan recovers lost ground.

It is worth noting that China’s offshore Yuan exchange rate (CNH) fell from 6.97 yuan per U.S. dollar to a multi-year low of 7.1085 per USD in the 60 minutes to 02:00 UTC today.

Meanwhile, BTC picked up a bid around $10,980 at 00:00 UTC – an hour before CNH began falling against the dollar, as seen in the chart below.

The price action seems to have convinced the crypto market community that yuan’s drop below the major psychological level of 7 per USD fueled a rally in BTC’s price – that is, wealthy Chinese investors rotated money into BTC amid the yuan’s depreciation.

Some observers, including prominent analyst Alex Kruger, wondered earlier today whether BTC had front-run the People’s Bank of China’s (central bank) decision to allow the yuan to slide beyond 7 per USD.

If that narrative continues to strengthen, then BTC may become vulnerable to a bounce, in yuan, if any. However, as of now, the yuan is showing little sign of life, currently trading at 7.08 per USD.

The litecoin blockchain reached the trigger block height of 1,680,000 at 10:16 UTC on Monday, according to the litecoin explorer from mining pool operator BTC.com.

The event marks a major threshold for miners, as the litecoin network is designed to reduce its mining rewards by half every 840,000 blocks (roughly every four years).

For this “halving,” the mining reward for every block has been reduced from the previous 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC.

Given the block production time on the litecoin network is around one block every 2.5 minutes, roughly 576 blocks are produced in every 24 hours with a new supply of 7,200 LTC entering into the market – half the previous daily level of around 14,400 LTC.

As of press time, about 63 million out of the total issuance of 84 million LTC are effectively in circulation, leaving about 21 million LTC block mining rewards – worth $2 billion at today’s prices – available for miners to compete for in the future.

Since early this year, LTC’s price has seen a significant uptick from around $30 in January to as much as $120 in June, but has since then decreased to around $100.

In line with the price increase ahead of the anticipated halving event, hash rate computing on the litecoin network and the mining difficulty have both jumped by 200 percent since end of December 2019.

The halving will likely have an affect on the interest in mining participation, as several widely used litecoin mining devices will now have a tough time generating enough LTC to offset electricity costs.

According to a miner profit index from f2pool, one of the world’s largest mining pools by hash rate, the three most profitable LTC miners made by InnoSilicon and FusionSilicon X6 had a profit margin of between 55 and 60 percent before Aug. 5.

Other older models such as Bitmain’s AntMiner L3, however, already had a profitability that was less than 50 percent based on an electricity cost of $0.04 per kWh and LTC’s price before the halving.

Holding everything else constant, reducing the mining revenue by half could lead to a net loss for miners with such older models, as Shixing Mao, co-founder of f2pool, said in a Weibo post:

“With an electricity cost of 0.26 yuan [$0.037] per kWh, miners like L3+ can pretty much just shut down tonight.”

Earlier this year, Bitcoin BTC was setting records for 12-month price highs. It’s also been demonstrating market dominance as it affirms its spot as the number one cryptocurrency.

But there’s another metric, hash rate, which has been reaching all time highs this year. But what is it? What does it mean? And why do people regard it as a measure of the network‘s health?

The hash rate low down

Put simply, hash rate is a general measure of the processing power of the Bitcoin network.

As Bitcoins are mined, blocks of verified transactions have to be “hashed” before being added to the ever growing chain of blocks, AKA the blockchain.

Each of these hashes is created by successfully completing an intentionally difficult mathematical puzzle. The hash rate, is a measure of how many times the network can attempt to complete this puzzle every second.

This means that hash rate is a good indicator of the Bitcoin network’s health. A high hash rate, when compared to a lower one, is preferable as it effectively means the network is more secure from 51-percent attacks.

The higher the hash power of the network, the greater the number of miners would be needed to commit a 51 percent attack.

So, a high hash rate makes it more logistically difficult to coordinate the number of computers required for such an attack. This is assuming that no one entity controls or owns a majority of the hash power of the network.

Ownership of hash power can be a concern. Research from October 2018, suggested that over 80 percent of Bitcoin mining was conducted by just six groups of miners, five of which are directly managed by individuals or companies from China. Theoretically, this gives China substantial power over the Bitcoin network.

It’s all kilos, megas, gigas, teras, exas, petas, and zettas

As mentioned, hash rate is measured in hashes per second, or H/s for short. At the time of writing (August 5, 2019), the hash rate is sitting around 74 EH/s… But wait, what’s an EH/s? I hear you scream.

Credit: Blockchain.com Bitcoin hash rate

As the Bitcoin network grows and can compute more hashes per second, its hash rate increases. The addition of more powerful, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) mining machines also increases the network‘s hash rate.

Over Bitcoin‘s 10-year life, the network has grown so powerful that it can compute quintillions of hashes every single second. For easy comprehension, 74 quintillion hashes per second is written as 74 EH/s.

It’s also common for hash rates of blockchain networks to be written in kH/s (one thousand ‘kilo’ hashes per second), MH/s (one million ‘mega’ hashes per second), GH/s (one billion ‘giga’ hashes per second), TH/s (one trillion ‘tera’ hashes per second), PH/s (on quadrillion ‘peta’ hashes per second), and ZH/s (one sextillion ‘zetta’ hashes per second).

Thing is, just because the Bitcoin network is getting more powerful doesn’t mean it verifies or mines blocks any quicker.

Bitcoin is programmed by design to mine a block about every 10 minutes, on average. It maintains this rate of production by adjusting the “mining difficulty” in line with the overall hash rate of the network.

In short, it makes it more difficult for miners to complete the hash puzzle. Generally speaking, as hash rate increase, so does Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, but that’s a topic for another day.",2019-08-05,,,

Bitcoin’s move above $12,000 is backed by an uptick in trading volumes and bullish readings on the daily chart.

BTC could close well above $12,000 today, confirming a falling channel breakout on the daily chart and extend gains toward $13,200 (July 10 high) in the short-term.

The 4-hour chart is reporting overbought conditions and a bearish indicator divergence. So, prices may pull back to $11,800–$11,600 and the bullish UTC close above $12,000 may be delayed till Wednesday.

The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below key average support, currently at $10,545, although that looks unlikely.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $12,000 for the first time in four weeks and is reporting gains for the eighth consecutive day.

The top cryptocurrency by market value rose above $12,000 at 06:45 UTC and soon hit a high of $12,298, the highest level since July 10, according to Bitstamp data.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $12,185 on Bitstamp, representing 3.26 percent gains on the daily opening price of $11,800. The cryptocurrency has scored 2–7 percent gains in each of the preceding seven days.

If BTC prints a UTC close above $11,800 today, then the resulting eight-day winning streak would be the longest since June. Back then, prices had rallied for eight straight days, starting from June 19 to June 26. Prior to that, BTC eked out gains for eight consecutive days in December 2017.

The latest winning run looks sustainable as it is accompanied by a rise in bitcoin’s dominance rate – the cryptocurrency’s share of the total cryptocurrency market. The gauge, as calculated by data source CoinMarketCap, currently stands at 68.5 percent, the highest level since April 2017.

Further, the cryptocurrency seems to have found acceptance above key resistance at $12,000, as seen in technical charts.

So, with the path of least resistance to the higher side, BTC could extend the ongoing rise toward the next major hurdle at $13,200 in the short-term.

Daily chart

BTC is currently trading above the upper edge of the falling channel, currently at $12,000. A UTC close above that level would confirm the breakout and signal a revival of the rally from lows near $4,000 seen on April 1.

The breakout looks likely as the 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are rising, indicating a bullish setup. The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) is also reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 print.

Further, the moving average convergence divergence histogram continues to produce higher highs above the zero line, a sign of strengthening bullish momentum.

And, last but not least, buying volumes (green bar) ticked higher yesterday, violating the downtrend line and validating the bullish move in prices.

So, the July 10 high of $13,200 could come into play over the next few days.

4-hour chart

The RSI on the 4-hour chart is reporting overbought conditions with an above-70 print, while the MACD has produced lower highs as opposed to higher highs on price (bearish divergence).

So, a brief pullback may precede a rally to $13,200. That said, the bullish case would weaken only if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance below the ascending 10-day MA, currently located at $10,545.

Seen by Reuters, the report – researched by “independent experts” and presented to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee last week – says that North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” hacks to collect roughly $2 billion, which is laundered over the web.

Reuters said the North Korean mission to the United Nations did not comment when asked about the report.

The experts are reportedly looking into “at least 35 reported instances of DPRK actors attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining activity designed to earn foreign currency” in around 17 nations. Many of North Korea’s hackers operate under the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency that handles clandestine operations.

The U.N. report said targeting crypto exchanges allowed North Korea “to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector.”

U.S. president Donald Trump has met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un several times in a bid to persuade the country to drop its nuclear weapons program.

Reuters said it asked a U.S. State Department spokeswoman about the U.N. report, and received the response:

“We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea’s ability to conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs.”

Previous reports have linked North Korea to major hacks at crypto exchanges.

A South Korean agency pointed the finger at its neighbor back in 2018 saying that domestic exchanges had been attacked with the loss of billions of won. It was investigating at the time if the rogue nation was behind the massive hack of Japan’s Coincheck exchange, which led to the theft of more than $500 million in cryptocurrency.

More recently, North Korean hackers were said to have been targeting users of the UPbit exchange with phishing email campaign.

Pyongyang image via Shutterstock",2019-08-06 08:15:12+00:00,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-idUSKCN1UW1RX,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s recent gains as stocks plummeted on U.S.-China trade tensions reflect not so much its safe-haven credentials but its potential for quick gains, cryptocurrency and foreign exchange traders said on Tuesday.

The biggest coin jumped over 7% on Monday as U.S. stocks slumped 3%. Safe haven assets from the Japanese yen to gold to government bonds - expected to hold or gain value amid turbulent markets - also rallied as investors fretted over the impact of the trade war on the world economy.

Crypto enthusiasts said the moves heralded bitcoin’s achieving its potential as a haven. Bitcoin, their argument goes, is immune to the impact of geopolitical tensions or government interference because of its decentralized nature.

Unlike government-issued fiat money, bitcoin is produced by miners across the world racing to solve computer puzzles. Its supply is also capped at 21 million, a scarcity aficionados say gives it an innate value, like rare metals.

And the correlation between falling stocks and rising bitcoin does appear to hold.

After major market-moving events over the last year, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s threat last week to slap more Chinese imports with tariffs, bitcoin has jumped as stocks tumbled.

(GRAPHIC - Bitcoin rallies when stocks sell-off: tmsnrt.rs/2YxZb8Y)

Since Trump's threat on Thursday, bitcoin BTC=BTSP has soared 23% versus a 4.6% slump in the S&P 500 .SPX. A week after the U.S. president tweeted in May that he would raise tariffs, bitcoin rose 41% against a 3.8% fall in U.S. stocks.

And when worries on a hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve amid escalating trade tensions and weakening future corporate earnings growth upset markets in December, bitcoin added 18% against a 10% drop for stocks in a week.

In times of market fluctuations, investors tend to move small proportions of their portfolios to bitcoin, said Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of London-based cryptocurrency platform Luno.

But driving bitcoin’s moves is less its safe haven characteristics than its potential for outsize gains, he added.

“If you’re wrong, you’re not losing lots of money, but if you’re right we are talking outsized returns,” said Swanepoel.

Like gold, bitcoin has also tended to move in concert with market volatility.

(GRAPHIC - Bitcoin, gold and volatility: tmsnrt.rs/2MFRo1u)

But any correlation with the behavior of traditional safe havens is likely more a short-term trend that an indication of anything longer-term, according to Forex.com analyst Fawad Razaqzada.

Bitcoin’s record of hacks and heists also undermines its credentials as a kin to gold, he said, adding that it does in theory have the potential to act as a haven.

“If exchanges solve the issue of cyber security, it could in the longer term be seen as a safe haven,” he said.",2019-08-06 15:35:38+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uks-tax-authority-requests-user-data-from-crypto-exchanges-report,"The United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC), has reportedly requested that digital currency exchanges provide it with information about customers’ names and transactions aiming to identify cases of tax evasion.

Crypto exchanges come under fire

According to fintech-focused media outlet Coindesk, industry sources said that the agency has sent letters to at least three crypto exchanges in the U.K., including Coinbase, eToro and CEX.io, requesting that they provide lists of users and transaction data.

HMRC is reportedly aiming to cooperate with crypto exchanges in a bid to identify individuals who evade taxes. According to the cited sources, the agency will probably only go back two or three years:

“If they do only go back two or three years, I think the interesting thing here is, that the individuals who went into crypto very early on in 2012-13 will not be affected. The ones who probably made the largest gains won’t be affected, it will be the people who came in around the time crypto peaked.”

HMRC reportedly confirmed that such requests are within the scope of its competence, specifically claiming:

“These exchanges can retain information on their clients and the transactions that they have completed. These transactions may result in potential tax charges and HMRC has the power to issue notices requiring exchanges to provide this information.”

Last December, HMRC published its first detailed tax legislation for private cryptocurrency holders following a lengthy consultation period. Specifically, it demands that individuals paid either Capital Gains Tax or Income Tax depending on the type of cryptocurrency transactions they are involved in.

Matter of international significance

HMRC’s move echoes the United States Internal Revenue Service’s, when it sent letters to 10,000 crypto investors, asking some to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and/or interest and penalties. The revenue service states that the letters should be delivered by the end of August.

Cointelegraph reported that beginning Aug. 1, Brazil citizens are obligated to report on their crypto transactions with the country’s tax authority, the Department of Federal Revenue. The measure applies to individuals, companies and brokerages, and includes all kinds of crypto-related activities, including buying and selling, as well as donations, barters, deposits, and withdrawals etc.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/israeli-btc-investors-cant-pay-taxes-as-banks-refuse-deposit,"Israeli Bitcoin (BTC) investors are unable to pay their taxes as banks do not accept deposits obtained from cryptocurrencies.

Israeli banks freeze up the minute they hear Bitcoin

Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports on Aug. 6 that local crypto investors are unable to deposit the returns of their Bitcoin investments into bank accounts due to money laundering and terrorist financing concerns. Bitcoin is not recognized as a currency in Israel and earnings made by trading them are subject to a 25% capital gains tax for individuals and a 47% corporate tax rate for corporations.

Those two factors reportedly result in the Israel Tax Authority expecting taxes from Bitcoin investors, who find themselves incapable of paying them since they cannot deposit the earnings resulting from their investments as local fiat currency onto local bank accounts. The outlet outlines the experience of local BTC investor Ron Gross, who invested in the coin in 2011 and reported his earnings to the local tax authority.

In 2017, his bank, Hapoalim, reportedly started refusing to allow him to deposit his Bitcoin trading profits into the account. Gross also met with bank officers and showed them 70 pages of deposit records of Bitcoin earnings, but the bank continued to refuse to accept the funds. He stated:

“I’ve tried working with almost all the banks, but the minute they hear the word ‘Bitcoin’ they freeze up.”

Tax authorities aware of the problem

Since he was unable to pay his dues to the Israeli tax authority, a lien has been put on his bank account, home, and scooters. He also declared that “the tax authority is aware of the problem, but they say the ball isn’t in their court.”

Haaretz further writes that the local tax collector is aware of 300 million shekels (over $85.7 million) in unpaid tax due on the earnings from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but the figure is probably much higher.

The outlet also cites the case of Roy Arav, another Bitcoin investor who held his profits on a trustee account at Discount bank operated by local cryptocurrency exchange Bit2C. Still, Discount refuse to move the money from the trustee account to Arav’s personal account.

The reason behind the refusal is that the bank’s policy does not permit funds in client accounts deriving from distributed virtual currencies due to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Because of this, Arav could not pay his taxes and filed a lawsuit against the bank.

He also reportedly admitted that the tax authority understood the problem and let him delay paying until the lawsuit he filed could be ruled on. Lastly, the outlet admits that there are ways to circumvent the issue by buying shekels in the grey markets or move money through investment houses, paying high fees.

Skilled blockchain developers are a scarce commodity, as precious as the bitcoins that reside on the distributed ledgers they maintain. Teach yourself one of the major blockchain programming languages and you’ll be set for life, though like anything worth having, this achievement won’t come easy. If you’re contemplating becoming a blockchain dev, here’s how to get started.

Learn Your Languages and Know Your Code

The crypto community is comprised of a series of tribes, each fiercely loyal to its anointed coin. Become a blockchain developer, however, and you’ll be able to transcend these artificial boundaries, because good code is good code, and if you can create bug-proof smart contracts and weed out vulnerabilities, you’ll never find yourself out of a job. Satoshi wrote Bitcoin in C++ and it remains one of the most popular and versatile blockchain programming languages to this day. Java, Python, Ruby, Rust, Solidity, Go, and C# are all to be found within the cryptosphere, however, anchoring crypto networks at the base layer.

If you’re intent on becoming a blockchain developer, but don’t know a compiler from a smart contract, a good place to start is by attending a hackathon. Cryptocurrency projects regularly hold these events to encourage developers to build upon their ecosystem and to inspire new use cases and applications. Aeternity’s Big Bang Event, scheduled to take place in Prague on September 20-21, for instance, will bring together 500 participants including developers, entrepreneurs, students, and big tech minds to discuss scaling solutions. Events such as these provide an ideal opportunity to meet like-minded souls and to pick up tips on how to enter the industry.

As Aeternity Crypto Foundation board member Emin Mahrt observed, “Everyone is absolutely welcome to attend … We’d be very delighted to meet as many like-minded tech builders and curious dreamers as possible. You never know which of the people you meet will someday become the founder of an industry-breaking product.” Hackathons are a great place for emerging devs, aspiring devs and potential devs who are mooting the wisdom of becoming a full-time blockchain engineer.

The Pros and Cons of Formal Education

Do you have a degree? If you could go back in time, would you swap it for a more useful one – like Computer Science? Or would you ditch it altogether to be free of your student loan and to spend your time doing something more productive? Today, many would-be students are questioning the wisdom of a formal education in an age where you can obtain the same learning for free from Youtube. While there are some fields, such as the social sciences, where academic learning presents the best route to career advancement, that’s not necessarily the case with tech. If you can code, no one cares where you acquired your skills. A prestigious alma mater means nothing when there’s debugging to be done and the clock is ticking.

While the wisdom of pursuing tertiary education is a matter for you to ponder, it’s worth noting that there are now university courses based around blockchain. These include Blockchain at Berkeley – a student-run organization that offers courses on and off campus – and Princeton’s Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies online course, which has attracted several hundred thousand signups to date. It’s free, but it’s also just 18 hours and – spoiler alert – becoming an expert blockchain developer takes longer than a weekend.

University may not be the fastest way to become a blockchain dev, but it shouldn’t be discounted altogether. Besides, there’s more than one way to use educational institutions as a springboard to a job in the cryptosphere. Yannis Stamelakos is a blockchain engineer at Tokencard. “I started my career in academia, doing research on embedded systems which led me to obtain a PhD in computer architecture, focusing on near-threshold computing for low-power manycore systems,” he told news.Bitcoin.com. “I was always fascinated by blockchain technology and so hardware wallets were the perfect entry point.”

From there, Stamelakos gained work with Provable, writing apps for Ledger’s Nano S, generating authenticity proofs that could be validated on-chain. “We were actually working on creating an ideal infrastructure for building oracles that could fetch data to the blockchain in a trustless way. This served as a perfect stepping stone for my role at TokenCard as a Blockchain Engineer,” he finished.

How to Become a Self-Taught Blockchain Developer

For autodidacts, going it alone is the best way to learn the ropes and then master them. If you’ve got the discipline to study and the willpower to avoid firing up crypto Twitter every time your concentration lapses, you’ll find the web to be awash with all the tools and tutorials it takes to become an accomplished cryptocurrency developer. Bitcoin dev Jameson Lopp’s resources page is rich in links to portals for genning up on BTC tech. Udemy’s video courses are also well worth checking out.

While there are ideological differences between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash, from an architectural perspective the two cryptocurrencies are very similar. Thus, the skills you learn from BTC-oriented sites are equally applicable to BCH. For BCH proponents, this knowledge can then be augmented by heading to the developer section of Bitcoin.com. The Learn section is the best place to start. Here, you’ll find step by step instructions on how to build Bitcoin Cash apps from scratch and can view real world examples that can be deployed as your own working copies from which to bootstrap your project. You’ll also find Mastering Bitcoin Cash, based on the acclaimed Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.

In the future, we’ll all be replaced by robots and AI, but in the here and now, there’s a demand for skilled humans to maintain the current generation of crypto networks and to create new applications and layered solutions built upon decentralized technologies. If that’s you, stop dreaming and start studying.

Speaking with CNBC on Tuesday, businessman and co-host of NBC’s “Shark Tank” Kevin O’Leary and Morgan Creek Digital’s Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano took opposing sides in the conversation. Pompliano is a well-known bitcoin bull, while O’Leary played the role of skeptic.

Over the course of the conversation, Pompliano said over half of his net worth now resides in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by total value. O’Leary sought to describe the investment strategy as foolish in return.

“In any one stock, never more than 5 percent, in any one sector, never more than 20 percent,” O’Leary said. “I teach this stuff! You never go beyond concentrations of that nature! Fifty percent! Shame on you! That’s nuts!”

Responding to bitcoin’s role as a safe haven, Pompliano said the asset is negatively correlated with every other major asset class.

“[Morgan Creek Digital] has been banging the drum for over a year now saying that this is a non-correlated asymmetric asset. If you look at times of global instability like in May, where we are lobbing tariff threats and the trade wars are going on, bitcoin is up 55 percent. It’s got a negative correlation, -0.9 to S&P negative -0.8 to gold.”

O’Leary’s main point concerned alternative cryptocurrencies.

“If this is really such a great idea, why is there really only one Vegas game working?” he asked.

Two years ago, O’Leary explained, he purchased $100 of various cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, XRP, ethereum, and stellar lumens. His holdings are down about 70 percent.

Pompliano responded by saying no exposure to the asset class was irresponsible for financial institutions, a claim he’s frequently voiced via his popular Twitter account.

CNBC’s segment on bitcoin as a safe haven was an extension of the currency discussion occurring around China. Yesterday, the United States labelled China a currency manipulator.

The U.S. announcement fell on the heels of reports between Chinese capital fleeing into alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. A recent report by CoinDesk said between $10 and $30 million Tether daily trade volume is conducted in Moscow from mostly Chinese accounts.

Cardano is a cryptocurrency network and open source platform that uses the Outboros proof-of-stake technology to provide a more secure blockchain that is less prone to tampering. Cardano’s underlying technology also allows developers to execute end-to-end tests on their programs without deploying the code. The goal of the Cardano network is to create and run a public blockchain platform for smart contract-derived applications.

Cardano’s system runs on its underlying coin — Ada, which is traded on major exchanges and holds value. If you’re passionate about the Cardano network project and its technology, investing in the Cardano coin can be an excellent way to both support the project and potentially earn money if the price of the coin rises in value as interest increases.

Expand your token holdings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum with Cardano. Our guide can show you how to buy Cardano and help you determine where and how you should store the coins you purchase for maximum security.

Step 1: Open an Online Account

The 1st step to purchasing Cardano is to open an account with a crypto broker that supports the Cardano token. After creating and funding your account, you’ll instruct your broker to use your fiat funds to purchase the tokens you’re interested in using an order.

Opening an account with a crypto broker is very simple. To get started, gather a bit of your personal information. When you 1st open your account, you’ll usually need to provide:

Your full legal name

Your current address

An email address and phone number

Some form of payment method to fund your account (most brokers support both credit cards and direct banks transfers)

A copy of some form of photo ID (most brokers accept driver’s licenses and passports)

After you have your information ready, choose a broker that supports the purchase and sale of Cardano. If you aren’t sure where to begin, consider a few of our top choices below.

Coinbase

If you’re completely new to cryptocurrency, you’ll probably appreciate Coinbase’s straightforward, beginner-friendly platform. Coinbase makes it especially easy to sign up for your account — most users will be able to get started in as little as 2 minutes. As soon as your account is set up, you can place orders and track your portfolio through Coinbase’s desktop platform or mobile app.

Coinbase’s Earn feature allows you to earn a little cryptocurrency by learning more about its offerings. Watch a few videos on the coins and tokens currently supported by the broker, then take a quiz on the technology that backs each project. You’ll earn a little crypto each time you get an answer right!

Step 2: Buy a Wallet

After you open your broker account, you’ll need to select a wallet to store your cryptocurrency on. While you can store your crypto on your broker’s trading platform, keeping your coins in a private wallet will greatly decrease the possibility of losing money to a hack.

There are 2 major types of cryptocurrency wallets:

Hot storage. Hot storage wallets are wallets that must connect to the internet in order to show you your coin balance.

Hot storage wallets are wallets that must connect to the internet in order to show you your coin balance. Cold storage. Cold storage wallets are cryptocurrency wallets that are not connected to the internet.

Hot wallets are easier to access and hold more tokens but are more susceptible to hackers. We recommend using a cold storage wallet for the highest possible level of security. Here are a few of our favorite cold storage wallets to consider for your Cardano coins.

Best for Crypto Choice: Ledger Nano X

If you’re looking for a 1-stop-shop for all of your crypto cold storage, the Ledger Nano X might be the right choice for you. The Nano X supports over 1,200 individual cryptocurrencies, and you can install upwards of 100 decentralized apps on your device.

The Nano X even offers Bluetooth compatibility, which makes it easier to transfer your coins after you make a new purchase. With a wide range of application choices, highly secure cold storage and easy connectivity features, the Nano X’s $118 price tag can be worth the expense.

Best for Touch Screen Displays: Trezor Model T

The Trezor Model T is another popular cold storage option, with cutting edge technology and secure cold storage for your coins. The Trezor Model T features a quick and easy setup, which can have you managing your coins in as little as 3 steps and a few minutes.

The Model T’s most notable feature is its large touchscreen display, which makes it easier to manage your coins without connecting to a computer.

Step 3: Make Your Purchase

Once your account is open and your wallet is set up, it’s finally time to purchase Cardano. You’ll purchase Cardano by placing an order through your broker using its unique trading platform.

Most brokers allow you to choose between multiple order types, and the order type you choose when you place your order will determine how much you’ll pay for each coin that you purchase.

Here are 2 of the most common types of orders your broker might offer access to:

Market order. A market order tells your broker that you want to purchase a set number of Cardano coins at the current market rate. When you place a market order, you’ll only need to specify which coin you’re buying and how many coins you want to purchase. Your broker will then fill the order as soon as possible.

Market orders are more likely to be filled than other types of orders like limit orders because they don’t specify a price your order must be executed at. However, you might pay more for each coin than you see on your brokerage platform because market conditions can change at any moment.

Limit order. A limit order tells your broker that you want to purchase a set number of Cardano coins but only at or below a specific price. When you place a limit order, you’ll need to specify which coin you’re buying, how many coins you want to purchase, and the maximum price that you’re willing to pay for each coin.



For example, if you place a limit order for 300 Cardano coins at $.10, your broker will fill your order if they can purchase each coin for $.10 or less. If the market price moves above $.10, the broker will not fill your order.

Limit prices allow you to implement strict controls over how much you pay per coin. However, if the market price moves above your limit price, you might not have the opportunity to purchase the tokens you’ve ordered.

After you place your order, your broker will execute the order if possible. When your order is executed, you’ll see your coins in your brokerage account.

Trade or Sell Your Cryptocurrency

After your order closes, you’ll need to decide whether you want to become an active cryptocurrency trader or if you want to hold onto your coins and sell them at a later date. If you want to trade your cryptocurrency, keep track of how the Cardano market is moving and convert it to a stablecoin (like Tether) when the price rises.

Most cryptocurrency traders then hold onto their stablecoin until the price of Cardano falls again. The goal of trading is to accumulate more Cardano coins or to cash out the differences in their stablecoins.

If you decide to hold onto your Cardano, you should move your coins to a cold storage wallet. This provides you with private keys necessary to access your coins and prevents the possibility of a hack. When you decide to sell your coins, transfer your coins from your cold storage back to your trading account and convert them back to fiat currency.

There are thousands of cryptocurrencies on the market, and no single broker can carry all options. If you know that you want to add multiple cryptos to your portfolio, be sure that your broker supports the coins you’re interested in. You might need to purchase multiple wallets to support all of your coins depending on the options you choose.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, the correlation between Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, and physical gold has almost doubled in the past three months.

While the seminal cryptocurrency is down today, it has been in a general uptrend for the past several months, as more investors are using it as a hedge or safe haven from financial instability fomented by geopolitical tensions.

Ether (ETH) is holding onto its position as the largest altcoin by market cap, which currently stands at $23.8 billion. The second-largest altcoin, Ripple’s XRP, has a market cap of $13.1 billion at press time.

Coin360 data shows that Ether has seen its value decrease by about 2.4% over the last 24 hours. At press time, Ether is trading around $224.47. On the week, the coin is up almost 4%.

Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, the one reporting the most notable price movements is Binance Coin (BNB) which is up about 5.82%. At press time, the biggest loser among the top 20 coins is Litecoin (LTC), which is down 6.89% on the day to trade at $89.22.

At press time, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is $297 billion, according to Coin360.

In traditional markets, the United States stock market is seeing slight losses so far today, with the S&P 500 down 0.67% and the Nasdaq down 0.38% at press time. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), on the other hand, has gained 2.78% on the day at press time.

Major oil futures and indexes are seeing losses today, with WTI Crude down 4.53%, Brent Crude down 4.26% and Mars US down 2.36% at press time. The OPEC Basket is down 1.37% and the Canadian Crude Index has lost 46.45% over the 24 hours by press time, according to OilPrice.com.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-correlation-with-gold-nearly-doubled-in-past-3-months,"The correlation between digital and physical gold has almost doubled in the past three months, fresh data from Bloomberg revealed on Aug. 7.

The statistics reveal that while the correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold over the past year was at 0.496, in the past three months this has almost doubled to hit 0.837 — where a coefficient of +1 indicates perfect correlation, and -1 complete non-correlation.

58% lockstep since May

Bloomberg notes that over the past year, the correlation between the assets has been random: with the two assets trading inversely 49% of the time, in a correlated downturn 22% of the time and in a correlated uptrend 29% of the time. Yet since May 8 of this year, their trading in tandem has surged to 58%.

The article notes the caveat that 3 months is a relatively minor data set, as well as the fact that correlation does not imply causation. Moreover, its author argues that stablecoin Tether (USDT) — rather than purely market forces — has a significant impact on the price of Bitcoin and the liquidity of crypto markets.

Nonetheless, the present geopolitical and macroeconomic climate plays into a possible interpretation of the data. The article notes the adverse impact of escalating trade tensions between the United States and China on the world economy — against which, as investor Tim Draper argued earlier this week, Bitcoin can offer a “remarkable hedge.”

The safe-haven asset of the digital age

Mounting recognition of Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset is being spurred by the relevance of its non-sovereign characteristics amid an unpredictable geopolitical backdrop. The coin is “doing exactly what it's designed for today,” cryptocurrency and blockchain lawyer Jake Chervinsky argued earlier this week.

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of crypto payments firm Circle, has this week said that macroeconomic turmoil is driving the price appreciation of Bitcoin as “a non-sovereign, highly secure mechanism to store value that can exist anywhere the internet exists.”

Macro factors — including central banks’ dovish policy turn — have also been cited in relation to Bitcoin’s bullish price performance by various analysts in recent weeks.

While this broad sentiment has been recently echoed by Morgan Creek Digital Assets founder Antony Pompliano, he conversely noted that Bitcoin’s unique value might be best preserved if it preserves its “non-correlation to the rest of the markets, especially in times of global instability.”",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-tax-bill-introduced-in-the-us-house-of-representatives,"A tax bill seeking to allow the exclusion of gain or loss on like-kind exchanges of virtual currency has been introduced in the United States House of Representatives.

To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986

The bill, dubbed the “Virtual Value Tax Fix Act of 2019,” was initially introduced by Representative Ted Budd (NC-R) on July 25 and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. The bill seeks to introduce amendments to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which specifically determines:

“No gain or loss shall be recognized on the exchange of real property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if such real property is exchanged solely for real property of like kind which is to be held either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment.”

The aim of the bill is to ensure that “the exchange of virtual currency for virtual currency of like kind shall be treated in the same manner as the exchange of real property for real property of like kind.”

In effect, if the bill became law, it would preclude cryptocurrencies from double taxation under the Internal Revenue Code.

“The Safe Harbor”

In July, U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer reintroduced his Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets bill in order to foster blockchain industry growth in the U.S. by lessening the burden on businesses to figure out relevant tax laws. In Emmer’s own words, “taxpayers can only comply with the law when the law is clear.”

The Safe Harbor bill is not intended to eliminate taxes on a hard-forked blockchain, but aims to provide a safe harbor to investors who do not properly account for a hard fork in calculating their tax returns.

Budd previously testified to the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on purported issues with current tax laws on cryptocurrencies in June. Budd argued that cryptocurrencies should have a de minimis tax exemption like foreign currencies.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/07/coinbase-faces-negligence-suit-after-mishandling-its-launch-of-bitcoin-cash/,"Long-standing cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase will face a negligence lawsuit after allegedly mismanaging the launch of Bitcoin Cash BCH on its platform, a judge has ruled.

However, court documents released on Tuesday show that US District Judge Vince Chhabria threw fraud and unfair competition charges relating to the case.

Bitcoin Cash was borne out of a Bitcoin fork in 2017 and then split off into two subsequent cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin Cash SV, the following year.

This move marks the latest advance in a protracted lawsuit filed by Jeffery Berk in the aftermath of BCH’s launch.

The issue resides around the fact that Coinbase allowed US dollar orders for BCH, but suspended them after just a couple of minutes, citing “significant volatility”. As a result, prices jumped in the hours before the cryptocurrency was added to the exchange. It prompted market observers to claim this was evidence of potential insider trading.

“The fact that Coinbase halted trading within three minutes of the launch is indicative of dysfunction,” the judge said.

“The buyers have also identified precautions Coinbase could have taken to avert the massive spike in the price of Bitcoin Cash on its exchange. Most prominently, Coinbase could have announced its launch of trading in Bitcoin Cash more than an hour in advance, which would have permitted more buyers and sellers to place limit orders,” he added.

“That way, Coinbase could have ensured the liquidity and market capitalization needed for an orderly market. Coinbase instead launched trading while only purchase orders were pending. And the buyers have alleged a plausible motive for Coinbase’s seemingly rushed decision to launch under subpar conditions,” concluded Chhabria.

Hard Fork contacted Coinbase for comment but did not receive a reply by press time.",2019-08-07,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-to-bring-crypto-exchanges-under-direct-regulation,"The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea's Financial Services Commission has revealed plans to bring cryptocurrency exchanges under its direct regulation.

On Aug. 7, Business Korea reported on the FIU’s decision to shift away from its current practice of regulating crypto exchanges indirectly by providing administrative guidance to domestic banks.

A shift away from indirect regulation

In order to bring crypto exchanges into the country’s regulatory system, an FIU official revealed on Aug. 6 that the South Korean government will introduce a crypto exchange licensing system, as recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). This will reportedly enhance the transparency of cryptocurrency transactions.

At a public hearing held at the National Assembly Member's Office in Seoul, Lee Tae-hoon — who serves as head of administration and planning at the FIU — stated:

“If an amendment to the Act on Reporting and Use of Certain Financial Transaction Information, which reflects the FATF’s international standards for cryptocurrencies, passes the National Assembly, it will be possible to prevent money laundering through cryptocurrencies.”

Lee added that should lawmakers approve the decision to shift away from “indirect regulation through commercial banks to direct regulation,” oversight of the sector would be more effective.

Commentators reportedly noted that regulatory amendments would need to integrate existing stipulations, which hold that banks must issue real-name accounts to crypto exchanges. This would ensure that crypto exchanges adhere to the same know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering standards as traditional financial institutions.

Impact of FATF guidance

This week’s news aligns with recent unofficial reports that four South Korean crypto exchanges were facing stricter regulation as they attempted to renew their banking accounts.

The tightened requirements were reportedly imposed in the wake of the FATF’s new June 2019 guidance for strengthening control over crypto exchanges in order to better combat money laundering.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-startups-still-raising-millions-in-capital-despite-ico-decline,"In late July 2019, Sony Financial Ventures joined a $14.5 million funding round for Bitcoin (BTC) bank Bitwala. Back in 2017 and 2018, such a figure might not have made many headlines, as crypto startups were raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in initial coin offerings (ICOs).

The ICO boom has, however, stalled significantly, with fundraising figures for 2019 a far cry from the massive amounts earned by projects in the two years prior. Many of the tokens that came about during the ICO mania have also lost most of their post-offering value. Since the late 2017 crypto mania, there has been a considerable uptick in regulatory scrutiny of the industry as a whole.

While the ICO boom might have waned since the middle of 2018, there is still a lot of activity in the crypto fundraising space. The only difference is that, like much of the broader industry, the prevailing narrative appears to be taking on a paradigm shift — one that crypto proponents hope is tending toward making cryptocurrencies a more mature asset class.

Major ICOs of 2019

Data from ICO analytics firm ICOdata.io shows that token sales have raised more than $340 million in 2019 from 83 crypto fundraising events. Monthly figures for 2019 can be seen in the chart below.

To put the ICO decline in perspective, token sales raised more than $900 million in June 2018 alone. On the whole, 2018 saw ICOs raise more than $7.8 billion from a total of 1,253 projects. In the previous year, 853 projects collected over $6.2 billion from token sales. So far, only March and May 2019 have recorded more than $100 million in ICO sales. The following are some of the major ICOs in 2019.

Tron Game Global raised about $80 million in its ICO, which took place between mid-April and mid-June 2019. The project focuses on developing blockchain-based internet decentralization protocols.

Algorand managed to raise close to $60 million during its June 17 ICO. The crypto project seeks to utilize proof-of-stake (PoS) in ensuring instant and scalable transaction processing. Coinbase recently announced plans to list the token along with seven others as part of its catalog expansion.

Coti earned $15 million during its June 4 to July 3 ICO sale. The blockchain payment protocol is aiming to connect merchants, governments, stablecoin issuers, etc.

Reports also emerged that Telegram would be conducting the public phase of its billion-dollar ICO. Back in 2018, Telegram raised $1.7 billion for its Telegram Open Network (TON) project — the second-highest-grossing token sale behind EOS, which pulled in $4 billion.

In an email to Cointelegraph, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital — a crypto and blockchain hedge fund firm — commented on the factors that contributed to the decline of ICOs. According to DiPasquale:

“The ICO market was largely driven by greed, as speculators scrambled, hoping to find the next ETH. Unfortunately, the space was rife with scams as people soon realized they could raise hundreds of thousands if not millions, with vague promises and plagiarized whitepapers. Without a solid foundation, the bubble was destined to pop, and it is unlikely we will return to the ICO hype of 2017 and 2018. Instead, however, we may see a more standardized approach to crowdfunding develop, as is the case with security token offerings, which are in the works.”

ICO alternatives taking center stage?

Within the current narrative of a decline in ICOs, some commentators believe that there is significant interest in the sale of cryptocurrency tokens as an investment in blockchain-based startups. In a private correspondence with Cointelegraph, Igor Chugunov, CEO of Credits — a blockchain startup that focuses on decentralized application (DApps) development — declared that there is a continued interest in ICOs.

For Chugunov, there are still individual and corporate investors looking to put up equity in emerging projects that aim to use put blockchain technology to innovative uses across several aspects of the global business process. Providing further commentary on the matter, the Credits CEO added in an email to Cointelegraph that ICOs are now evolving into security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs), declaring:

“Yes, we have to admit that the volume of fund-raising through ICOs has declined significantly. But let's take into account that ICO is just a tool that is being improved and assumes new formats like STOs and IEOs. Innovative approaches to raising funds is an integral part of modern market realities. In my opinion, the decline in interest in such instruments like ICO is primarily associated with the strengthening positions of regulators in the market and the investor's transition to a new degree of his evolution in the areas of market research, risk management, and capital management.”

The current cryptocurrency investment climate

With ICOs experiencing a massive decline, the narrative has shifted to other fundraising methods for cryptocurrency startups. Back in mid-June, Cointelegraph reported on Fireblocks — a digital asset cybersecurity startup — raising about $16 million in a Series A funding round from venture capitalists (VCs).

Amid the ICO mania, there have also been companies that have steadily accrued capital funding via VCs. Some of the major crypto-businesses like Circle and Coinbase have received millions of dollars from VC investors at different points in time. Commenting on the VC approach to investing in the digital asset space, DiPasquale surmised:

“VCs and seasoned investors in the crypto space are not attracted to hype. They seek solid teams with sound ideas and take a milestone-based approach to investments. Even in private rounds, they seek early entries to ensure maximum ROI and low risk. The general narrative is to identify new protocols and services which allow interoperability between various blockchains and support building infrastructures on top of them.”

Despite the crypto winter of 2018 that saw prices of digital tokens plummet by more than 80% across the market, VCs continued to invest in cryptocurrency projects. VCs reported invested more than $2.85 billion in crypto and blockchain projects in 2018.

While this figure might seem significant, it pales in comparison to the total outlay of VC equity investments in businesses throughout 2018. Data from Crunchbase shows that VCs put up more than $350 billion in private funding rounds. Echoing DiPasquale’s sentiments, Chugunov provided further explanation as to why VC involvement in the crypto space is still relatively insignificant, opining:

“Venture capital has not lost its interest in investing in cryptocurrencies, but the requirements for projects, in particular for products, teams, economic models and adhering to the roadmaps have grown significantly.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, cryptocurrency lender BlockFi has received about $18 million in Series A funding from VCs led by Peter Thiel’s Valar. The growing pre-eminence of venture funding in the crypto space also lends itself to sensible investments in projects that could possibly turn out to be economically viable. According to a previous Cointelegraph report, BlockFi has more than $53 million in customer cryptocurrency assets under management.

This arguably sensible investment strategy is in stark contrast to the high yield investment product vibe of the ICO era.

The measure announced Wednesday by Attorney General Gurbir Grewal is part of the international crackdown on cryptocurrencies known as “Operation Cryptosweep.”

Since May 2018, securities regulators have opened 130 separate investigations into businesses’ “initial coin offerings,” which are the crypto-market’s equivalent of the initial public offering that companies going public and entering the stock market offer to investors.

The most popular and well-known crypto-coin is Bitcoin, which like any other form of cryptocurrency can fluctuate wildly during short time-frames. Bitcoin started at several hundred dollars in 2014, peaking at nearly $20,000 per Bitcoin in December 2017 before reaching a low point of $8,000 last December. It is now valued at roughly $12,000 per Bitcoin.

This fluctuation could provide an enormous risk to investors, as could its lack of state and federal regulation—something regulators have grappled with in recent years.

“With the price of Bitcoin increasing over the last few months and the announcement of Facebook’s Libra, there has been a sharp increase in public solicitations to invest in crypto-related products that appear on their face to be suspect,” state Bureau of Securities Chief Chris Gerold said Wednesday in a statement.

“The two actions today are a reminder to investors that investing in cryptocurrencies or crypto-related products have significant risks and investors must do their diligence before investing,” he added.

But proponents of cryptocurrency argue the new system of currency is an easy way to transfer money between parties while avoiding the need to go through banks and other third-party financial institutions.

Cryptocurrencies are not issued by a central authority such as a government body, according to Investopedia, making them attractive because of their potential immunity to the ebb and flow of international and domestic politics.

Zoptax, according to Grewal’s office, sold unregistered “Zoptax Coins” to investors with the goal of raising up to $3.4 million for business ventures. The coins were not registered with the state’s Bureau of Securities, the OAG said.

In addition, Zoptax lied about how it would use the money, its assets and liabilities, who actually developed Zoptax and its coins, financial risks with Zoptax, and that the coins were not registered with the state.

Unocall, like Zoptax, also did not register with New Jersey regulators in the case of its “Staking Program” that would allow investors to buy and trade Unocall tokens, according to Grewal’s office. The site provides very little information about who works for the company, the OAG said.

Neither companies returned a request for comment.

“While not every initial coin offering or cryptocurrency-related investment is fraudulent, there are significant risks involved with these products,” Division of Consumer Affairs Acting Director Paul Rodriguez said in a statement. “Investors must be on alert and not be tempted to invest in cryptocurrency-related investments without first vigorously vetting any transaction.”

Last month, the state’s Bureau of Securities unveiled a lawsuit against Princeton-based blockchain online rental marketplace Pocketinns, Inc. and its president, Sarvajnya Mada, for selling over $400,000 in unregistered cryptocurrency to New Jersey investors, Grewal’s office said.",2019-08-07 14:38:01+00:00,https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/9671589/bitcoin-investors-chased-hmrc-tax/,"PEOPLE who buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being warned to check if they need to pay tax on any windfalls they make amid an HMRC crackdown.

Experts say the move follows a similar investigation launched by the USA's Internal Revenue System (IRS).

HMRC wouldn't tell us which firms it's spoken to but CEX.IO told The Sun that it's been contacted by the tax man.

The crypto exchange says it's been asked for the names and addresses of UK residents who've transferred cash using the site between April 6 2017 and April 5 2019 - as well as the value and dates of transfers.

CEX.IO says it's now investigating whether it has to meet the tax man's demands.

How much tax do I have to pay on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies? YOU don't have to pay tax when you buy bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the UK, but you might have to pay tax when you come to sell it. Capital gains and income tax might be due Everyone has an annual tax-free capital gains allowance of £12,000, but earn more than this by selling cryptocurrency and tax will be due. Basic rate taxpayers will be charged 10 per cent in capital gains tax, while it's 20 per cent for higher or additional rate taxpayers. And it's worth pointing out that this £12,000 tax-free allowance isn't just for bitcoin and cryptocurrency - it covers any ""gain"" or profit you make from selling anything from investments to property to art work. If you're trading bitcoin or cryptocurrency so frequently that you're effectively running it as a business, you may need to pay income tax instead of capital gains tax. Income is taxed at 20 per cent for earnings between £12,501 and £50,000, at 40 per cent on £50,001 to £150,000 and at 45 per cent on anything you earn over £150,000. How to pay tax on bitcoin earnings If you're earning more than these limits above you need to declare it to HMRC by completing a self-assessment tax return. You can do this online or by post. The postal deadline for the 2018/19 financial year is October 31 2019 or January 31 2020 if you file online. You can be fined up to £1,000 for failing to file a self-assessment tax return on time, although HMRC says it will make exceptions for those who have made a genuine mistake. Reduce your tax bill But Gary McFarlane, a cryptocurrency expert at investment platform Interactive Investor, points out that there are ways to minimise tax. For example, you can effectively double your tax-free capital gains allowance to £24,000 by giving the assets to your spouse or partner. Mr McFarlane adds that you can also deduct any losses from your gains to lower your bill. If you're unsure about any of this, contact HMRC or speak to a tax advisor.

Platform Coinbase refused to confirm or deny reports that it too has been hauled up by HMRC. Back in February it was ordered following a lengthy court battle to divulge the details of 13,000 customers to the IRS.

Another platform The Sun spoke to called CoinCorner says it's not heard anything from HMRC but adds that it's ""aware"" other firms have been contacted.

Gary McFarlane, a cryptocurrency expert at investment platform Interactive Investor, says the crackdown will be a ""rude awakening"" for some.

He said: ""Those who hoped to avoid tax by simply not declaring income on the assumption that bitcoin or another crypto is anonymous are in for a rude awakening.

""It might be difficult to track down who owns which bitcoin wallet or who the sender and receiver is of a particular transaction by exploring the blockchain, but if you know the customer's wallet address and transaction history, courtesy of the exchange, then there is no anonymity whatsoever.

""And if the bitcoin price continues to appreciate, as some expect it will to as high as $40,000 next year, then tax liabilities will grow in size commensurately, to such an extent that careful tax planning should be undertaken.""

For example, Comparitech — a research firm that provides its consumers with a host of specialized data that allows one to make more informed decisions — recently used a machine learning-based analysis tool to study more than 48K Reddit posts to determine which cryptocurrencies were viewed most favorably by the masses. Not only that, the study also took into consideration a total of 7,500 crypto/blockchain-related articles from a variety of different national and international media outlets.

While over 85% of the analyzed Reddit posts were deemed to be positive in nature, articles published by various mainstream media publications such as HuffPost, Business Insider and The International Business Times were, by and large, dismissive of the crypto market.

To get a better overview of the matter, Cointelegraph has reached out to Craig Russo, owner of Peer, a Boston-based startup that is behind the popular crypto and gaming media outlet SludgeFeed. When asked about what the overall sentiment of the average social media user toward the crypto industry (at large) was like, Russo pointed out:

“While there will always be different camps or schools of thought on the crypto industry, the overall sentiment across social media continues to be bullish, both on future price growth and mainstream adoption of the technology.”

A similar point of view is also shared by Sritanshu Sinha, an independent crypto author and analyst, whose work has been shared online by the likes of John McAfee and Kim DotCom. Sinha pointed out that the overall reception that the crypto industry has received thus far on forums such as Reddit and Twitter has been quite warm. He is also quick to point out that, since the Reddit community as a whole views itself as being anti-establishment, the platform’s users are usually drawn to crypto much more than your average investor. Similarly, in the case of Twitter, he believes that there are a few independent analysts who have hundreds of thousands of followers and therefore have the power to influence the community toward fostering a positive view regarding various altcoins/digital offerings.

Has the public views on crypto changed over the years?

Another pertinent question is how the crypto industry’s general perception has evolved since the novel asset class came into the spotlight a few years back. For example, it is no secret that all through 2018, investor confidence in this space has been dwindling. However, Russo believes that Bitcoin’s (BTC) financial upswing over the last eight months has been a turning point for the industry, especially across different social media outlets. Further elaborating on his views, Russo added:

“This is in stark contrast to those invested in the altcoin markets, as many are in disbelief towards the poor performance of their assets. The regulatory environment definitely plays into the latter, as increasing pressure from the U.S. government has undoubtedly hurt investor interest in Bitcoin alternatives (i.e., Binance shutting down to U.S. customers).”

When compared to the previous years, the general sentiment toward the crypto sector has certainly become less hostile. For example, back in 2017, a time when Bitcoin was witnessing astronomical growth, the industry was still facing a lot of heat from many financial experts of differing pedigree. And while the market, at the time, was replete with countless scams (especially Twitter bots) such activities have largely died out now.

As mentioned earlier, a host of recent surveys seem to suggest that more than 80% of all crypto talk online is positive. This number seems abnormally large for an industry that is usually on the receiving end of a lot of criticism from various traditional media outlets. Sharing his thoughts on the subject, Sinha pointed out:

“80% seems about right. Mostly, because that’s the nature of evangelism. Most of us on social media seems to be crypto-evangelists. However, positive sentiments and bull markets are highly correlated and they seem to be feeding off each other to create a positive feedback loop. If I have to prophesize, the 80% positive sentiment will not be the case during a bear run. Then the voices of the skeptics will become louder and sentiments will turn increasingly negative.”

Tweet interpreters are being used to gauge global investor interest

A number of hedge funds and asset managers are currently turning to software developers to help them interpret and harness sentiment signals to their advantage. Speaking to Reuters on the subject, Bin Ren — CEO of Elwood Asset Management — was quoted as saying that this latest trend of identifying price clues from tweets and other social media messages is slowly turning into an “arms race for money managers.”

To put things into perspective, it can be seen that the costs involved with conducting such types of research analyses are quite steep. As per Andrea Leccese, president of New York-based investment firm Bluesky Capital, a simple bot-driven Twitter data exploration can cost firms anywhere between $500,000-$1 million.

Will increasing regulations stifle the industry’s growth?

Ever since Facebook announced its decision to enter the digital asset market — via its much-hyped stablecoin offering called Libra, which is backed by the Libra Foundation — the regulatory noose surrounding this space seems to have tightened considerably. However, contrary to popular belief, a number of crypto analysts seem to believe that increased regulations can be a good thing for the industry.

Cointelegraph spoke to Mohanned Halawani, the founder and CEO of Crypto PR, one of the first blockchain-specialized communication firms. He seems to be quite optimistic and believes that some of the latest regulations are actually quite advantageous for prospective investors, especially those regarding security token offerings (STOs) and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Halawani went on to add:

“The SEC has facilitated the emergence of Security Token Offerings which it felt was a more worthy investment vehicle when compared to traditional Initial Coin Offerings... Security tokens allow their investors to get information about the issuer on a fully transparent framework, providing complete visibility on all token allocations. Thanks to the regulatory benefits of these assets, authorities are beginning to their raise their standards among tradable asset classes and even support their implementation.”

Similar opinions are also provided by Joe Mercurio, project manager for Comparitech, who believes that the goal behind these regulations is to ultimately make consumers and businesses more comfortable with using cryptocurrencies on a regular basis. Mercurio shared his thoughts with Cointelegraph:

“I think that government entities will eventually adopt blockchain technology and new cryptocurrencies will begin to emerge. That said, I do believe that the market will remain volatile.”

Whether we like it or not, government regulations are crucial for any financial commodity — be it crypto or otherwise — to gain mainstream acceptance. And while these rules and guidelines may appear to hamper an asset’s growth at times, a majority of these regulations are a step in the right direction. Also, because Bitcoin and other digital currencies are basically tools for individual financial freedom, governments do not want to give up financial control over their citizens.

Simply put, when we see the history of such revolutionary technologies getting adopted by countries en masse’, we are sadly faced with a long and painful path that eventually leads to widespread human well-being.

How much of a role does social media play in shaping the public’s opinion on crypto?

Mercurio, whose core field of work includes the analysis of tweets and other online content to gauge public sentiment, is of the belief that there currently exists a strong correlation between the volume of social media posts related to a particular digital asset and its price. As part of his research, he claims to have often observed spikes in online articles when the price of a specific cryptocurrency changes. Mercurio went on to add:

“Social media posts remain more positive during times of price fluctuation compared to media coverage overall. Online enthusiasm regarding crypto has been overwhelmingly warm. We found that cryptocurrency-related subreddits were 55% more likely than media publications to have content with positive sentiment toward various cryptocurrencies.”

In a similar vein, to look at the impact that social media influencers have on the crypto industry, we can turn to a few high-profile individuals such as Elon Musk and LA Chargers’ star Russell Okung, both of whom have been advocating for the widespread adoption of crypto for quite some time now. In fact, Okung has sent out several requests to the NFL, asking the league (since the start of 2019) to provide its employees with the option of getting paid in crypto — a petition that is backed by fellow NFL star Matt Barkley.

Looking ahead

It thus appears as though the crypto market will continue to grow, mainly because people want to find newer economic avenues that are free from the involvement of any corporations or government-controlled agencies. However, a lot of this growth will depend on the use cases that emerge from this space. Also, as social media continues to play an ever-increasing role in arenas such as politics and public affairs, there is no reason to doubt its utility when it comes to crypto adoption.",

So who is investing in cryptocurrencies?

Across Europe, London has the highest concentration of cryptoholders, according to research by Global Web Index, in partnership with Bitpanda.

The study found that the level of cryptocurrency is related to:

The youth of the market The share who work in engineering, financial services or banking The proportion of people who fall into the highest income group

Compared to the average internet user in Europe, cryptocurrency holders are more likely to be:

High-income males working in European Financial centres in IT, engineering or finance

Educated to a postgraduate level

Under 35

A full-time worker or freelancer

However, this stereotype is being challenged by increasing diversity as one in five cryptocurrency holders are women, and 40 per cent are over the age of 35.

There is clearly growing demand and interest about cryptocurrency investments.

Simon Peters from cryptocurrency trading firm Etoro says: “Based on our own data, investors come from a range of backgrounds, rather than there being any one single group or investor-type.

""For us, perhaps the most interesting point about cryptoinvesting is how it’s attracted lots of younger or even first-time investors. These are people who would never have considered the idea of ‘investing’ before but have begun to learn about this world through crypto. The next task is to get them investing in other assets like stocks and bonds.""

Additionally, cryptoinvesting is also popular with family offices and institutional investors.

We are confident that in the future crypto will form part of a diversified portfolio for clients with an appropriate risk appetite across the wealth spectrum. Simon Peters

Adviser clients are also very much part of those interested in cryptocurrencies.

According to an Etoro study last year, more than three in five (63 per cent) financial advisers in the UK have been asked about cryptoassets by their clients.

Despite this, most advisers are not yet in a position to provide information or guidance to their clients in response.

Mr Peters says: “The history of investment, and development of the crypto industry, however, suggest this may not be the case in another decade’s time.

“We are confident that in the future crypto will form part of a diversified portfolio for clients with an appropriate risk appetite across the wealth spectrum.”

Richard Byworth, chief executive of cryptocurrency and blockchain firm Diginex adds: ""Once you touch cryptocurrency and start to look particularly at bitcoin and at the attributes of bitcoin the more you begin to understand this is interesting as an asset class.

""There's no question that pretty much every central bank in the world is devaluing their currency. The victims of this are people who are sat in cash of that nation state.""

This is the trigger many experts say has led to the popularity of cyptocurrencies.

Bitcoin’s current resurgence is eye-catching and it may be that we are still in the early days of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-enabled payment systems.

When scammers try to take people’s bitcoin out of their wallets on great promises of even greater fortune, some intended victims turn the scam around on the scammer.

Such is the case with Ben Perrin, the marketing director at bitcoin exchange Bull Bitcoin and a host of an educational YouTube channel about cryptocurrency, BTC Sessions, who scammed the scammer and donated the money he got to Bitcoin Venezuela. When scammers reached out to him recently with a proposal to exchange BTC for promises, Perrin utilized “a mix of photoshop, strategically finding random transactions on a block explorer, and social engineering to teach a lesson on behalf of a good cause“, as he explains in his blog post.

Unfortunately for this particular fraudster, Perrin knows how things in the dark side of the cryptoverse work. A person claiming to be a “Susan Williams” from Los Angeles told Perrin that she’s got an exclusive investment offer from a BTC mining investment platform which would do mining for the user and the daily profits would go directly into the user’s wallet, thanks to which Perrin could double his investments in just 24 hours.

Perrin pretended to be a complete novice who just cashed out some of his index funds to buy 5 “bit coin”. Susan said she’d teach him how to make a deposit and promised that he’ll earn 4 BTC by investing 2. Perrin went all in, created a fake wallet statement to send them a screenshot they asked for, and pretended to be a worried beginner who’s afraid of making a mistake and sending his money to the wrong address or “get[ing] fooled into something illegitimate”. To persuade him, Perrin suggested a test of “a small transfer to me than back to you,” and even said he’s got a similar offer from a ""Stu"" who’s “been very accommodating at putting my mind at ease” by sending him some bitcoin as a test. After more negotiation, persuasion, and patience, Perrin got the scammer to send him USD 50 worth of BTC, before calling “Susan” out, telling them about the donation and ending the conversation.

""A good rule of thumb is your investment, the amount of capital that you are allocating to something like this, should directly reflect your understanding of the asset you're investing in,"" Perrin told CBC, reminding that bitcoin transfer is irreversible. „You can't get that back unless you ask nicely and odds are if you're dealing with a scammer, they're not going to do that.""

The Indian supreme court finally heard the crypto case today after postponing it several times. The court addressed the government’s crypto policy as well as the writ petitions challenging the banking restriction by the central bank. The latter was heard in some detail while the former was further delayed at the request of the government.

Supreme Court Heard RBI Ban Case Today

The Supreme Court of India addressed two crypto-related issues Thursday after repeatedly postponing hearing them. The first issue concerns the banking restriction by the central bank. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular in April last year banning regulated financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses.

According to Crypto Kanoon, an Indian platform for crypto regulatory news and analysis, the provisions of the RBI Act and the Banking Regulation Act, along with the circular in question, were all analyzed in court to ascertain whether the central bank has the power to impose such a ban. The “RBI is only a delegatee of power which cannot exercise [the] same powers as Parliament which has a direct impact on legitimate businesses,” the platform conveyed.

The counsel for crypto exchanges argued that the “RBI restricting banks from providing services to crypto [businesses] is a colorable exercise in the guise of consumer interest. It can exercise power in public interest only to the extent as provided under law such as interest of depositors, borrowers etc,” Crypto Kanoon detailed. The counsel showed the court that crypto exchanges have suffered losses due to the banking ban including a decrease in the number of users. The court further asked about companies and businesses that were shut down due to the banking restriction. “Why can’t you work without [a] bank?” the court continued to ask. The counsel explained that “Any settlement taking place will be converted into cash,” the platform conveyed, elaborating:

Technology underlying the blockchain and crypto is being explained to the Hon’ble judges … Manner in which other countries have treated cryptos has been discussed.

In addition, the counsel argued that cryptocurrency “must not be equated to sovereign currency i.e., rupee etc,” emphasizing that the former is a commodity while the latter a currency. Crypto Kanoon added that Thursday’s hearing ended with the court setting a follow-up date to resume hearing the case on Aug. 14.

Government’s Crypto Policy Hearing Delayed

The second issue the supreme court addressed Thursday relates to the government’s policy on cryptocurrency. Crypto Kanoon reported that the Indian government “submitted [a] draft regulation before the court which was submitted to it by [the] Garg committee,” adding:

Govt. requested the court to adjourn the matter till January as it intends to introduce the bill in Parliament in [the] winter session.

The Garg committee is the interministerial committee (IMC) constituted on Nov. 2, 2017, under the chairmanship of former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Subhash Chandra Garg, to study all aspects of cryptocurrency and provide recommendations. It has representation from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and Central Board of Direct Taxes.

Year-Long Efforts to End RBI Ban

Soon after the RBI issued the aforementioned circular, a number of industry stakeholders filed writ petitions challenging the banking restriction. The ban went into effect in July last year and banks subsequently closed accounts of crypto exchanges. The Indian supreme court was scheduled to hear all crypto-related petitions in September last year, but the case was repeatedly postponed.

The lack of banking access has caused a number of crypto businesses to shut down, including at least four crypto exchanges. Zebpay, formerly one of the largest crypto exchanges in India, closed down its local exchange operations in September last year. Earlier this year, Coindelta announced its shutdown, followed by Coinome, Koinex, and Cryptokart. Gaurang Poddar, founder of Cryptokart, explained that since the RBI ban took effect, “The general interest in crypto in India has tanked. Also since the government isn’t going to introduce any regulations and leave it grey for a while, it just makes any long term planning difficult.”

Regulatory Uncertainty

The Indian government is currently deliberating on the country’s crypto policy. The IMC report submitted to the finance ministry was made public on July 22. The report, however, is dated Feb. 28. It contains the committee’s recommendations regarding crypto assets as well as a draft bill entitled Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019.

Garg tweeted after the report was made public that his “Committee is very receptive and supportive of distributed ledger technologies … [but] Private cryptocurrencies are of no real value. Rightly banned.” Noting “extreme fluctuations” in prices of cryptocurrencies, the committee believes that “private cryptocurrencies should not be allowed,” stating:

The committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalizing carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India.

Soon after the report was published, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reshuffled his top-level bureaucrats and removed Garg from the DEA Secretary position, shifting him to the Power Ministry. Garg is reportedly unhappy with this shift and subsequently applied for voluntary retirement.

The Ministry of Finance revealed on July 22 that the IMC report is being examined “in consultation with all the concerned departments and regulatory authorities before the government takes a final decision.” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has seen the presentation by the committee but she recently admitted that she had not looked at the report and bill in detail. “They have gone much ahead of all other countries that have thought about it. It’s a very futuristic and well-thought-out report. I have not spent time on it after the presentation,” she told the Economic Times in an interview.

Meanwhile, the Indian crypto community has ramped up efforts to engage lawmakers to show them how flawed the IMC report is in hopes that the government will not go ahead with the draft bill to ban cryptocurrencies.

Crypto Not Prohibited, Tax Laws Applicable

While the government is deliberating on the country’s crypto policy, the tax department has been sending a long list of probing questions to cryptocurrency owners. Anoush Bhasin, founder of Quagmire Consulting which specializes in crypto tax solutions, explained to news.Bitcoin.com Tuesday that “Not complying with the notice or furnishing incomplete / inaccurate information may lead to the taxman conducting a Search & Seizure operation.”

He emphasized: “Tax laws in India are applicable irrespective of the legal status of income … Even if a ban is introduced, taxes would continue to apply to crypto income and it would not stop the taxman from chasing unaccounted or untaxed income earned from dealing in crypto assets.”

In the meantime, cryptocurrency is currently not prohibited in India, Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Singh Thakur has confirmed.

Bitcoin is looking north, with the daily chart reporting a bearish channel breakout following a six-week-long correction. A retest of highs above $13,000 could be in the offing.

The bullish case would strengthen if prices rise above $12,145, invalidating consolidation or exhaustion signaled by Wednesday’s candlestick pattern. A stronger confirmation of a bull revival would be a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.

A break below Wednesday’s low of $11,388 would weaken the bullish case. That level could come into play in the next 24 hours if the symmetrical triangle seen on the hourly chart is breached to the downside.

The bitcoin (BTC) market appears to have ended its six-week-long correction on Wednesday, making way for a retest of key resistance at $13,200.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value closed just above $11,940 on Bitstamp yesterday, confirming an upside break of the falling channel represented by trendlines connecting June 26 and July 10 highs and July 2 and July 17 lows.

Put simply, Wednesday’s UTC close confirmed an end of the pullback from the June 26 high of $13,880 and a revival of the bull market.

Hence, the doors look open for a rise to $13,200 – a bearish lower high created on July 10.

So far, however, BTC has not been able to capitalize on the bull breakout. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $11,850 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $12,031 earlier today.

Traders may want to see BTC settle above $12,000 before hitting the market with fresh bids. After all, the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to hold onto gains above $12,000 in the last six weeks, as discussed yesterday.

Daily chart

The bearish channel breakout indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side.

The breakout would gain credence if prices clear Wednesday’s high of $12,145. That would invalidate exhaustion or mark an upside break of consolidation represented by yesterday’s inside bar pattern.

An inside bar occurs when the high and low of a candlestick falls within the preceding day’s price action. Essentially, it represents consolidation after a big move (or bull exhaustion).

The bullish case put forward by the channel breakout would be invalidated if BTC prints a UTC close below the inside bar’s low of $11,388. That would confirm a bearish inside bar reversal and allow a deeper drop toward $10,000.

Crypto trader and analyst Josh Rager argued on Twitter “it’s far riskier being bearish at this point in time,” suggesting only a break below $11,000 would shift risk in favor of a drop to $9,000.

Hourly chart

BTC has carved out a symmetrical triangle (narrowing price range) on the hourly chart.

A move above the upper edge of the symmetrical triangle, currently at $12,000, would imply a continuation of the rally from lows near $9,100 seen on July 28.

Symmetrical triangle breakdown, if confirmed with a move below $11,693, would expose support at $11,388 (the inside bar’s low).

On July 25, North Carolina’s Rep. Ted Budd (R) on July 25 reintroduced the bill, titled the “Virtual Value Tax Fix Act of 2019.” By amending1986’s Internal Revenue Code, the bill, if passed, would essentially end the double taxation on cryptocurrency transactions.

According to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, no gain or loss is recognized on the exchange of real property for real property of like kind. The tax bill seeks to bring the same treatment to virtual currencies.

“[T]he exchange of virtual currency for virtual currency of like kind shall be treated in the same manner as the exchange of real property for real property of like kind,” the bill states.

In his previous comments, Rep. Budd had explained that due to the lack of like-kind exchange, the cryptocurrency industry is subject to double taxation of cryptocurrency transactions.

“An effective sales tax of nearly 40% penalizes the use of digital units of commerce,” he said. “The use of digital assets is already treated as a sale of the asset, even though the economic reality of the transaction is a purchase of a simple consumer good.”

Last month, Rep. Tom Emmer (MN-R) reintroduced the “Safe Harbor for Tax Payers with Forked Assets Act of 2019.” He said that the bill will bring more clarity on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies following hard forks and airdrops.

TokenPost | [email protected]",,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/456583-congress-takes-an-interest-in-cryptocurrency-what-could-possibly-go-wrong,"Congress recently wrapped up long-awaited hearings about the future of cryptocurrency in America and around the world. Driven primarily by Facebook’s announcement of its Libra project, lawmakers in both the House and Senate heard testimony regarding the potential for federal regulation of digital payment systems. Although the sometimes contentious hearings were preliminary, and few if any conclusions were drawn, one thing is certain — the days of cryptocurrency flying under the radar are over and Congress is sure to continue to investigate its role in oversight into the burgeoning technology.

For most Americans, terms such as Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain are mysterious concepts. But over the past 10 years since Bitcoin’s creation in 2009, the worldwide market has grown exponentially, with hundreds of crypto assets currently trading in public markets. Bitcoin is the most prominent of these assets, but its growth has been more akin to a roller coaster ride than a moon shot. The price has fluctuated wildly, sometimes varying by thousands of dollars over a few days, and Bitcoin has been declared dead by analysts on more than one occasion.

President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump alludes to possible 2024 run in White House remarks Trump threatens to veto defense bill over tech liability shield Tiger King's attorney believes they're close to getting pardon from Trump MORE certainly didn’t help Bitcoin’s cause when he tweeted on July 11 that he is “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not real money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin piled on, expressing concern about the potential for cryptocurrency to be used for nefarious activities, ranging from money laundering to financial transactions between terrorist organizations. Last month’s congressional hearings raised similar concerns, although many committee members instead focused their attention on an even bigger target — Facebook.

The social media behemoth has been in the crosshairs of international regulators and Congress since 2016, with major concerns about data privacy first among the long list of grievances. It is therefore no wonder that Congress and financial experts quickly jumped aboard the anti-Libra bandwagon when Facebook in June announced its plan to create its own cryptocurrency. Although many conflate the issues surrounding Libra and Bitcoin, the two actually are quite different.

While both Libra and Bitcoin operate on a secure blockchain ledger technology, Bitcoin transactions are anonymous and designed specifically to allow individuals to engage in peer-to-peer transactions free from banks, regulatory scrutiny and red tape. Libra, on the other hand, has partnered with corporate heavyweights such as Visa, PayPal and Uber to create a permission-based currency which will conduct business only with trusted parties. In many ways, this is the exact opposite of what the anti-establishment Bitcoin founders had in mind, as Facebook’s Libra will be governed by a centralized consortium of large institutions who have invested millions in the project.

To avoid the tumultuous market swings Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have experienced, Libra is designed to be used mostly for money transfers and international payments. The key distinction is that Bitcoin offers a fixed supply of 21 million coins, while Facebook will have the ability to adjust the supply of Libras to react to demand changes in the market. This emphasis on maintaining a stable value has led to Libra’s preferred terminology of “stablecoin.” This all sounds good, but it is safe to say Congress isn’t buying it.

With the misgivings many members of Congress have about Facebook’s sometimes ham-handed efforts to defend its data security policies, it comes as no surprise that some committee members used their time to lambaste the company, expressing skepticism that Facebook would use the technology in consumers’ best interest. Some of this likely was political grandstanding, and it was clear that some members of the committees didn’t fully grasp the intricacies of the issue.

Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that this is just the beginning of what promises to be a lengthy process of political oversight into what has been, up to this point, a relatively under-scrutinized issue. The combination of a corporate adversary, an issue with the potential to impact the pocketbook of every American, President Trump’s Twitter attention, and the bright lights of fawning media coverage surely will prove too much of a temptation for politicians to ignore.

In exploring the details of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, Congress is bringing important issues to public attention. These issues are certain to grow outside the financial services industry. For example, West Virginia recently became the first state to utilize blockchain technology for absentee voting, allowing military personnel serving overseas to cast their ballots via smartphone. Predictably, there were a few glitches and some after-the-fact concerns were raised. Nevertheless, these types of experiments represent a new frontier as innovators explore new uses for the blockchain technology.

Although a little late to the party, Congress is asking the right questions and finally paying attention. If these efforts are to benefit the American people, politicians in Washington must use this opportunity to fairly investigate the multitude of issues surrounding this new technology, and most importantly, to avoid the temptation to turn the proceedings into a circus. To do otherwise will only add further uncertainty to an already complicated issue.

Those woes could deepen as recent reports have revealed that a very small number of people control a very large amount of USDT.

Crypto Whales or Crypto Mafia?

It has been well reported that Bitcoin whales collectively own a fifth of the world’s largest digital asset but new findings are revealing that Tether holdings may be even more concentrated. A recent Bloomberg report citing research by Coin Metrics claims that just over 300 crypto addresses own over 80% of the USDT supply.

Tether has been embroiled in controversy since its launch four years ago yet the printers keep rolling more off the digital presses. Many top crypto exchanges have likened the coin and its few heavy bag holders to a digital mafia. Finance professor at University of Texas, John Griffin, told Bloomberg;

“The concentration of Tether suggests that control of Tether is in the hands of a few central players who can swing Bitcoin prices, and have a vested interest in doing so. It also suggests that many exchange players have a vested interest in keeping the Tether game going.”

According to Massachusetts based analytics firm, Coin Metrics, just 318 addresses that hold $1 million or more of Tether. Research only included tokens on the OMNI and Ethereum blockchains. At an estimated 80% of the total supply this equates to around $3.2 billion in USDT.

This concentrated ownership of Tether raises the risk of market manipulation for Bitcoin prices since a large number of transactions are now conducted in USDT. According to Coinmarketcap.com around 46% of its total volume in BTC transactions is made with Tether.

Some of the largest exchanges on the planet are among the top holders of Tether. Binance and Bitfinex, which issues USDT tokens have huge stashes of it which can be used to manipulate markets if desired. Chinese investors needing to exchange Yuan are also on the Tether whale list since trade has increased there over the past year or so.

Co-founder of market tracker TokenAnalyst, Sid Shekhar, commented;

“The extremely centralized holdings bring about extreme volatility when large swathes of Tether are released in the market,”

This represents the fourth emergency action taken against a cryptocurrency firm since the Enforcement Division of the State Securities Board restarted a sweeping investigation of the industry in June.

According to a statement published August 7, the New York-based Forex and Bitcoin Trader advertised 900 percent gains for two week investments. The firm stated a $2,000 investment in cryptocurrencies, foreign currencies, or commodity-based derivatives would see returns of $20,000, not including fees, through their guidance.

The firm also claimed to be a licensed broker-dealer with an insurance policy and sufficient capital to guarantee returns.

Investigators found the company is not registered as either a dealer or agent with the state’s Securities Commissioner. Additionally, the firm had not supplied information regarding its purported insurance policy.

The Securities Board first launched a regulatory sweep of the crypto industry amid the market exuberance of late 2017. Though the pace of emergency actions slowed in the following year, the watchdog has found “the number of suspect cryptocurrency offerings being promoted to Texas investors increase along with the run-up in the price of cryptocurrencies and volatility in the cryptocurrency markets.”

To date, the agency has filed 24 administrative orders involving 62 individuals and entities, including an Australia-based cloud mining firm, a faux crypto exchange, and a crypto promoter who duped investors with falsified endorsements from the likes of Jennifer Anniston, Prince Charles, and former Finland prime minister Matti Vanhanen.

According to a report published August 5 from Alston and Bird, an international law firm, any business that accepts fees for currency transmissions, or maintains control over virtual currencies for others will fall under the new law beginning January 1, 2020.

Part of Rhode Island’s licensure for crypto firms are strict compliance metrics, anti-money laundering and anti-fraud protocols, and security requirements. Firms must also demonstrate an operational ability to “protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of any non-public personal information or currency transmission it receives, maintains, or transmits.”

Many of these requirements are adaptations from the standing money transmission legislation in the state. What’s new is a firm must maintain holdings of cryptocurrencies in kind and quantity equal to amount being transmitter by clients.

In the bill, cryptocurrencies are defined as “a digital representation of value that is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account, or store of value, and is not legal tender, whether or not denominated in legal tender.”

Outside the purview of the law are digital currencies that are not exchangeable for fiat, or that exist solely on a gaming or blockchain platform. This stands in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent decision that enables an ERC-20 token to be legally sold on a gaming startup’s blockchain.

Additional licensing exemptions exist for “personal, family, or household” uses of virtual currencies, academic purposes, and certain escrow services, among others.

The Indian government has submitted a draft crypto bill to the supreme court and expressed its intention to introduce the bill in the next parliament session. The court subsequently set a new date to hear the case relating to crypto regulation. Meanwhile, the Indian crypto community has ramped up efforts to influence the government’s final decision on the country’s crypto policy.

Government Unveils Plan for Crypto Bill

The Indian government has been deliberating on the crypto report submitted by an interministerial committee (IMC) tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrencies and providing recommendations. The report containing a draft crypto bill was made public on July 22 but the bill has yet to be introduced in parliament.

During Thursday’s supreme court hearing of the crypto case, the government unveiled its plan regarding the bill. Financial Express publication reported that the government informed the court that the IMC has recommended a “complete ban on private cryptocurrencies” in India, adding:

The Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, will be introduced in parliament in the next session.

An Indian platform for crypto regulatory news and analysis, Crypto Kanoon, reported that the government requested the court to adjourn the crypto case until “January as it intends to introduce the bill in parliament in [the] winter session.” Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, has three sessions. The winter session takes place in November and December.

While the Indian government intends to introduce this bill, Nischal Shetty, CEO of local exchange Wazirx, emphasized that it is not set in stone as the crypto community in India is working tirelessly to convince the government that the bill is flawed. “I’m sure such a rough draft bill which does not even classify crypto properly will not be presented in parliament,” he opined.

Even though the supreme court postponed hearing the petitions relating to India’s crypto regulation, it heard the writ petitions against the banking restriction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in some detail on Thursday. News.Bitcoin.com previously reported on the RBI hearing which will resume on Aug. 14. As for the petitions concerning the crypto regulation, the court is expected to hear the case in January next year.

Bill Seeks to Ban Crypto

Constituted on Nov. 2, 2017, under the chairmanship of former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg, the IMC has representation from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and Central Board of Direct Taxes.

The committee met three times before submitting its crypto report and draft bill to the Ministry of Finance. The report itself is dated Feb. 28. “The committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalizing carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India,” the report reads. Among other prohibitions, the bill states that “No person shall mine, generate, hold, sell, deal in, issue, transfer, dispose of or use cryptocurrency in the territory of India.” News.Bitcoin.com previously reported on the content of this bill.

The finance ministry has confirmed that the report is being examined by relevant regulators. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently admitted that she had not spent time on the report but saw a presentation on it and thought that it was a “very futuristic and well-thought-out report.”

Flawed Report, Community’s Efforts to Inform Government

Since the public release of the IMC report, the Indian crypto community has ramped up efforts to help the government see how flawed the report is, pointing out many areas that indicate the lack of understanding of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology on the IMC part.

Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of local crypto exchange Unocoin, told news.Bitcoin.com that, to his knowledge, there was never any invitation from the government to industry stakeholders to discuss the drafting of this bill. “In the draft bill, there are many major flaws,” he expressed. “They have a wrong understanding of the technology and usage of crypto assets.”

Shetty has been running a social media campaign called “India Wants Crypto” which has entered its 282nd day.

“We’re doing everything we can on our end to ensure that the government involves the stakeholders,” he shared with news.Bitcoin.com Friday. “I’m confident the government will set up a standing committee first (even the IMC report recommends that). If the standing committee is set up, we’ll see deeper industry participation and this will lead to a more comprehensive and well-planned crypto regulation in India.”

Elaborating that “Behind the scenes, we’re meeting elected representatives from all over the country,” he added:

We want to ensure that our leaders hear our point of view since this whole ban narrative has been created due to a misunderstanding that crypto is here to replace INR. Crypto is more an asset and utility and that’s the biggest use case currently prevalent in India.

Sumit Gupta, CEO of local crypto exchange Coindcx, also shared some thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com Friday. “We are hopeful that the government will consider the case presented by the crypto community and will make an informed decision that is in the best interest for the country,” he believes. “The Indian crypto community is actively working on sharing across our points to government officials for informed decision making.”

Further, many think that the Indian government should take into account more recent crypto developments since the report was drafted such as the crypto guidance by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the G20 meetings where India and the finance minister independently declared their commitments to applying the FATF standards.

Crypto 101 Kit Sent to Finance Minister

Sohail Merchant, CEO of local crypto exchange Pocketbits, announced on Aug. 3 that he had sent a letter to the finance minister along with a “crypto 101 kit” on behalf of the crypto community in India. “The negative public perception of crypto needs to be changed with facts,” he tweeted.

In his letter, Merchant pointed out that the IMC’s ban recommendations “are based on the premise that cryptocurrencies lack the characteristics of currency hence cannot be legal tender” and that “their usage for payments could compete with the use of INR, which could lead to less control over monetary policy.” However, Merchant argued that “the community has not requested crypto assets to be regulated as legal tender or currency,” reiterating:

Our request to be considered is that crypto assets can be classified as a commodity or an asset; it is a store of value. As Indian citizens, we want to exercise our right to trade and commerce, which was granted to use by The Constitution of India.

Banning Not a Solution

The Indian crypto community has been trying to convince the government that banning cryptocurrencies is not a solution. “If the ban comes into effect, the black market will continue to thrive. It will be the common man, compliant businesses, and innovators building upon these protocols that will be affected,” Merchant wrote in his letter to the finance minister. “If a standing committee is constituted to deliberate on regulating crypto assets, we as an industry are willing to work along and help draft a framework,” he offered.

His letter echoes a statement issued on July 31 by The Indian National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) regarding the banning of crypto assets. Nasscom is a non-profit information technology industry association self-described as “the apex body for the 154 billion dollar IT BPM industry in India.” Among its initiatives, the group “Liaisons with government and industry to influence a favourable policy framework,” its website states.

The association said it believes the recent IMC proposal “to ban all cryptocurrencies, barring those that are backed by the government, is not the most constructive measure. Instead, the government should work towards developing a risk-based framework to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens.” This suggestion is in line with the guidance for a risk-based approach to crypto assets and service providers issued by the FATF for in June.

Emphasizing that “A ban would inhibit new applications and solutions from being deployed and would discourage tech startups” and “would handicap India from participating in new use cases that cryptocurrencies nad tokens offer,” Nasscom reiterated that “A ban is more likely to deter only the legitimate operators as they have no intent to be non-compliant.”

Endorsing her association’s stance, Nasscom President Debjani Ghosh tweeted Friday:

We cannot close the door on new technologies. We need to learn, experiment and create the right regulatory frameworks to get the best out of these technologies. Banning is not the answer.

Experts call the United States-China trade war a key reason for the main cryptocurrency’s price fluctuations. Fuel to the fire has been added by the recent announcement by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) of plans to get ahead of the U.S. and Facebook’s Libra by issuing a national cryptocurrency.

Chinese government is set to digitize yuan, challenge U.S. and Libra

As Cointelegraph reported, the PBoC plans to focus on developing its own legal digital currency. On Aug. 2, during a video conference devoted to discussing financial tasks for the second half of 2019, heads of financial and economic institutes in China touched upon the topic of cryptocurrencies. The country’s central bank announced its intention to accelerate the development of its own digital currency and also confirmed its plans to allocate more resources to the implementation of this task.

It is notable that the decision of the Chinese bank to intensify the creation of a national cryptocurrency was preceded by the hotly debated development of the Libra coin. Initiated by Facebook in 2019, the project is now actively being lobbied for in the U.S. government, but without any results so far.

Related: US Congress on Libra Overview: Trust, Privacy and Genocide Accusations

In July, Wang Xin, director of the PBoC Research Bureau, said that, with the development of the Libra cryptocurrency project, the People’s Bank of China should accelerate the growth of its own digital currency, which it has been working on over the past few years. Wang believes that the risks Libra bears for the traditional financial system will force regulators to devote many more resources and forces to develop its digital currency. Wang asked:

“If [Libra] is widely used for payments — cross-border payments in particular — would it be able to function like money and accordingly have a large influence on monetary policy, financial stability, and the international monetary system?”

In particular, China is concerned about which currencies Libra will be tied to and what role the U.S. dollar will play in this project. Wang said:

“If the digital currency is closely associated with the US dollar, it could create a scenario under which sovereign currencies would coexist with US dollar-centric digital currencies. But there would be in essence one boss, that is the US dollar and the United States. If so, it would bring a series of economic, financial and even international political consequences.”

Former PBoC Chairman Zhou Xiaochuan also believes that the concept of a global digital currency introduced by Facebook that can be exchanged into fiat money threatens existing cross-border payment systems and could weaken the position of national currencies, which he spoke about at a conference in Beijing, as reported by the South China Morning Post.

According to Zhou, Chinese authorities need to strengthen the national currency and consider the Hong Kong model to create a digital renminbi, which involves issuing money through commercial enterprises under the supervision of the central bank. Some analysts have already expressed the belief that technology giants Alibaba and Tencent may be assigned such a task. Large corporations in the country appear to be supportive of the ideas coming from government ​​members, as Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei commented:

“China can just issue our own version of Libra. Why should we wait for others to do it? The power of a country is always stronger than that of an Internet company.”

Stablecoin to support the local economy

A future national cryptocurrency may be issued in the form of a stablecoin tied to the yuan (also called the renminbi). Researchers at the PBoC published a review of recent initiatives in this area back in October last year. Most of the coins discussed in the material are pegged to the U.S. dollar, such as Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard (PAX). The researchers are convinced that the development of cryptocurrencies tied to USD strengthens the role of the dollar in the global monetary system, while also having a negative impact on other fiat currencies. According to the researchers:

“If the stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar end up being widely recognized by the market and prove their applicability in the real economy, we will have to redouble our research efforts in this direction, as well as in studying the relevant experience. This is necessary to support local institutions and issue stablecoins tied to the renminbi.”

At the same time, the authors note that stablecoins still have a long way to go before the financial system begins to feel any significant influence from new assets. Star Xu, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin, expressed a similar point of view in his post on Weibo, writing: “The dollar-pegged #stablecoin regulated by the US government will strengthen the penetration of the US dollar 100 fold.”

Bitcoin is growing due to the yuan’s rate falling

Analysts have drawn parallels between the declining rate of the yuan and Bitcoin’s growth. The price of the preeminent digital currency rose sharply the very moment when the Chinese currency fell by 7% to an 11-year low. On Aug. 5, Bitcoin’s price surged to $11,786, with the daily increase amounting to an 11% gain.

U.S. President Donald Trump alleged on Twitter that the Chinese government is manipulating the price of the renminbi:

“China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called ‘currency manipulation.’ Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!”

As financial analysts suggest, the renminbi declined due to investors' concerns about a new round of escalation in the trade war between China and the U.S. This happened a few days after Trump introduced additional tariffs on goods imported from China. Now that U.S. products could become more expensive for Chinese consumers, a lower exchange rate might adversely affect U.S. exporters. The prices of U.S. stock futures have already declined, while the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated the opposite tendency.

Some analysts have postulated that the reason for this dynamic could be because Chinese investors use Bitcoin as a means of saving money. Simon Peters, an analyst at trading platform eToro, suggested that Chinese investors could want to diversify as the yuan fell. According to Peters:

“Given that Chinese investors make up a large proportion of crypto investors, there’s a strong possibility some are backing bitcoin’s chances against the yuan.”

However, Peter Schiff, an economist and CEO of brokerage company Euro Pacific Capital, rejected this explanation, claiming it was more about speculation rather than about real need:

“CNBC is trying its best to dupe its audience into buying Bitcoin. Despite gold being a much larger market, CNBC devotes far more airtime to Bitcoin. The Chinese aren't buying Bitcoin as a safe haven. Speculators are buying, betting that the Chinese will buy it as a safe haven!”

The internet says...

An ambiguous statement made by the PBoC regarding the creation of a national cryptocurrency has sparked intense discussion around the world. Several points of view, primarily negative, have appeared on the internet in response. Some users suggested that both the U.S. and China need cryptocurrency to strengthen control over their citizens. Crypto enthusiast Richard Heart opined:

“Nations want more control over their cirizens. Nothing new...or good.”

And some even suggested that the confrontation between China and the U.S. in the cryptocurrency field could lead to a world war.

Place your bets

How soon Chinese residents will be able to see — and most importantly use — the local digital cryptocurrency is still unknown, as it may take years to implement such an idea. The full process may require the development of a regulatory framework, instruments of taxation and regulation, as well as creating special entities and hiring specialists who will work with cryptocurrency.

Previously, attempts to create a national cryptocurrency have already been undertaken by countries such as Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Estonia and Venezuela. The South American country allegedly raised $1 billion during the presale of the supposedly oil-backed cryptocurrency Petro, and Venezuelan banks began to display the citizens' account balance in the new currency. This year, Venezuela intends to make Petro OPEC’s main digital currency, according to Oil Minister Manuel Quevedo.

In regard to China, such an initiative has been discussed since January of 2016, when representatives of the PBoC announced the plans outlining their desire to create the country’s own digital currency as soon as possible. At the same time, the Chinese central bank also clearly articulated the advantages of cryptocurrencies over traditional money:

“Digital currencies are much cheaper in circulation than traditional fiat money, promote trade, increase transaction transparency and reduce the risks of money laundering and tax evasion. The use of digital currency will help build a new financial infrastructure, strengthen the payment system in China, increase the efficiency of mutual settlements and accelerate the modernization of the economy.”

Notably, the PBoC has been following the development of the digital currency market for a long time, with an appropriate research group created back in 2014. And since 2015, the Chinese government has been actively studying the regulatory experience of other countries in order to prepare an appropriate regulatory framework.

It is noteworthy that in a report published on the PBoC’s official website, the word “Bitcoin” is not mentioned even once, although China is one of the top players in the crypto industry. The principles and technologies on the basis of which it is planned to create a state digital currency are also not explained.

At the same time, blockchain technology is mentioned only once as one of the iconic phenomena in the information technology development. However, the general context of the statements suggests that the future digital currency will have much in common with Bitcoin — at least, from a technical point of view.

Wang noted that the PBoC was one of the first central banks to start exploring the possibility of creating its own digital currency, but research experience alone is not enough. Wang said, “We had an early start [...] but lots of work is needed to consolidate our lead.” He also confirmed that the central bank has already received approval from Chinese authorities to create its own digital currency, though it is not yet known at which stage its development is currently at. Huang Yiping, a Beijing University professor and the chairman of the research initiative, said that China is ahead of the U.S. in promoting digital finance. He continued:

“It remains unclear if Libra will succeed [...] but the concept won’t disappear. But it has sent a warning to China that its lead [in digital finance] is not a sure thing.”

However, in an interview with Cointelegraph, one of the senior PBoC representatives — who wished to remain anonymous — said that the implementation of such a fundamental project may not do without risks, continuing:",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/expert-india-will-lose-an-almost-13-billion-market-by-banning-crypto,"Sidharth Sogani, the CEO of crypto and blockchain research firm Crebaco Global Inc, believes that India will lose around $12.9 billion worth of market if cryptocurrency is banned in the country.

Sogani shared his reasoning with the news outlet AMBCrypto, which reported the matter on Aug. 8. According to the report, Crebaco’s methodology included an analysis of how much revenue companies might have generated if crypto was ruled to be legal, as well as crypto companies with Indian founders who moved offshore due to the Reserve Bank of India’s banking ban.

As per the report, Crebaco came up with the following figures as part of its total estimated revenue from crypto in India: $4.9 billion as indicated by crypto white papers and associated business plans; $2.1 billion from expert blockchain coders; $1.27 billion from content creators; and $4.5 billion from miscellaneous jobs, including lawyers, event managers and laborers.

Sogani further believes that India will ultimately be forced to regulate cryptocurrencies instead of banning them wholesale, as it is unlikely that India could enforce such a ban:

“They will have to regulate it, because if they don’t, it will raise a question as how they will implement a ban on a population of 130 Crore people [...] They dont seem to have the mechanics of doing that, given India is country of 1.3 billion people.”

Government panel’s proposed ban

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a governmental panel in India officially recommended that the country ban cryptocurrencies on July 22. The panel further recommended imposing sanctions on any crypto-related dealings. However, regulators and the government have yet to finish reviewing the report and draft legislation, which will need to happen before the government passes a verdict.

According to Sogani, he presented information about cryptocurrency usage to the panel, and was surprised when they moved to go through with a ban recommendation anyway:",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/35406/binance-shares-details-on-tokens-under-consideration-for-us-launch,,2019-08-09 16:15:59+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-in-tug-of-war-between-bulls-and-bears-as-trading-range-tightens,"View

Bitcoin has charted a narrowing price range over the last three days, neutralizing the immediate bullish setup.

A bull revival needs a UTC close above Wednesday’s high of $12,145, according to a double inside bar pattern seen on the daily chart.

The outlook would turn bearish if prices print a UTC close below Wednesday’s low of $11,388.

The odds of a bearish UTC close would rise if BTC breaks lower from the contracting triangle seen on the intraday charts.

Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing indecisive price action for the third day, with a break above Wednesday’s high of $12,145 needed to revive the bullish outlook.

The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading at $11,690 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.85 percent drop on the day.

Prices hit a high of $12,040 in the Asian trading hours before quickly falling back below the $12,000 mark. Today is the fourth straight day of bull failure above $12,000.

The cryptocurrency hit an intraday high of $12,325, $12,145 and $12,061 on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, respectively only to print a UTC close below $12,000 on all three days.

Essentially, BTC has charted lower highs above $12,000 since Tuesday. At the same time, it has created higher lows in the last three days. That narrowing price range is a sign of indecision in the market place.

The consolidation could also be considered a sign of bullish exhaustion since it comes following a 35 percent price rise over eight days, as seen in the chart below.

6-hour chart

Bitcoin picked up a bid near $9,100 and rose to a one-month high of $12,325 on Tuesday. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been restricted to a contracting price range, as represented by trendlines connecting lower highs and higher lows.

A break above $12,000 would confirm range breakout and pave way for a move toward $13,000.

BTC, however, could fall back to the former resistance-turned-support of $11,120 if the range is breached to the downside.

The relative strength index is reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern. As a result, a range breakdown looks likely.

Daily chart

Bitcoin revived the bull market with a falling channel breakout on Wednesday. So far, however, the follow-through has been anything but bullish.

The cryptocurrency created a dragonfly doji yesterday, which occurs when the market trades down and then reverses to close largely unchanged on the day.

That candlestick pattern is widely considered an early warning of bearish reversal.

The daily chart also shows a “double inside bar pattern” – yesterday’s doji falls within Wednesday’s high and low and Wednesday’s candle is engulfed by Tuesday’s high and low.

Double inside bars indicate consolidation and lack of volatility. Trading volumes have also dropped over the last two days.

The pattern often paves the way for an explosive move on either side. A break above the high of the first inside bar is considered a sign of bullish breakout and a move below the low of the first inside bar’s low is taken as a bearish reversal signal.

So, the focus is on Wednesday’s high and low of $12,145 and $11,388.

A UTC close above $12,145 would signal a resumption of the rally from recent lows near $9,100 and open the doors to the bearish lower high of $13,200 created on July 10.

A UTC close below $11,388 would confirm the bearish reversal and shift risk in favor of a drop to $9,057 (July 17 low).

Quontic Bank opened a checking account for a bitcoin ATM company a few weeks ago and is in the process of completing a contract to deliver banking services to another crypto startup. The bank wouldn’t name either client.

“We’re just taking steps so that when the regulatory environment becomes more crypto-friendly, we don’t have a lot of catching up to do,” said Quontic chief executive Steven Schnall, who acquired the bank in 2009. “We’re looking to diversify our product offering and our customer mix by entering into that field.”

While Schnall wouldn’t say how big he wants Quontic’s crypto business to be, he claimed the pending contract “could impact millions of Americans.”

Crypto-friendly banks are extremely rare, in part because of the extra work they have to do complying with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations.

“Banks and other financial institutions have to look out for any suspicious activity,” said Joshua Klayman, head of the blockchain and digital assets practice at law firm Linklaters. “If you have a startup that raised money doing an ICO and didn’t do proper KYC or AML, that bank doesn’t know who the proceeds are from.”

The handful of U.S. banks willing to serve the sector includes Silvergate in California and Signature and Metropolitan Commercial in New York.

Like those institutions, Quontic is a relative pipsqueak in the banking industry. With $420 million in assets, it is only 0.015 percent the size of JPMorgan.

Yet Quontic stands out because its leaders caught the crypto bug early on.

Students of crypto

Schnall, a longtime mortgage lender, became interested in bitcoin when it was worth less than $1, bought his first bitcoin at $75 in 2013 and lost 500 BTC in the Mt Gox debacle.

Patrick Sells, now the bank’s chief innovation officer, said Schnall began to educate him on bitcoin the first few times they met, while Sells was doing mortgage lead generation for Quontic through his own firm.

To learn more about the mechanics of cryptocurrency, Schnall and Sells built an ethereum mining operation, independent from Quontic, in January 2018. (Schnall said he is now more bullish on bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency.)

The two executives even came close to launching their own cryptocurrency, also separate from the bank, called QCoin. They lined up $2.5 million for an initial coin offering (ICO) but called it off after the market crashed.

Undeterred by the ups and downs, the bankers said that they believe banking and crypto can have a symbiotic relationship and are exploring what steps toward that goal might look like under the U.S. regulatory framework.

The bankers helped educate their staff of 180 by giving them each $20 in bitcoin when the price of bitcoin was around $3,000, and they’re looking to hire employees with experience in cryptocurrency.

“We can teach them the banking side,” said Sells, vaping in a white v-neck and jeans at Quontic’s Manhattan headquarters. “It’s easier to do that than vice versa.”

Highly selective

While the bank wants to let cryptocurrency companies know that it’s open to banking them, Quontic said it has high standards for crypto customers.

When the bitcoin ATM network approached Quontic a year ago, the company was not prepared for the bank’s compliance vetting.

It didn’t have a disaster recovery plan, it was not properly tracking the currency transaction reports (CTRs) filed to regulators, and the company’s reporting was not up to Quontic’s standards.

After working closely with the bank for a year, the company opened an account at Quontic a few weeks ago.

To Schnall, such professionalism is necessary for crypto startups to be taken seriously.

“You don’t have mom-and-pop financial institutions. You’re not going to have mom-and-pop crypto players of any significance,” Schnall said. “Crypto companies have to have strong controls, internal audit, and a very robust system of compliance.”

Additionally, the juice has to be worth the squeeze for Quontic to bank a crypto firm.

“There must also be a strong strategic motivation for us as well – such as meaningful deposit balances, etc.” Schnall said. “‘Meaningful’ is relative to how complex, risk-laden and labor-intensive the account will be.”

Zscaler ThreatLabZ team came across the new malware, called Saefko, which is written in .NET and has multiple functionalities. It belongs to the Remote Access Tool (RAT) family, enabling cybercriminals to take over accounts and automate fraud through opening a backdoor for remote control of the targeted computer.

Once installed on the device, fraudsters easily gain access to victim machines to steal credentials, monitor user behavior by logging keystrokes, activating the system’s webcam, taking screenshots, formatting drives, and more. In other words, the intruder can do just about anything on the targeted computer, researchers said.

Zscaler ThreatLabZ team explains that RATs are usually downloaded when a user opens an email attachment or install infected apps or games to his device.

Most alarmingly though, is that Saefko employs a number of tactics to fetch the chrome browser history looking for specific types of activities, such as those involving credit cards, business, social media, gaming, cryptocurrency, and shopping.

Among other things, it searches for particular crypto websites that have been visited by the user and sends collected data to its server for further instructions. The malware also looks for cryptocurrency info on the system to check if it’s worth compromising and then uses a hidden updater tool to control infrastructure and initiate the process of stealing the cryptocurrency via a second-stage installation.

According to the researchers’ findings, the list of crypto sites it searches includes:

etoro.com 24option.com puatrack.com/coinbull2/ luno.com paxforex.com binance.com coinbase.com cex.io changelly.com coinmama.com xtrade.ae capital.com paxful.com kraken.com poloniex.com gemini.com bithumb.com xcoins.io cobinhood.com coincheck.com coinexchange.io shapeshift.io bitso.com indacoin.com cityindex.co.uk bitbay.net bitstamp.net cryptopia.co.nz pro.coinbase.com kucoin.com bitpanda.com foxbit.com.br bitflyer.com bitfinex.com bit-z.com quadrigacx.com quadrigacx.com big.one lakebtc.com wex.nz kuna.io yobit.io zebpay.com hitbtc.com bx.in.th trezor.io electrum.org blockchain.com crypto.robinhood.com exodus.io mycelium.com bitcointalk.org btc-e.com moonbit.co.in bitcoinaliens.com bitcoinwisdom.com coindesk.com cointelegraph.com ccn.com reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/ bitcoin.org/en/blog newsbtc.com blog.spectrocoin.com blog.coinbase.com bitcoinist.com forklog.com abitcoinc.com bitcoin.stackexchange.com news.bitcoin.com blog.bitfinex.com blog.genesis-mining.com

Saefko only installs itself if it thinks it will go undetected and after one computer on a network is infected, the malware will try to infect other systems on the network to spread the infection.

The report goes on to say that cryptocurrency holders should be especially careful because it is almost impossible to recover any stolen coins.

“To protect systems from RATs, users must refrain from downloading programs or opening attachments that aren’t from a trusted source. At the administrative level, it’s always a good idea to block unused ports, turn off unused services, and monitor outgoing traffic. Attackers are often careful to prevent the malware from doing too much activity at once, which would slow down the system and possibly attract the attention of the user and IT,” it explains.",2019-08-09 20:58:09+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/dash-chainlocks-bitcoin/,"Get daily crypto briefings and weekly Bitcoin market reports delivered right to your inbox.

The Dash (DASH) network is now more secure than Bitcoin (BTC), according to several executives of the core team. An upgraded consensus protocol and instant-by-default transactions are expected give Dash significant advantages in user experience and the network’s utility.

Known as LLMQ-based ChainLocks, the upgrade uses masternodes to ‘lock’ new blocks, thereby preventing network forks or double-spends. Each successful block becomes immutable as soon as it is broadcast, making its transactions irreversible.

According to Fernando Gutierrez, Dash Core CMO, ChainLocks make 51% attacks and reorgs prohibitively expensive. “We don’t think that it makes sense to measure security in terms of hashing power, but in how much it would cost to make a successful attack,” he explained. “With that criteria, Dash is the most secure blockchain.”

Combined with LLMQ-based InstantSend transactions, ChainLocks allow Dash transactions to settle in seconds, allowing recipients to spend tokens as soon as they are received. Gutierrez believes this improved functionality will improve adoption as well as open up whole new use-cases.

One such area is remittances. “By being able to instantly re-spend the funds that you receive,” Gutierrez said, “things like remittances can be done with seconds’ notice, which is unthinkable with other remittance methods.”

It also plays right into Dash’s main userbase, which includes struggling economies such as Venezuela as well as migrant workers looking to send money to their home countries. Although still difficult to buy, Dash effectively provides a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional remittance solutions, like Western Union or MoneyGram.

Dash is not the only proof-of-work blockchain to offer improved network utility. Competing projects like Bitcoin Cash or Satoshi’s Vision have attempted faster transactions through measures like larger blocks or 0-conf transactions, but with mixed success.

Although advocates say larger blocks vastly improved scalability, a BitMEX report recently found BSV nodes struggling to cope with larger block-sizes. As a result, nodes ended up on different chains, at different heights. The network had effectively forked, threatening the overall security of the blockchain.

According to 420 Bitcoin SV peers, the nodes are currently on different chains and at different heights: * 65% at the current tip

* 17% stuck on a large 210MB block

* 19% on the old pre-hardfork chain pic.twitter.com/hO98lFX9Zw — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) August 3, 2019

“Better Than Bitcoin”

Fully implemented in early July, Dash Core says they have not yet seen any protocol that really compares to ChainLocks. Gutierrez points out that while some projects, including Bitcoin, rely on implemented checkpoints at preset intervals, ChainLocks is “vastly superior” because it happens in “a completely decentralized and secure way.”

ChainLocks may sound like a boring backend improvement, but it adds a new layer of security notably absent from other blockchains.

“It doesn’t matter if someone is mining a longer chain in secret in a 51% attack,” Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor told Crypto Briefing in an earlier interview. “Someone could have 99% of the network power, but if anyone else publishes their block first, the chain becomes invalid.”

While Bitcoin may have the most mining clout, ChainLocks gives Dash a unique security and usability advantage. “This level of network consensus can be reached extremely quickly and reaches, I would argue, better than bitcoin security in four to six seconds,” he added.

The debit card, which can also be used to make ATM withdrawals, will be launched in early Q4 of this year.

Prior to making purchases with the card, users must reportedly select the balance of either fiat or cryptocurrency (“bitcoin, ripple, ethereum, litecoin, or dozens of other coins”) that they wish to be debited.

CoinZoom founder and CEO Todd Crosland said in an official statement that Visa’s position as a global leader in payments was a “tremendous asset” to the exchange. However, CoinZoom’s isn’t the only crypto debit card that Visa has signed onto its platform.

According to Bitcoin.com, Wirex’ Visa-based debit card is a “popular choice in Europe” that “supports conversion from several major cryptocurrencies and provides a 0.5% BTC cashback on in-store purchases.” In the US, Bitpay’s Visa card can be used to purchase things from Visa-enable merchants around the world; Hong Kong-based payment processor Crypto.com’s MCO Visa card has allowed users to spend BCH since May of 2018–the list goes on and on.

Still, CoinZoom is hoping to set itself apart with a few features: along with the Visa card, the exchange is launching a mobile trading app on iOS and Android that contains a virtual copy of the CoinZoom Visa Card. The app can also be used to track and manage card transactions.

Efforts toward global expansion

The launch of the debit card is the latest move in Coinzoom’s initiative for global expansion and greater adoption. In January, Finance Magnates reported that CoinZoom opened offices in Dublin, Ireland; in December of 2018, the exchange was granted a license from Austrac, Australia’s financial watchdog, to begin operations down under.

In May, investment firm Seed Equity Capital rebranded to “CoinZoom Securities.” At the time, CEO Todd Crosland said that “the new name…allows us to emphasize our wide-ranging business objective around changing the way that capital is being raised, with the goal of increasing access, lowering costs and improving regulatory compliance particularly with the issuance of digital securities.”

This law needs to be changed in a way that leaves these transactions tax free and imposes a tax only when one “cashes out” from cryptocurrency to the dollar. If left untouched, this law will drive even more innovation overseas and further hurt U.S. innovation and entrepreneurship.

For those unfamiliar with cryptocurrency, it is an alternative form of value that people can use in lieu of fiat currency, like euros or the dollar. Cryptocurrency is a digital asset that is frequently exchanged in peer-to-peer networks or ‘exchanges’ that allow one individual to use a cryptocurrency to purchase another cryptocurrency. The transactions are then recorded on something called a blockchain ledger.

SEE ALSO: Is Bitcoin a Haven for Financial Crimes?

The nature of these transactions creates a more efficient means of purchasing products or services than traditional banking instruments like credit cards. The system has experienced some wild swings in value, yet, over time, the value of these assets will stabilize, and people will eventually use them to purchase goods and services like they use a credit card, debit card or cash.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently sent letters to the holders of cryptocurrency in an effort to collect taxes from these people. Ryan Ellis wrote in The Washington Examiner last week, “One perennial challenge faced by tax policymakers and regulators is that the real world changes much faster than laws and tax rules do. The latest sign of that cropped up last week, as the IRS announced it was sending 10,000 ‘educational letters’ to taxpayers it suspects had taxable income from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) in 2018. This comes on the heels of a ‘virtual currency compliance campaign’ the IRS conducted that year. The purpose of these letters is to encourage affected taxpayers to consider amending their tax returns to include this income.”

One problem is that no guidance has been given to the holders of cryptocurrency, and an individual who has made hundreds of crypto-to-crypto transactions will have a very difficult time complying with these requirements. It would make more sense to tax when an individual goes from fiat to crypto and tax the difference from when they convert their crypto back to fiat.

Representative Ted Budd (R-N.C.) has taken a swipe at this issue and introduced a bill to reform the “Like-Kind” exclusion of cryptocurrency from taxation imposed by the Trump tax bill. The blockchain industry is still in its infancy, and different tokens and products should likely be taxed differently, whether they be security tokens, utility tokens or any of the new dynamic emerging products. Without temporary restoration of Like-Kind treatment, we will see tremendous overseas flight of American blockchain and crypto companies to avoid the crippling tax burden and uncertainty in the United States. The Budd bill is a band-aid, because Like-Kind treatment is admittedly not the ideal long-term way to tax all token-to-token transactions, but it makes sense in the short term as the industry matures.

My organization, the Digital Asset Policy Network (DAPNet) is committed to pushing for legislation that would accomplish a few specific goals. First, we need the law changed to stop punishing people who are innovating in the cryptocurrency space through a harsh tax policy that will likely push more innovators overseas rather than collecting any more tax revenue. Second, we need a long-term strategy and a new tax treatment of cryptocurrency that allows for crypto-to-crypto exchanges without any penalty, including retroactivity, to end the current push by the IRS to collect for Like-Kind crypto-to-crypto transactions. Finally, we need a comprehensive legislative fix that promotes, rather than punishes, this growing area which provides an alternative to big banks and credit card companies as a way to increase competition and lower cost for consumers.

Digital assets are the future of “money” and allow individuals to have more freedom from the fees associated with purchasing products and services. It provides a real competition to government printed cash in a way that will make lives better without the constant fees associated with financial institutions who nickel-and-dime people with fees that end up slowing down our economic system. Freedom dictates that individuals should have choice and the freedom to engage in transactions as they choose. Cryptocurrency provides that freedom and will make America even greater, if the government does not screw it up.

The two things don’t often go hand in hand due to how closely the two crypto asset types are connected, yet growing regulatory pressure and other important factors have caused a massive divergence in their price correlation.

Sentiment around altcoins is at extreme lows, yet the majority of the crypto market believes that Bitcoin is about to embark on its next bull run. But with altcoin sentiment in the gutter, could the fear, uncertainty, and doubt eventually spill over into Bitcoin and cause its bull rally to collapse? One crypto pundit believes so and says that “the weakest link of the chain breaks first.”

Weakest Link of the (Block)Chain Breaks First

During 2017, the blockchain and crypto hype train took Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the rest of the market to all-time highs and many millionaires. It only further created a bubble, sucking in retail investors who bought the top of these rallies, and now are stuck holding assets that are 99% below the value they bought in at.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin hit its rock bottom back in December 2018, and ever since has been on a steady climb back toward its all-time high of $20,000 it set the year prior. Bitcoin’s climb sucked any meager gains the altcoin market was privy to right out of it, as it broke through resistance after resistance and took the media by storm.

However, even Bitcoin has slowed, failed to reach the same level of interest is saw during the 2017 bull run, and is now at an inflection point where the next major price movement could dictate the trend for not only Bitcoin, but the entire crypto market for the coming weeks to months, even years ahead.

But could it actually be negative sentiment surrounding altcoins and the key factors driving that decline that is causing Bitcoin price to collapse? Crypto pundit and gold bug Peter Schiff believes so, and took the opportunity to blast both Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto space.

Those arguing the collapse of altcoins validates Bitcoin are whistling past the crypto graveyard. Altcoin demand drives the Bitcoin on-ramp. The weakest links of a chain break first. Once confidence in altcoins is lost, Bitcoin is next. The similarities outweigh the differences. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) August 10, 2019

The famed gold investor says that “once confidence in altcoins is lost, Bitcoin is next,” and says its due to how “altcoin demand drives the Bitcoin on-ramp.”

While Schiff’s comments should be taken with a grain of salt given how frequently he bashes Bitcoin and crypto due to his vest interests in the gold market, there’s no denying that altcoin sentiment could harm Bitcoin.

Why Bitcoin Won’t Fail Due to Altcoin Fallout

But what Schiff doesn’t seem to understand is that there are different factors driving the altcoin sell pressure, and one of those factors is Bitcoin itself.

The altcoin on-ramp phase has also been over for nearly a year now. Bitcoin’s rally has absorbing all of the buy pressure form the market, and even sucking up altcoin capital. Bitcoin’s rally has also been driven in part by institutions, whereas altcoins are almost entirely retail-driven.

Altcoins also are still so far from their all-time high prices, while holders are forced to sit back and watch values fall further all while Bitcoin climbs. The psychology is enough to cause further capitulation in altcoins alone.

On top of that, confusion and lack of clarity around which altcoins are legal to hold under the coming regulatory framework has caused widespread panic across the market. The regulatory framework is cutting off access to the majority of the altcoin market, making matters even worse for altcoins hit the hardest.

A large scale attack against privacy

The official Twitter exchange of cryptocurrency exchange Binance claimed that a major attack against users of altcoin Litecoin took place yesterday. The firm made this claim in a tweet on Aug. 9:

“Approximately 5 hours ago there was a large-scale dusting attack on $LTC @Litecoin users.”

The tweet also links to a transaction — which according to Binance is part of the attack — sending a fraction (0.00000546 LTC) of a coin to 50 addresses. Furthermore, the exchange also links to an explanation of a dusting attack, which defines it in the following way:

“A dusting attack refers to a relatively new kind of malicious activity where hackers and scammers try and break the privacy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users by sending tiny amounts of coins to their personal wallets.”

A data acquisition strategy

The way this kind of attack works is that the attacker can then track down the transactional activity of these wallets. By analyzing this data, the attacker tries to determine the identity of who controls those wallets.

As Cointelegraph reported at the end of the January, research at the time cited dusting as one of the major threats to cryptocurrencies.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/35493/chinas-central-bank-digital-currency-is-ready-after-5-years-of-development,,,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-is-david-marcus-bitcoin-believer-turned-facebooks-libra-boss,"David Marcus, the man spearheading Facebook’s blockchain effort, has gotten a tremendous amount of spotlight lately. The rapid emergence of Libra has dominated the coverage of other crypto-related developments, as it became apparent that the social media giant’s inroad into the realm of digital assets will have most serious consequences for both the blockchain sector and the global financial system in general.

While previously the crypto industry has hardly ever had one key spokesperson — which is perhaps a natural and welcome state of affairs for a domain wherein decentralization is the most cherished of values — Libra’s newfound position at the center of global-level regulatory debate about the future shape of finance propels the project’s charismatic head to serve as the envoy for the whole cryptocurrency space.

Like it or not, old-school legislators in the United States and beyond are used to dealing with specific people representing interest groups and industry associations, so Marcus’ two appearances before the U.S. Congress have likely rendered him not just “Mr. Facebook Cryptocurrency,” but simply “Mr. Cryptocurrency” in the eyes of many people in high offices. But how did a Paris-born, Geneva-raised college dropout end up in this capacity of prominence?

From Geneva to Silicon Valley

Born into a Romanian-Iranian family in Paris, the future head of Libra was raised in Switzerland, where he attended the University of Geneva. Like so many of his future tech industry colleagues, he left school long before earning a degree in order to focus on an entrepreneurial career. At aged 23, Marcus founded his first startup — a telecom carrier — which was acquired by a larger integrated communications corporation after four years under his leadership. His first experience with payments came after he established a mobile media monetization company, Echovox, whose feats, among others, included facilitating SMS voting for big-name TV shows.

Zong, a spin-off from Echovox, has successfully establishing a payments network that allowed users to make purchases through mobile carrier billing. Putting up such a service on a large scale took Marcus negotiating with hundreds of mobile operators and thousands of merchants. It was Zong’s success that projected Marcus to the position of PayPal’s vice president of mobile upon the payment behemoth’s acquisition of the startup. It came in handy that PayPal had been bracing to ramp up its mobile services, for which task Marcus’ experience proved invaluable. In 2012, he was promoted to be the company’s president, directing the explosive growth of one of the world’s largest payment platforms.

In 2014, Mark Zuckerberg seduced Marcus to join Facebook as the head of messaging products. Marcus cited his willingness to go back to managing smaller teams (PayPal counted some 15,000 employees at the end of his term) and to build consumer-facing products and services in a more energetic startup-like environment. Under his leadership, Facebook Messenger substantially grew in terms of the number of active users and saw several improvements in its functionality — including the introduction of tools facilitating the interaction between retailers and their customers, such as chatbots supporting payments.

Marcus led Messenger for four years before the entirely new chapter of his career opened with Facebook’s announcement of him taking charge of the newly established exploratory blockchain task force — the initiative now known as Libra.

Early adopter

David Marcus is believed to be among the first in the world of big tech to start experimenting with cryptocurrencies, as Asaf Fybish, co-founder of blockchain marketing firm GuerrillaBuzz, told Cointelegraph:

“David Marcus is actually considered as one of the first top Silicon Valley executives to adopt and support bitcoin. In 2013, at the LeWeb conference in Paris, Marcus stated the fact that he is a big fan of bitcoin and owns a stash of it. He called bitcoin a store of value and a distributed ledger. Getting this type of support back in 2013 was pretty exciting and we can tell that David has a sense when it comes to blockchain and cryptocurrencies in particular.”

“Digital Gold,” a book authored by journalist Nathaniel Popper, mentions Marcus alongside the founders of the Gemini digital currency exchange (i.e., Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss), co-chairman of Fortress Investment Group Peter Briger, and entrepreneur Wences Casares as high-profile technology executives invested in Bitcoin since at least 2013. Popper claims that Marcus got so fascinated by the original digital asset that he at some point considered quitting PayPal to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.

In April 2013, Marcus admitted that PayPal was looking into possible ways to incorporate Bitcoin in the payment company’s operations, saying:

“So I’ve been spending a lot of time looking at it, and it’s truly fascinating actually: the way that the currency’s been designed, and the way that inflation is built in to pay for miners, and all that is truly fascinating. I think that for us at PayPal, it’s just a question whether Bitcoin will make its way to PayPal’s funding instrument or not.”

Later the same year, speaking at the aforementioned LeWeb conference, Marcus opined that cryptocurrencies had a greater chance of revolutionizing the payments industry within the next 10 years than, say, NFC tap-to-pay technology.

Although it initially might have seemed that the move to Facebook had lured Marcus much farther away from his cryptocurrency aspirations than he was at PayPal, destiny took him full circle to end up at the helm of the social platform’s blockchain project just a few years later. Some people in the industry draw direct comparisons between Libra and the payments network Marcus once managed. Ruud Feltkamp, CEO and co-founder of crypto trading platform Cryptohopper, told Cointelegraph:

“Here at Cryptohopper, we often asked ourselves: why is nobody creating the ‘PayPal of Crypto’? Great to see it’s actually their former president that is now leading Libra. Regardless of what you think of Facebook, their entrance marks the start of the big companies entering crypto. Next up, Google?”

While at PayPal, Marcus remained in a wait-and-see mode, saying in a 2014 interview that it was critical for a payments company present in more than 90 countries to understand the regulatory implications of starting to accept cryptocurrency across all its jurisdictions. At the time, apparently, he couldn’t see a realistic way to make it happen, as PayPal lacked the consumer base and economic power that enabled Facebook to come up with a global cryptocurrency plan five years after.

Scaling blockchains

One of Marcus’ main competences is gracefully cutting through the miles of red tape that inevitably accompany scaling a global payment system to millions of dollars worth of transactions per minute: He enthusiastically spoke about that facet of his work as early as in 2012. Even before the Libra appointment, this skill had won him a position on the Coinbase board of directors, as the crypto trading platform was scrambling toward the end of 2017 to handle a surge in both crypto prices and the number of crypto investors.

Marcus expressed his enthusiasm for this chance to help Coinbase “democratize access to cryptocurrencies, and deliver on the mission to create an open financial system for the world.” However, his tenure with the exchange only lasted for several months before he had to step down in a move that signaled Facebook’s stepping-up its own blockchain effort.

Prior to unveiling Libra, Marcus projected Facebook’s cautious stance on cryptocurrency — for example, citing the functional hurdles in the way of blockchain-enabled payments — saying:

“Payments using crypto right now is just very expensive, super slow, so the various communities running the different blockchains and the different assets need to fix all the issues, and then when we get there someday, maybe we’ll do something.”

He also sided with Zuckerberg in the wake of the controversial decision to ban all crypto-related ads, supporting the view that most of them were a scam anyway and that the ban has been necessary in order to protect users.

Stephanie So, co-founder and chief development officer of blockchain security startup Geeq, observed to Cointelegraph that Marcus is well qualified for his job, but that this should not eliminate concerns over Libra’s governance model:

“I would say that David Marcus clearly has spent his career running and understanding the payments industry. If there were to be a play for a group of private corporations to start an alternative global currency to dominate retail transactions, Marcus' experience in finance at the rate of billions of transactions and dollars, and with world regulators might make sense.”

So also agrees with the views that Marcus outlined in his hearing before the U.S. Congress. She said:

“I also agree with what he apparently stated in his Congressional testimony: blockchain technology is inevitable. However, as you know, blockchain technology is not well understood. In spite of most blockchains' ideological tendencies toward inclusion and self-governance, there are reasons blockchain has not been widely adopted yet, and that is because there are potentially major gaps in their security models, which means (or should mean) that traditional financial institutions should not be ready to move to blockchain yet.”

The real “mensch”

Unlike many tech executives that hold prominent positions in Silicon Valley for decades without openly expressing their views out in the public, Marcus never shied away it — and in quite a passionate fashion. Hill Ferguson, Marcus’ colleague at Zong and then at PayPal, once testified to the Financial Times that the Libra boss is not missing a human element in him, “He can be a great, persuasive person around a vision but he combines that with being a genuinely solid person — or a ‘mensch’, as he would say — and he really is that in the truest sense of the word.”

A notorious, inadvertent expression of how Marcus takes what he does to heart emerged in 2014, when the then-PayPal president lambasted the company’s employees for their reluctance to use PayPal’s own products, calling it “unacceptable” and implying that those who didn’t use the app or forgot the password would be better off to “find something that will connect with your heart and mind elsewhere.”

In another instance, Marcus took to social media to express his rather strong opinions amid the 2018 spat between Facebook management and Brian Acton, the co-founder of WhatsApp. Referring to Acton, Marcus wrote that he found “attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire, and went to an unprecedented extent to shield and accommodate you for years, low-class.”

Overall, a review of Marcus’ record suggests that, regardless of one’s feelings toward Facebook and Libra, he is fairly well qualified to represent the crypto space before the world’s powerful. While his early involvement with Bitcoin attests to the authenticity of his pro-crypto claims, Marcus’ experience with the global payments market and pro-consumer orientation gives hope that he might at least make an honest attempt to steer Libra in the direction of social good.",,https://www.pcmag.com/news/black-hat-attendees-sponsored-session-was-snake-oil-crypto,"LAS VEGAS—The Black Hat security conference is no stranger to controversy, but that's usually limited to daring hacks or heated debates about privacy. This year, a sponsored session drew ridicule from attendees who claim it was little more than pseudoscience, and the uproar prompted Black Hat organizers to remove the content from the website.

Black Hat bills itself as a premier gathering of security researchers and industry, offering training sessions and extensive talks on security topics; we've written about several over the past week. Black Hat also offers sponsored sessions. These are talks put on by companies in the security industry—usually big names like RSA, AWS, Bitdefender, and others—and are listed separately from the sessions presented by researchers.

Regular sessions at Black Hat have to pass muster with the organization's review board, but that appears to not be the case for sponsored sessions.

The name of the sponsored session in question is quite a mouthful: ""The 2019 Discovery of Quasi-Prime Numbers: What Does This Mean For Encryption?"" It was presented by Robert E. Grant, and the company was listed as Crown Sterling. According to the Crown Sterling website, Grant is the ""Founder, Chairman, and Managing Partner of Strathspey Crown LLC, a growth equity holding company based in Newport Beach, CA with a broad portfolio of company and asset holdings spanning healthcare, clean energy, social media, and financial technology."" The site also notes that he is ""an accomplished sculptor.""

This reporter wasn't able to attend the session, but if it's anything like this video from Crown Sterling's YouTube account, it's certainly mind-bending.

This reporter also does not have a background in advanced mathematics, but the claims made in the video are perplexing.

A new understanding of how mathematical constants interact with primes, and quasi-primes, to propogate and mirror reflect in infinite wave conjugations. Academic researchers believe this discovery may be the key to unlocking a new, unified physics cosmology: a theory of everything. [...] Time AI is an entirely new classification in data privacy called quantum encryption: an impenetrable system utilizing five dimensions of encryption technology. [...] Using the infinite variation within music composed real time with artificial intelligence, Time AI generates quantum encryption keys as unique as your own iris. Each quantum public key is paired with two quantum private key, that are entangled through mirror-symmetry mathematics in value, time-exposure, and oscillation speed. These quantum keys change at the nano-scale of time, directed by state-of-the-art AI technology harnessing time's entanglement: one key from the past and one key from the future. Changing the number series one billion times a second with no pattern. [...] To unlock time AI, the future and the past must converge perfectly in a split-second unpredictable by any known intelligence in the universe.

One of the people in the audience for Grant's talk was Jean-Philippe Aumasson, who holds a Ph.D. in cryptography and is the founder of Teserakt.

Aumasson first encountered Crown Sterling when he saw the above video some weeks ago. Upon investigating the company's website, he described it as having, ""all the signs of 'snake oil' crypto: extravagant claims, total lack of experience in the domain, no technical documentation, no testable software, no references.""

""The content of the paper and the so-called discoveries are either 1) obvious, well-known mathematical properties that any high school student would easily find, or 2) plain wrong,"" said Aumasson. For example, Aumasson told PCMag that during the Black Hat talk, Grant took credit for a discovery first attributed to the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes.

The abstract for Grant's sponsored session mentions that his ""mathematical discovery was recently published through Cornell University."" A Crown Sterling press release clarifies that the paper was published on arXiv.org, a repository for academic papers managed by Cornell University. Papers on arXiv are not peer-reviewed.

Senior Security Researcher Mark Carney also came across Grant's paper in April, and was perplexed. A Ph.D. student, Carney wrote up a critical response. While not peer-reviewed, Carney is confident in his analysis. ""I knew that if I was wrong, it was highly, highly unlikely it would be because Grant was right.""

Carney was deeply skeptical of Grant's claim to have revolutionized the process of factoring. ""To say that you have an algorithm that dramatically speeds up this process is a massive claim!"" Carney told PCMag. ""It's the kind of thing professors, postdocs, and PhD students dream of.""

Speaking to PCMag, Carney said Grant's work is, ""lacking in any rigor that would elevate it out of numerology.""

Well, I did allude to a draft preprint of some arguments that point out the major issues with Grant's paper he is presenting at @BlackHatEvents. Here is that draft:

Reviewing Recent Prime Generation Methods for Breaking Cryptographic Keyshttps://t.co/LBohVHuEOK https://t.co/FjTHBioi0Y — Mark C. (@LargeCardinal) August 7, 2019

Aumasson gave several examples of inaccurate statements made by Grant during the sponsored session. For example, Grant reportedly said that all encryption is based on factorization, while Aumasson explained that factorization is ""only the core problem of RSA [encryption].""

Aumasson also said Grant claimed to have an efficient method to recognize prime numbers, but did not appear aware of the AKS primality test, an accepted algorithm for testing prime numbers, when asked how his method compared. Grant was also reportedly asked why he has not submitted his methodology to an academic conference ""He replied that he thinks he does not have to,"" said Aumasson.

Grant also reportedly said that electrons are from the past, positrons are from the future. ""So, to summarize, it's the flat Earthers of crypto,"" said Aumasson, referencing people who, despite all available evidence, believe our planet to be flat.

Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, was also in attendance at Grant's sponsored session. In the video below, he can be heard confronting Grant. Guido told PCMag that the presentation amounted to ""word soup.""

""They're scamming people. They're here to use Black Hat to trick people into giving them money,"" Guido told PCMag. ""Other people in the audience tried to reason with them, that the math isn't right, etc., but they don't care about that. It's offensive, and they shouldn't get the benefit of using our names and our event to commit fraud.

""They're not here to engage with anyone in honest conversation. They need to get chased out of the event and exposed for what they are.""

I yelled at the Time AI guy. It's ok to get angry at someone trying to harm people. I was shocked that more people haven't done the same. https://t.co/Mwe7yrihgk — Dan Guido (@dguido) August 8, 2019

""I want it easily discoverable on Google that this company is a fraud,"" Guido told PCMag. ""I also hope that Black Hat screens its sponsors for clear indications of fraud.""

This company is going to use photos and video from @BlackHatEvents to legitimize themselves for months. Blackhat should exercise copyright over their logo to take it all down. https://t.co/GKrNIjoolZ — Dan Guido (@dguido) August 8, 2019

Crown Sterling and Robert Grant did not immediately respond to PCMag's request for comment.

While Aumasson felt the sponsored session was without rigorous, scientific merit, he doesn't think Black Hat organizers are to blame. ""It's unfortunate to have such clowns given a mic,"" said Aumasson. He stressed that it's not unusual for conferences to offer time to companies that sponsor them, and Black Hat clearly marked Grant's talked as a sponsored session.

""I do not blame [Black Hat] at all for it, and it's a marginal case, so again not sure they need to take action,"" he said. ""And well, it was a good laugh.""

Black Hat organizers told PCMag: ""We are aware of the situation with the Crown Sterling talk and will be removing it from our website as soon as possible. Content discussed in Black Hat sponsored sessions are determined by the individual sponsor, however, we are working to implement a stronger vetting process moving forward to avoid this happening in the future.""

As of writing, the Crown Sterling materials have been removed from the Black Hat website.

Governments worldwide are changing the way they regulate crypto assets to comply with the global cryptocurrency standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Some are amending existing laws, while others are creating a new system to cooperate and share data.

A New Crypto System

A number of countries worldwide are reportedly setting up a new cryptocurrency system to help them comply with the FATF standards. Fifteen nations are planning to create a global system “to collect and share personal data on individuals who conduct cryptocurrency transactions,” Nikkei reported on Aug. 9, noting that “the G7 members, Australia, and Singapore will develop the new system.” The G7 members are France, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, the U.K., and the U.S.

The system will be designed in consultation with the FATF with the goal “to draw up detailed measures by 2020, and to have the system up and running a few years later,” the publication elaborated:

Once in place, the system would be managed by the private sector.

In July, prior to the G7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, Reuters reported that “Japan’s government is leading a global push to set up an international network for cryptocurrency payments, similar to the SWIFT network used by banks, in an effort to fight money laundering,” quoting a person familiar with the plan. According to the news outlet, the system was proposed by the country’s Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency (FSA), and it was approved by the FATF in June.

The FATF published its final guidance for a risk-based approach to crypto assets and service providers in June. It was discussed at the G20 summit in Japan where leaders of the G20 nations and their finance ministers declared their commitments to following the FATF standards.

Monitoring Compliance

The FATF is an intergovernmental organization founded to develop policies for combating money laundering. It currently comprises 37 member jurisdictions and 2 regional organizations. After releasing its guidance, the FATF announced its plans to monitor how countries apply the recommended standards. The organization declared in June:

The FATF will monitor implementation of the new requirements by countries and service providers and conduct a 12-month review in June 2020.

While the FATF emphasized that its “guidance is non-binding and does not overrule the purview of national authorities,” countries that do not comply risk being blacklisted.

At the closing of the FATF plenary in June, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin explained that among the recommendations are the requirements for crypto service providers to “identify who they are sending funds on behalf of, and who is the recipient of those funds” and “develop processes where they are required to share that information with other providers of virtual assets, and law enforcement.” He remarked:

Under these new measures, virtual asset service providers will be required to implement the same AML/CFT requirements as traditional financial institutions.

Licensing Service Providers

In its guidance, the FATF stated that countries are obligated to “assess and mitigate their risks associated with virtual asset activities and service providers,” including to “license or register service providers and subject them to supervision or monitoring by competent national authorities.”

Several countries already require crypto service providers to be licensed by their financial authorities, such as Japan where crypto exchanges must register with the FSA. So far 19 exchanges have been registered and at least 110 more have expressed interest in registering, the agency told news.Bitcoin.com.

Some countries without any crypto licensing regime are considering implementing one to comply with FATF’s standards. South Korea, for example, is one such country. Its “Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has disclosed a plan to directly regulate cryptocurrency exchanges and bring them into the regulatory system,” Business Korea reported on Aug. 7. “Currently, the FIU indirectly controls cryptocurrency exchanges through administrative guidance to banks.”

An FIU official explained that a cryptocurrency exchange licensing system will be introduced, as recommended by the FATF. The news outlet detailed that the South Korean financial authorities are planning to revise the Act on Specified Financial Transaction Information this year “to strengthen crypto exchanges’ duty to prevent money laundering.”

A major distinction between how South Korea regulates crypto assets compared to most other countries is its real-name system. The government set up this system in January last year to reduce the risk associated with anonymity of crypto transactions, including money laundering. Any crypto exchange user wanting to withdraw or deposit Korean won must open a real-name-verified account at the bank providing this service to the exchange. However, banks are currently only providing this service to the country’s top four crypto exchanges: Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone, and Korbit.

Noting that there are nearly 200 crypto exchanges in the country and most of them are not using the real-name system, Business Korea emphasized:

If the revised bill is passed in a plenary session, it will form the legal basis on which the government refuses to register cryptocurrency exchanges that do not use real-name accounts.

According to the publication, any exchanges not using the real-name system “will be defined as unregistered exchanges and face up to five years in prison and a maximum 50 million won [~$41,116] in fines.”

Amending AML Laws

Instead of introducing new laws, some countries have opted to take the easier route of amending their existing laws to combat money laundering involving crypto assets. Thailand, for example, recently revealed a plan to amend its AML laws for this purpose, according to local media. The country started regulating crypto assets in May last year, requiring crypto exchanges to be approved by its financial authorities.

While not a member of the FATF, Thailand is a member of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering which ensures the adoption, implementation and enforcement of certain FATF recommendations.

The Thai Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo) said it will amend AML laws to include cryptocurrencies, the Bangkok Post reported on Aug. 5. Amlo acting secretary-general Pol Maj Gen Preecha Charoensahayanon plans to add a section to the country’s Anti-Money Laundering Act to require crypto exchanges to report activities to his office. He explained that this change corresponds with international standards which regulate these service providers. The news outlet noted that “Amlo officers currently do not receive complaints, or deal with, cases directly involving virtual currencies, [but] they need to stay alert.”

The Amlo chief also revealed in July a new reporting requirement for crypto exchanges. They will be required to report digital asset transactions with a value exceeding 5 million baht (~$162,547) to commercial banks, which will then report them to Amlo.

More than a decade later, the grandfather cryptocurrency is still on the peripheries of traditional finance, yet the decentralized industry that it has spawned can indeed replicate many financial services on the blockchain, all of which were formerly exclusively in the realm of banks.

Is DeFi banking?

Decentralized finance (DeFi) has quickly become a buzzword. By allowing people to connect to new decentralized lending, exchange, savings and other DeFi platforms, blockchain can provide a cryptocurrency alternative to traditional banking services, and those who are comfortable operating in this ecosystem are therefore able to wield their assets with greater fungibility. Make no mistake: DeFi is not banking, as it only mimics banking functions and is still unable to provide the other thing banks are valued for — i.e., security. Lorenzo Pellegrino, CEO of popular online payments platform Skrill, told Cointelegraph:

“Many companies claiming to be banks operate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, however almost all would find it hard to maintain that title in a regulated space. They use this terminology as it implies a level of safety and regulation found in the wider financial world, something that will most likely be missing from their product.”

Accordingly, these applications are not able to accept deposits nor to withdraw to a bank, which is a red flag. They do not defray the liability through legal precedent, and there are no investor-protection schemes covering the tokens if a smart contract goes bust. As mere footnotes to regulations that have yet to fully materialize, “cryptocurrency banks” — in the truest sense — are few and far-between. But they do exist, as blockchain solutions have matured in the hands of teams from both sides of the finance industry and as regulators begin to learn more about the revolution knocking at their door.

What’s a crypto bank?

Crypto banks are banking institutions that engage in the standard range of money-related activities like deposits and withdrawals, savings, lending and borrowing, and investing in a wider range of instruments and markets. While this also describes a standard bank perfectly, crypto banks have integrated cryptocurrency into these financial functions. They’ve also gained legality in the eyes of local financial watchdogs.

The challenge facing blockchain is twofold: It must be in a tolerating regulatory environment and have enough local talent to provide mature, trusted solutions. In places with progressive policymakers such as Germany, businesses and institutions holding fiat money and fiat-money-based assets can easily participate in the decentralized economy through a crypto bank. These kinds of crypto banks, such as Bitwala and Spot9, are essentially the skeleton of what will one day be a bridge between the segregated fiat and crypto economies, which is only now beginning to emerge.

Regulated by Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Bitwala deposits are insured by the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme up to 100,000 euros (about $113,000), just as they are for other banks regulated in Germany. Its partnership with European Union-regulated SolarisBank ensures that account holders are able to do with Bitwala the same as what they’d do with their regular bank account — i.e., get paid, pay rent and bills, exchange currencies, send interbank payments, and store money in both fiat and cryptocurrencies seamlessly.

A convincing yet futile facsimile

Due to the unique capabilities of blockchain finance, many of the largest centralized crypto firms are able to offer bank-like services for other enterprise-level businesses, even where regulations haven’t taken shape. In the United States, for example, the Securities and Exchange Commission hasn’t yet indicated that these businesses can integrate with the banking system, and for now, they’re essentially investment funds. Coinbase Custody is one of the most sophisticated examples, but it can only play being a “bank” until regulators give their approval.

Serious investors and businesses preferring to operate in full view of tax authorities and regulators will need to do the reporting legwork necessary to legally invest fiat into the tokens available on Coinbase Custody. It allows people with large investments in the crypto market to avail from segregated cold storage while enjoying seamless integration with the Coinbase Pro exchange, insurance for deposits, staking tools where available, customized reporting and third-party auditing.

Burgeoning BTC banks worldwide

What’s missing from Coinbase’s custody solution? For U.S citizens, Coinbase provides trustworthy storage and exchange, but one cannot pay bills from a Coinbase account nor receive a salary to it. When going to the movies in the U.S., crypto can be used as payment or to repay a friend (who purchased your ticket) by sending money to their bank account. A user would first need to cash out Bitcoin (BTC), for example, and send it from Coinbase to a connected bank, then from the connected bank to the user's own bank. This is because, without regulatory approval, fiat can be turned into crypto (and vice versa), but fiat and crypto do not belong to the same definition of money as it pertains to banks. Clearly there are still obstacles ahead. Skrill’s Pellegrino opined:

“While cryptocurrency will definitely play a large role in the future of payment rails, we believe that they will be complementary to the current systems, rather than in full out competition. Established payments companies like ours will be key in helping this adoption.”

It becomes more apparent as one realizes that fitting crypto to the current monetary system is the same as trying to put a square peg into a round hole. The most advanced platforms are trying their hardest to render the entrenched competition and regulators obsolete, but they forget that without transferability, one of the five properties of currency is missing from crypto.

Tokens have scarcity, durability, divisibility and fungibility down pat, but regulators are able to force a stalemate on transferability. This is why advanced platforms such as MyCryptoBank.io can use fiat-pegged stablecoins for free cross-border transactions, spending and investing — but the second a user decides to hold real USD or equities (and not blockchain derivatives), there is a problem. Regulators can prevent this movement of cryptocurrencies and create roadblocks for individuals to use their own money for their own purposes, or even transfer their funds into fiat currencies.

Banking is more a label than a verb

People want to be able to use their money for everything, not 90% of everything. Derivative instruments or precariously stacked debit card solutions built on tenuous partnerships aren’t enough. A recent McKinsey report concurs. Without regulatory approval, all blockchain finance is subject to the underlying fiat market’s three to five day settlement time. According to the report, “If counterparties were to exchange cryptocurrency assets (digital currencies that do not need a central regulating body) rather than fiat currencies, for example, payments could be made and settled in minutes via blockchain, rather than in days as with current systems.”

Slow steps toward the universal recognition that cryptocurrency can store and transmit value are being made, but it’s slower where progress counts most. As cryptocurrency finds its legs in the coming years, integrated economies with the most liberal banking authorities will benefit most. With the oldest cryptocurrency still on the fringes of finance, it’s safe to predict that mainstream acceptance is still a ways off.",,https://www.coindesk.com/trumps-currency-war-with-china-is-bitcoins-do-or-die-moment,"Michael J.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

The global economy faces its biggest crisis in 11 years.

In theory, this should be bitcoin’s moment to shine, a chance to prove itself as an uncorrelated asset immune from political risks. Eventually, that result may bear out. But a rocky road lies ahead – for bitcoiners and nocoiners alike.

Before we do the bitcoin up-or-down game, let’s dive into why the current situation in global finance is so disturbing.

The Backdrop

It all begun last Monday, when Beijing let the renminbi fall below RMB7.0 to the dollar.

Almost immediately, the U.S. Treasury Department said it would take the rare step of labeling China a “currency manipulator,” a move that, in theory, would give the Trump Administration legal cover to impose punitive sanctions against Chinese. Markets freaked out at the specter of a currency war, a tit-for-tat feedback loop of exchange rate depreciations fueling a destructive downward spiral in trade and growth.

Now, that fear may never play out.

On Thursday, the People’s Bank of China helped assuage investors’ fears. In buying more renminbi to stabilize its value, it signaled that it isn’t, for now, intending to aggressively use its currency as a trade weapon.

Also, the U.S. pronouncement made no sense. By the Treasury Department’s own definition, manipulation entails persistent, one-sided intervention in markets to weaken the domestic currency. But the renminbi’s fall came because the PBOC briefly had pared back its prior interventions supporting it.

If anything, China has persistently done the opposite of market manipulation over the past five years, propping up its currency against a market that wanted to take it lower, all in order to refocus the country’s economic growth model away from a dependence on foreign exports.

On that basis, there’s no way the International Monetary Fund or World Trade Organization would support the Trump Administration’s case that China is a currency manipulator, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to very harmful international sanctions if it were to unilaterally hit China with retribution on that basis.

The Ripple Effect

The problem is the global political and economic environment doesn’t build confidence that politicians will act rationally. Facts and multilateral institutions’ views carry less weight in an era when major Western nations are retreating from the neoliberal norms of the nineties and aughts. So, don’t be surprised if we see even more extreme market turmoil over currency-war risk in the near future.

Any escalation would play out in a global spiral. A weaker renminbi means all other countries that trade with China are also disadvantaged. So, they’ll also feel compelled to weaken their currencies, which means their trading partners will, in turn, feel pressured to do so.

Any countries with nominally free-floating currencies won’t do this via intervention or outright devaluation; instead, they’ll use interest rate cuts, which soften demand for their currencies and so have a similar effect. Central banks don’t even need to justify such cuts in currency terms; they’ll just note that a global trade war is undermining the domestic economic outlook.

Already, New Zealand, India and Thailand have announced interest rate cuts in response to the renminbi’s decline. Meanwhile, bond markets are expressing investors’ worst fears: the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is now almost below that of the three-month T-bill, ominously close to an “inverted yield curve,” which has traditionally signaled impending recession and much weaker monetary policy from the Federal Reserve.

This low-interest environment is eating into banks costs. This is why Swiss bank UBS is now charging large depositors a fee to hold money at the bank – a negative interest rate play that angers savers.

The scariest image here is not one of rebellion by angry rich savers, or even of a repeat of the heavy market turmoil of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis or the even more extreme losses of 2008-2009. It’s that a currency war in which the U.S. is a deliberate belligerent would look more like the 1930s.

That’s when the end of the gold standard and the U.S. Smoot-Hawley tariff law combined to spur a global cycle of devaluations that extended and widened the Great Depression. The ensuing international tensions fanned the flames of the Second World War.

Of course, this is not the 1930s. We have a far more globalized economy, and we have the Internet. This greater interconnectivity, economists and political scientists often argue, will compel people, businesses and their politicians to resist conflict, economic or otherwise.

But we also now know that interconnectivity, at least in its current “Web 2.0” format, has been highly disruptive to a political establishment that used to champion pro-globalization, pro-free trade policies.

Google’s and Facebook’s centralized, data-mining algorithms have created echo chambers of dopamine-addicted group-thinkers, which, along with disinformation bots and “fake news,” have weakened the mainstream media outlets around which that establishment once revolved.

The ‘Buy Bitcoin’ Argument

Whether you’re cheering for its demise or not, the liberal vision of the nation-state is under threat, and that’s sowing chaos. On one side, the Internet has enabled new, transnational groups with loyalties that transcend their countries’ interests. On the other, this dislocation has fostered a backlash from defenders of the pre-liberal order of hardline state power.

This same past week’s images of China’s violent crackdown in Hong Kong, where protesters desperately attempted to neutralize Beijing’s frightening digital surveillance, is a prime example. Another is Trump’s militaristic rhetoric.",2019-08-12 02:30:06+00:00,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/in-wild-crypto-week-bitcoin-gains-and-grabs-bigger-market-share/articleshow/70626952.cms,"Bloomberg

In another wild week for digital assets, Bitcoin extended its dominance, grabbing a greater share of the cryptocurrency market as most alternative coins declined.Bitcoin now makes up close to three-quarters of the entire crypto universe, according to data from Coinmarketcap .com. Its market capitalization is above $211 billion, 10 times that of the next-largest digital asset, Ether. And in a week when traditional financial markets were roiled, its price has held up, too: Bitcoin rose 14% over the seven days through Friday, while prices for alternative assets including Ether and XRP dropped.“As much as Bitcoin was a risky asset class, I think alt coins are significantly riskier,” said Yoni Assia, co-founder and chief executive officer of online trading platform EToro, in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters. “A lot of people got burned or had a bad experience during crypto winter,” he said, referring to a period toward the end of 2018 when digital assets sold off precipitously. Investors who held alternative coins saw their values drop by 90% sometimes, he added.As the trade war between the U.S. and China intensified this week, with tit-for-tat retaliations rocking markets the world over, investors sought shelter in safer assets, including sovereign bonds and gold. But analysts and investors alike posited that Bitcoin also benefited from the turbulence given the sudden spike in geopolitical tensions and the coin’s isolation from government control.“Are people buying Bitcoin because it’s a speculative asset class and borrowing is now cheaper? Or: There’s a lot of global uncertainty and this caught a lot of traders and asset managers off guard so they’re flocking to an uncorrelated asset right now?” asked David Martin, chief investment officer at Blockforce Capital. “You can make an argument for both right now.”But many are warning: there are perils to jumping into Bitcoin as a safe haven. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, at times posting tremendous losses in a matter of minutes. In June, for instance, Bitcoin frenzy pushed its price to nearly $14,000 only to quickly reverse course to around $10,000.Such price swings are reminiscent of 2018, when crypto assets suffered a prolonged spell that saw Bitcoin lose more than 70%. And it was earlier this year that its price languished around $3,600.“Saying Bitcoin is a safe haven is a bit of a paradox because it’s a very high-risk asset class,” said EToro’s Assia. “It’s an alternative store of value, not necessarily a safe haven.”",,https://www.coindesk.com/derivatives-drama-the-unintended-consequences-of-crypto-regulation,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s Director of Research.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter for institutional investors interested in crypto assets. Sign up here.

Last week’s kerfuffle over the launch-that-wasn’t of LedgerX’s physically delivered futures platform highlights two very important lessons, one obvious and one less so.

The obvious conclusion is that one needs to tread very carefully when it comes to claiming regulatory approval. LedgerX announced the launch of its retail physically delivered bitcoin futures platform, only to find that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had not yet approved a necessary amendment to its clearing license. Tensions flared and the launch was subsequently walked back.

The confusion over the licensing process is a hindrance, but an understandable one given the complexity of the new products (physically settled bitcoin futures have many more moving parts than traditional futures, even beyond the custody issue). And the “ask for forgiveness rather than permission” approach to financial innovation is probably going to end up expensive.

Below I want to focus on the less obvious takeaway: the role of regulations in determining eventual market structure, and the danger of unintended consequences.

Apples and oranges and fruit

Obviously, established rules can encourage or discourage the take-up of new financial products. The LedgerX confusion, though, highlights a different type of barrier, also heavily influenced by regulation, but one based on relative risk rather than investor protection.

I’m talking about the difference between swaps and futures. In conversation with CoinDesk, Paul Chou pointed out that “the difference between futures and swaps is ridiculous, it’s the same product.” This is not true. While their hedging and speculative properties may be identical and their economic outcomes similar, in the eyes of regulators they are very different.

Before digging into why, let’s pull apart the semantics. A “future” is an agreement to pay a certain price for something at a fixed point in the future. A “swap,” on the other hand, is the commitment to exchange cash flows. In bitcoin, this could mean something as simple as “I’ll send you fixed payments in exchange for variable payments based on the bitcoin price.” Structured a certain way, the net effect could be the same as a futures contract.

But the markets are very different. Futures are standardized products that trade on exchanges. Swaps, on the other hand, evolved as bilateral contracts negotiated between two parties. They traded over-the-counter in opaque markets until the 2008 crisis revealed the size of the outstanding risk and the convoluted web of obligations that had not taken counterparty default into consideration.

The Dodd-Frank financial regulation bill, enacted by Congress in 2010, mandated that most swaps move towards a standardized model and be traded on and cleared by centralized intermediaries. The aim was to add transparency and reduce risk, while enhancing liquidity. The result was a bifurcated derivatives system that skews development momentum in the direction of futures.

Why? Because of cost.

Ebb and flow

Centrally cleared financial swaps require a much** higher margin than futures. In part, this is most likely due to the perceived relative illiquidity in swaps.

It could also be to compensate the additional risk to clearing houses. With futures, a trader will ask her futures commission merchant (FCM) to place a trade on a designated contract market (DCM), where it is executed and passed along to the clearing house. If a trader’s position goes spectacularly wrong, the risk to the clearing house is partially buffered by her funds held at the FCM and the margin deposited at the DCM.

With swaps, FCMs can be used, but they are optional and a relatively new feature. Often, a trader will enter into a contract directly on a swap execution facility (SEF), which will then pass it on to a clearing house. All else being equal, fewer buffers means greater risk which justifies a higher required margin.

In markets, however, all else is rarely equal, and some swap contracts are more liquid than some futures contracts, so there is considerable pressure to amend this rule as it is seen to unjustly favor futures over swaps.

Furthermore, swaps are almost exclusively an institutional product, whereas futures are also traded by retail investors. Most other financial regulations operate on the assumption that institutions understand and accept extra risk – asking them to pay more than they deem fair will nudge their business into other product types.

True, as always with financial regulation, there is a matrix of other causes and consequences to consider, and loopholes and exceptions keep lawyers busy.

But the point is that regulatory decisions in financial markets often have unintended consequences which affect capital formation. The higher cost of swaps compared to futures has led to the “futurization of swaps,” in which a swap is wrapped in a future and traded as such, with lower margin requirements. This favors DCMs over SEFs, since the latter cannot trade futures and therefore cannot enter into this type of regulatory arbitrage. Many complain that this does not mitigate risk, it just redistributes it, to the detriment of sector diversification.

Didn’t see it coming

Note that I am talking about non-crypto derivatives here. Bitcoin swaps and futures tend to have a much higher margin requirement than their traditional counterparts (maintenance margin for cash-settled bitcoin futures on the CME is 40 percent vs under 3 percent for gold futures). Rather than an attempt to dissuade investors from trading crypto products, this extra caution is deemed necessary given the assets’ heightened relative volatility. Fair enough.

As the contention mentioned above shows, we need to keep an eye on regulatory decisions within** an asset class; what’s more, not just on what the regulator is doing today, but on what the unintended consequences could be.

In the LedgerX case, we can glimpse the potential evolution of a sector structure that is probably not what either the regulators or service providers hoped for.

In taking extra care with LedgerX’s clearing license, the CFTC is shining a light on the role clearinghouses will have in the crypto ecosystem. This additional scrutiny, and the hoops and hurdles that are being imposed, could lead to crypto asset clearinghouse concentration further down the line, as scrutiny and hurdles create barriers to entry and add to operating costs. More clearinghouse concentration will increase** risk rather than decrease it, by centralizing the potential for something to go very wrong. In this case, the unintended consequences could be the opposite of the original goal.

An important factor is that LedgerX plans to sell bitcoin derivatives to institutional and retail investors. That generally makes the regulators sit up even straighter in their chairs, as protecting retail investors is a political imperative. So, we can expect even more care to be taken with settlement operations.

Another consequence of the delay is to give other potential competitors a chance to catch up: ErisX and Bakkt, both with bigger backers, are also gearing up to offer physically delivered bitcoin futures. I’m not saying this is the intention, it’s more likely to be another “unintended consequence,” but a greater choice for investors lowers risk overall.

The end game

In a fit of frustration, the CEO of LedgerX, Paul Chou, threatened to sue the CFTC over their handling of the approval. While it is generally not a good idea to be anywhere near Twitter when angry, attempting to sue the CFTC has precedent. In 2013, Bloomberg did just that over the “unfair” additional margin requirements for financial swaps vs futures that I mentioned earlier, which it saw as detrimental to the profit of its SEF. A court later threw out the suit.

I’m neither a lawyer nor a regulator, but it’s likely that the result would be the same should LedgerX press ahead with its stated intention. It would have a hard time arguing – as Bloomberg did – that the CFTC is favoring one product over another, thus putting its business model in jeopardy. The firm already trades swaps for institutional investors. The delay is affecting its intention to broaden its offering to include futures and options, and its target market to include retail investors.

It cannot even argue that the CFTC is anti-crypto. Outgoing Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has long been a thoughtful and informed advocate of innovation and blockchain technology’s potential.

It’s likely that tempers will calm and the fuss will blow over. The eventual launch of physically delivered bitcoin futures, whoever is first to market, will add a layer of maturity to a rapidly evolving sector by offering an alternative hedging mechanism in a format the market has been waiting for. That, plus the lessons learned along the way, will push the sector forward.

Meanwhile, we should all keep an eye on regulators’ actions – not on the obvious reasons, but on potential consequences and hidden messages. What they mask is often revealing.

“Banking the unbanked” has become something of a cliché in blockchain circles. It brings to mind long queues of Kenyan farmers, migrant workers with no address, or struggling families with their savings in their mattresses. The last place one expects to find ‘the unbanked’ is in the heart of global finance – New York City.

But even in the world’s banking capital, there are still thousands of people cut off from the banking system. “[A] n estimated 825,000 adults in New York City lack even a basic checking account,” according to a 2015 report by the New York City Comptroller. “In some neighborhoods like Mott Haven and Melrose in the Bronx, over half of all residents are classified as ‘unbanked.'”

However, some crypto users are using blockchain technology to provide alternatives to the legacy financial system.

Carlos Acevedo is a high school English teacher in the South Bronx. Alongside his full-time day job, Acevedo has launched the Crypto Community Project (CCP). It’s a grassroots initiative to connect young people in his neighborhood to those within the crypto community, so they can learn first-hand about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

In early August, Acevedo staged a two-day workshop for twelve of his alumni students. He arranged for industry specialists from firms such as the Electric Coin Company (behind Zcash), Gemini, the Casa wallet, and the Flexa payment network to come and talk to the students about their areas of expertise.

So why is Acevedo doing this? Crypto Briefing had the opportunity to speak to him and some of his students about the CCP initiative. For him, this is about more than just spreading the good word of crypto to the next generation. In his own words:

Crypto for the Unbanked of South Bronx

South Bronx is an area where the median household income is a little over $28,000 per year, around half the state level. As with many low-income areas, there are few traditional banks, and only one branch per 20,000 people. Overall, the Bronx has the highest proportion of unbanked people in New York City.

Therefore, the financial services available for locals tend to operate outside the traditional banking system. There are companies offering check cashing, payday loans, and money remittances, but at extortionate fees.

So Acevedo’s CCP workshop provides multiple benefits to the students. First, it gives them access to an alternative financial infrastructure, as well as explaining the associated security challenges and legal implications. Second, it gives students the opportunity to consider a career in a new sector that’s hungry for talent.

One student, Emmanuel Ntiamoah, is just about to embark upon a Computer Science course at the University of Buffalo. He told Crypto Briefing how he’d come away from the CCP workshop with an understanding of how blockchain and cryptocurrency could open up new avenues. Ntiamoah is now actively considering ways he can stay connected to the crypto space throughout his studies, and is interested in learning more about the potential career opportunities in the space.

Thais Rosario also attended the workshop. She’s set to study history as an undergraduate, but says that she definitely wants to continue her journey into crypto. Thais is particularly passionate about the fact that decentralized networks create equality of opportunity among participants. So much so, she tweeted the President to tell him what she thinks:

Currency manipulation, inflation, and having a set of few people own massive amounts of money/power it is why cryptocurrencies are so dangerous. It gives power back to the people. https://t.co/vSTlnUnVQN — Thais (@Thais16388590) August 6, 2019

Tamile Burke left the workshop with an understanding of the value of cryptocurrency in managing personal finances. She says that wants to remain connected to the cryptocurrency space, and is eager to introduce the concepts to her friends and family.“The future of crypto depends on the ones who know about it now to get the word out there,” she told Crypto Briefing.

The Evolution of the Crypto Community Project

Acevedo discovered cryptocurrency back in 2014. Over time, he started to introduce the idea to his students during lunch breaks and found they had a healthy appetite for the concepts. A running joke developed: “Mr. Acevedo, when are you gonna give me a bitcoin?”

Acevedo waited until his students graduated. Once he could legally interact with them as adults, he gifted them a nominal amount of the privacy coin Zcash.

But why Zcash, and not BTC? Acevedo explained:

He summarized:

“Using a privacy-focused coin like Zcash protects against that risk.”

One of his students happened to be mentored by Washington Post journalist Heather Long. She covered the story, and from there, Acevedo was able to leverage the publicity to connect with key figures within the community. The Crypto Community Project was born, and now, Acevedo hopes to keep the momentum going.

Crypto For The Masses

The challenges of the unbanked aren’t the sole preserve of developing countries with limited banking infrastructure, or the South Bronx neighborhoods. A 2017 survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated that 6.5 percent of US households do not have any kind of a bank account, and a further 18.7 percent have a basic checking account but use other financial products and services outside of the banking system. This represents over 30 million households using services such as payday loans, check cashing, and money remittance services.

Decentralized finance opens up the opportunity of accessing an entirely new financial services infrastructure – something that could mean far more to an unbanked person than to an average middle-income Joe.

“Poverty just means a lack of money and a lack of access, nothing more,” Acevedo pointed out. “Cryptocurrency is a way of alleviating both those things. The crypto community needs to look no further than our own backyards to live up to banking the unbanked.”",2019-08-11 17:46:45+00:00,https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/how-to-launch-a-bitcoin-atm-business-4421.htm,"Compilation of Bitcoin ATM pictures, posted by Reddit users.

The Bitcoin ATM market is “mooning.” When the first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, Canada in 2013, Bitcoin was still a largely unknown phenomenon. Fast forward to 2019, Bitcoin and Bitcoin ATMs are seemingly everywhere.

Today, there are over 5,000 Bitcoin ATMs across the globe, according to Coin ATM Radar. From New York to Hong Kong, Moscow to London, and Buenos Aires to Sydney, you will find Bitcoin ATMs. Even the small African nation of Djibouti is home to a Bitcoin teller machine. The more bitcoin awareness and adoption grows, the more entrepreneurs are installing Bitcoin ATMs in an attempt to benefit from the ”bitcoin gold rush.”

The chart below shows net change of cryptocurrency machines number installed and removed monthly:

Source: Coin ATM Radar

In this guide, you will learn how you can launch a Bitcoin ATM business to jump onto this business opportunity, which is still risky as any other business idea.

Review regulations and laws

First and foremost, you will need to check what the legal and regulatory situation is in the country or state you want to run your operation. The legal framework for operating a bitcoin teller machine can differ significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and not complying with laws when it comes to cryptocurrencies is a surefire way to suffer serious legal consequences.

Therefore, it is highly advisable to consult with a lawyer before launching a bitcoin business to ensure you will not end up on the wrong end of the law.

Find Bitcoin-friendly banking partners

Regardless of whether the Bitcoin ATMs you will install are one-way or two-way, you will need to handle cash as part of your day-to-day business operations. Therefore, you will need a business bank account at a bank that is willing to provide its services to a bitcoin business.

Due to the threat that Bitcoin poses to the legacy banking systems, the majority of banks have been reluctant to bank Bitcoin startups. However, in most countries, you should be able to find a lender or a mobile-only banking provider that is willing to open an account for you.

To play it safe, it would be advisable to set up more than one banking relationship due to the ever-changing regulatory landscape and to have a backup in case one institution changes its policy about servicing Bitcoin businesses.

The setup costs

The setup costs for a Bitcoin ATM business can vary greatly, depending on what types and how many ATMs you decide to purchase to launch your venture.

The prices of Bitcoin ATM range from USD 775 for a BitTeller BTM to USD 14,500 for a two-way Genesis Coin Genesis1 model. Delivery costs, installation costs, taxes, and import duties also need to be included in the setup costs as well as potential upfront rental charges for your chosen Bitcoin ATM location(s).

Exchange integration is another important aspect of setting up a Bitcoin ATM (unless you want to use your own company/personal cryptocurrency wallets). However, exchanges generally do not charge an upfront fee as they receive execution fees on each trade.

The purchase price of the machine(s) will be the largest portion of the setup costs while the remaining expenditure will range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand. Marketing expenses should also be taken into consideration as you will need to attract users to your ATM.

Provided you choose one of the more affordable Bitcoin ATM models, your set-up costs could be as low as USD 5,000. On the high end, you could look at USD 20,000 to USD 25,000.

Day-to-day management

The day-to-day management of a Bitcoin ATM business involves providing customer service to users who are having issues with the machine, doing cash runs to either restock the machine or to bring cash to the bank, ensuring everything runs smoothly with the exchange integration, prices feeds remain operational, and that the machine is running without glitches.

A Bitcoin ATM business is, therefore, not one that can easily be run remotely. Either you or a trusted staff member will need to be on the ground to check on the machine(s), conduct maintenance if/when necessary, and conduct the cash management.

How much can you expect to earn?

The amount of profit you can generate per Bitcoin ATM will depend on factors such as the location, public interest, the level of customer support, the machine’s availability, and whether bitcoin is in bull or bear market.

To get an idea of how much you can expect to earn, you can use the CoinATMRadar Bitcoin ATM ROI Calculator. The calculator enables you to input your known business costs, the ATM specifications, and your expected transaction volumes to compute an estimated ROI (Return on Investment) per machine.

Let’s assume you purchase a General Bytes BATMTwo Classic for USD 3,249, and you expect your machine to process 300 transactions with an average transaction volume of USD 250 per month. You charge a 7% transaction fee, and the linked exchange charges a 0.2% trade execution fee. Finally, you pay USD 250 a month rental cost for the location of the ATM (in a café, restaurant or a shop, for example) and you had one-off costs to start the business of USD 2,500.

In this instance, you would generate USD 5,250 in revenue per month, which would equate to USD 4,850 in monthly profits and a payback period of only one month.

This example shows that Bitcoin ATM businesses can be highly profitable if the right location is found, and enough users can be attracted. While this is only a theoretical example, the above returns mirror anecdotal evidence of Bitcoin ATM profitability found online.

If you have the funds to launch such a venture and are located in a bitcoin-friendly jurisdiction, a Bitcoin ATM business may be an excellent entrance into the Bitcoin economy for entrepreneurs who are willing to take risks and, as a result, potentially receive a high monetary payoff. However, as with every business, there can be no guarantees.

Companies will also be able to deduct income taxes using current PAYE (pay as you earn) frameworks under the Income Tax Act 2007.

The country’s Inland Revenue Department (IRD) published a bulletin (dated August 7, 2019) stating that the ruling was made under the Tax Administration Act 1994. (If you’re not up to speed on your New Zealand tax acts, the 1994 act typically governs the responsibilities of different government departments in relation to taxation.)

There are a few caveats, though.

For one, companies can only pay cryptocurrency to employees working under official employment agreements. Payments also have to be for a fixed amount – “the value of the crypto-asset is pegged to one or more fiat currencies.”

The ruling also states that cryptocurrency-based salary payments must also be able to be “converted directly into fiat currency (on an exchange).” According to the bulletin, salaries must be paid in a crypto-asset that functions like a currency.

In other words, the primary function of the coin must be as a replacement for fiat – this should prevent companies from paying employees in illiquid or otherwise small-time altcoins.

It should also be noted that the ruling applies only to salaried wage earners. Self-employed workers will not be able to take advantage, which is sort of a bummer.

In today’s gig economy, getting paid in cryptocurrency can be a useful tool if you don’t live in a country that accepts the currency you get paid in. In some cases, it can help circumnavigate expensive cross border payment expenses, too.

All things considered, the only reason I see for the Kiwi IRD issuing this update is to allow the taxation of companies that might already be paying staff in Bitcoin, and otherwise avoiding paying the relevant taxes. Meaning, more tax dollars for the authorities.

In reality, it’s probably not a great idea from the employee’s point of view. Sure, your salary might be a fixed fiat amount, but that doesn’t stop the cryptocurrency you’re paid in from fluctuating wildly in price.

It would be quite disappointing to get paid, and 24 hours later see the value of your salary decrease due to market fluctuations. All because you didn’t cash out immediately after getting paid. All that extra hassle, and for what?

The ruling was officially signed by New Zealand‘s director of public rulings, Susan Price on June 27, 2019. It will go into effect for a three-year period beginning on September 1, 2019.",2019-08-12,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-zealand-rules-receiving-income-in-bitcoin-is-legal-taxable,"New Zealand's tax authorities have ruled that income in cryptocurrencies is legal and provided guidance on how exactly it should be taxed.

In a tax information bulletin published on July 4, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department summarized the provisions of the public ruling, made under s 91D of the country's Tax Administration Act 1994.

Crypto used must be “money-like” to be taxed

Specifically, the guidance on the income tax treatment of crypto assets applies to payments in crypto that form part of the employees’ regular salary and are fixed at a predetermined amount or rate — rather than, for example, payments that form part of an employee share scheme.

Moreover, it applies only to salary and wage earners — not to self-employed taxpayers — covering both remuneration for services and bonuses, commissions and gratuities.

For a crypto asset-denominated salary to be taxable, the ruling determines that the crypto asset paid to employees must not be subject to a lock-up period and must be directly convertible into fiat currency, clarifying that:

“In the current environment where crypto-assets are not readily accepted as payment for goods and services, the Commissioner’s view is that crypto-assets that cannot be converted directly into fiat currency on an exchange [...] are not sufficiently ‘money like’ to be considered salary or wages.”

“Money-like” crypto assets are further defined as those that provide a general peer-to-peer payment system, rather than assets that function in a similar way to vouchers, shares or debt securities.

Thus for the wage to be taxable, the agency deems that a significant purpose of the crypto asset in question must be that it functions as a currency, or is otherwise to be pegged to one (or more) fiat currencies.

Tightening the noose

As reported, tax authorities and lawmakers globally are increasingly turning their attention to cryptocurrencies — both clarifying which provisions they fall under and attempting to tighten their grip on evasion.

Last week, crypto industry sources claimed that the United Kingdom’s tax authority was allegedly requesting that digital currency exchanges provide it with information about customers’ names and transactions aiming to identify cases of tax evasion.",,https://www.coindesk.com/new-zealand-tax-office-makes-it-legal-to-pay-salaries-in-crypto,"New Zealand’s tax office, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), has made it legal to receive salaries in cryptocurrency, and be taxed accordingly.

In its August bulletin, the agency published a new ruling under the Income Tax Act (in relation to section RD 3) that states that an employee can be paid salaries in crypto assets as long as the payments are for services performed under an employment contract, are for a fixed amount and form a regular part of the employee’s remuneration.

The crypto asset being paid must also be able to be exchanged for fiat currency, and must have the primary purpose of acting like a currency or be pegged to the price of one or more fiat currencies, the IRD states.

Crypto assets are provided as shares for income tax purposes and are received under an employee share scheme, the ruling does not apply.

As far as tax goes, salaries paid in crypto assets will be treated as PAYE (pay as you earn) income payments. These are deducted by the employer and passed onto the tax department.

The new ruling – signed on June 27 by the agency’s director of public rulings, Susan Price – will apply for three years from Sept. 1, 2019.

Previously under New Zealand law, salaries were only payable in “money,” effectively the New Zealand dollar.

In a series of slides prepared by a technical analysis team and sent out to some institutional clients, Goldman included one that said the short-term target for bitcoin (BTC) is $13,971 and that investors should consider buying on any dips in the current scenario.

The investment bank said that, based on its Elliott Wave analysis, BTC would find support around $11,094, and that there’s scope for a move higher to $12,916, then $13,971.

“Any such retracement from $12,916-$13,971 should be viewed as an opportunity to buy on weakness as long as it doesn’t retrace further than the $9,084 low,” the slide said.

It should be noted that the prices used for the analysis don’t include weekend prices and are likely from futures market data.

While this technical analysis seems bullish on bitcoin, Goldman Sachs’ former CEO and chairman has previously said bitcoin just isn’t his thing. Lloyd Blankfein said in an interview last June that bitcoin is “not for me … I don’t do it. I don’t own bitcoin.” (He retired at the end of last year.)

Rumors that Goldman would launch a crypto trading desk and custody service have been reportedly put on hold over the uncertain regulatory scene in the U.S.

According to customers, Coinbase UK is sending letters out warning people that they will need to convert their zcash (ZEC) holdings, or remove them to an external wallet, by Aug. 26.

The cryptocurrency exchange gave no specific reason for the removal of the cryptocurrency, but said all remaining ZEC balances on Aug. 26 will be automatically converted to British pounds in users accounts.

The Electric Coin Company, developer of zcash, appeared to confirm the news, saying in a tweet on Friday:

“Those affected by @coinbase UK issues: this is limited to Coinbase UK only. UK residents can still buy/sell Zcash through @cex_io. No other exchanges in the UK affected.”

It further said “To pre-empt speculation, we confirm that Zcash is 100 percent compatible with UK regulations & KYC/AML requirements.”

In its guidance released at the end of July, the U.K.’s financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, said that while some forms of crypto assets may fall under its regulatory remit, “exchange tokens” such as bitcoin and ether do not. That category would appear to include zcash.

The British tax agency, HM Revenue & Customs, has recently been sending out letters demanding that cryptocurrency exchanges – including Coinbase, eToro and CEX.IO – reveal customers’ names and transaction histories in a bid to claw back unpaid taxes, industry sources told CoinDesk.

Zcash allows users the option to hide (or shield) details of their transactions using a type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs.

When Coinbase Pro announced zcash support back in November 2018, it said that it would “support deposits from both transparent and shielded addresses, but only support withdrawals to transparent addresses. In the future, we’ll explore support for withdrawals to shielded addresses in locations where it complies with local laws.”

Users of Coinbase in other jurisdictions appear unaffected by the removal of zcash support at press time.

Blockroots co-founder and technical analyst Josh Rager believes that the best way to accumulate Bitcoin is to utilize margin trading and trade altcoin – bitcoin pairs when the digital asset is trading sideways.

Now is the Time to Accumulate Bitcoin

Popular crypto-analyst and Blockroots co-founder Josh Rager recently posted a Twitter thread detailing how to accumulate BTC. Rager compares margin trading versus altcoin trading and suggests that “Both of these strategies can be used to accumulate more Bitcoin.”

According to Rager, use of low leverage margin trading is best applied when the crypto-market as a whole is in a downtrend or when BTC is steadily outperforming altcoins. Rager suggested that minimal leverage like 5x to 3x on Kraken can be applied when “Bitcoin pullbacks in a macro uptrend, especially when alts make new lows vs BTC”.

Alternatively, the strategy of “flipping alts” can also be implemented when the leading crypto consolidates and trades sideways for a prolonged period of time.

When Bitcoin Consolidates, Altcoins Find Support

First, one would need to confirm that Bitcoin is trading within a defined range, then watch various altcoins to determine whether they are finding support. Rager then suggests that “buying at confirmed support with a stop-loss below” is a fantastic way to accumulate BTC on altcoin-to-bitcoin pairings.

Savvy investors will note that altcoins have taken an absolute pummelling since BTC began its parabolic rally from $4,000 to $13,800. Furthermore, as Bitcoin topped out at $13,800 and sharply corrected as low as $9,100, altcoins took another beating and many are now at or even below their 2017 lows.

Throughout the ramp-up to $13,800, Bitcoin dominance rose as high as 70% and currently sits at 68.8%. Therefore, investing in altcoins at this point is extremely risky as they could continue to depreciate if BTC rallies or corrects.

HODL is the Safest Path to Riches

Rager appears to acknowledge this and admits that he prefers to utilize minimal leverage “in this current market until altcoins show to outperform Bitcoin.” The analyst also suggests that simply buying and holding Bitcoin could be the most sensible option for traders who are wary of altcoins and not confident enough to trade with margin.

Hodling BTC has proven to be one of the most effective trading strategies as demonstrated by a fairly blunt tweet by Rhythm last week:

Cryptocurrency, however, which is invariably linked to the blockchain discussion, aims to drag us down.To illustrate, consider the following facts, figures, predictions, and statistics in the 2019 Cybersecurity Almanac, co-published by Cisco and Cybersecurity Ventures:

Read More: Retail’s Future Lies in Robotic Process Automation

Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the global blockchain market will exceed $40 billion by 2025.

Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that by 2021 more than 70 percent of all cryptocurrency transactions annually will be for illegal activity, up from current estimates ranging anywhere from 20 percent (of the 5 major cryptocurrencies) to nearly 50 percent (of Bitcoin) in 2017.

Around $76 billion of illegal activity per year involves bitcoin, which is close to the scale of the U.S. and European markets for illegal drugs, according to a study published by the University of Sydney in Australia, ranked as one of the top 100 universities globally.

Crypto crime is an emerging segment of the cybercrime ecosystem. One report estimates that hacks on cryptocurrency exchanges suffered roughly $1 billion in losses during 2018.

The 5 biggest bitcoin hacks of all time — with the exchange name, amount stolen, and year occurred — according to CoinSutra: Mt. Gox, 2609 BTC | +750,000 BTC (2011); BitFloor, 24,000 BTC (2012); Poloniex, 12.3 percent of all BTCs – 97 BTC (2014); BitStamp, 19,000 BTC (2015); Bitfinex, 120,000 BTC (2016).

The cost of the 2018 Coincheck hack, the biggest cryptocurrency heist to date, was $530 million. 523 million NEM coins (known as XEM) had been stolen from a hot wallet (a wallet connected to the Internet) allowing hackers to drain the coins into a separate account. The cost of those stolen coins has since declined dramatically.

Cryptojacking was one of the fastest-growing cybersecurity threats in 2018, with 25 percent of all businesses already falling victim to it.

A report from the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA) indicates a massive 459 percent increase in the rate of crypto-jacking, through which hackers hijack computer processing power to mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Monero.

Cryptojacking participants can use more sophisticated means to evade detection and according to one study, only around 50 percent of malicious attacks are detected.

On average, most crypto jackers don’t earn much. 1 out of every 500 of the top million Alexa-ranked sites hosts crypto-jacking code. The ten most profitable crypto mining sites identified generate between $119 to $340 per day, according to academics at the Braunschweig University of Technology in Germany. It remains to be seen how many crypto jackers will revert to ransomware, and data theft and resale on the Dark Web for higher payouts.

SIM swapping attacks have stolen tens-of-millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. The compromise involves tricking a mobile carrier employee into rerouting a subscriber’s phone number to a hacker’s SIM card. This enables the perpetrator to intercept the victim’s messages — including 2FA codes, which helps locate the private keys used to access a cryptocurrency account. The first hacker convicted of SIM swapping was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

The statistical information for each of these data points is attributed to various sources in the 2019 Cybersecurity Almanac.

Developed by Kakao’s blockchain affiliate GroundX, Klip will be a digital wallet that manages user information and digital assets. Specifically, it will support Klay, the native token of the firm’s Klayton blockchain, and related tokens based on its KRC-20 standard.

The firm suggests that listed digital assets will be able to be sent to users’ contacts in KakaoTalk in real-time, as with its Kakao Pay product.

Klayton went live on its mainnet on June 27, with GoundX saying it boasts fast response times on the level of legacy web services.

The Klip teaser page also shows a number of logos from early decentralized app (dapp) partner services such as Hintchain, a food recommendation project. Kakao said users can hold and manage cryptocurrencies given as rewards for using these dapps in the Klip wallet.

The storage and trading of other digital assets will be added in the future, Kakao said. These will include including Klay-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or crypto-collectibles. Items acquired in Klay-friendly blockchain games will be created as NFTs and will be able to be stored in Klip or exchanged with other users.

GroundX announced last month that a number of blockchain games will use Klay tokens including Klayton Knights (Biscuit Labs), Marvel Clans (Mix Marble) and ExiInfinity (SkyMavis).

In an echo of Facebook’s Libra project, Kakao also said that it will be possible to use Klip through KakaoTalk without installing other apps, such as Kakao Page, Kakao Friends Shop and Kakao Game.

Kakao said it aims to improve accessibility by making Klips available directly from the KakaoTalk ‘More’ tab.

The firm added that it aims to boost adoption of blockchain technology by letting its 50 million KakaoTalk users organically encounter Klayton-based services through Klips.

Now, one analyst is noting that Ethereum’s decline against Bitcoin may signal that further weakness is imminent in the altcoin markets, meaning that embattled investors may face even further losses in the near-future.

Ethereum Faces Continuous Decline Against Bitcoin as BTC Dominates Markets

Through the course of Bitcoin’s recent bull run, it has incurred a significant increase in dominance over the aggregated crypto markets, which has come about as a result of investors fleeing major altcoins in favor of BTC.

Ethereum has been one such major altcoin that has lost its dominance and has faced a steep sell off, with its price against Bitcoin plummeting from its year-to-date highs of 0.041 BTC to its current price of 0.01863 BTC.

David Martin, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, spoke about ETH underperforming BTC in a recent tweet, explaining that it is emblematic of Bitcoin’s current strength and Ethereum’s present weakness.

“#ETHEREUM continues to underperform #bitcoin, and the standard deviation of the residual spread between the pair of assets continues to widen, indicating further drift between bitcoin’s strength and ethereum’s weakness in price as of late,” he explained.

Altcoins Plummet Throughout July Despite BTC’s Stability

The weakness of altcoins against Bitcoin can be seen clearly when looking towards their July price action, as the month was a volatile one for BTC.

Although BTC only dropped a mere 6.8% in July, many altcoins dropped an average of 20%, with some plummeting more than 33%.

“For the month of July, #bitcoin was down 6.8% while the top #Altcoins were down around 20%. Most alts had > 33% drawdown in July,” Martin further explained in a later tweet.

Although it currently remains unclear as to whether or not Bitcoin will be able to continue climbing higher in the near-future, it is critical that it begins surrendering some of its market dominance, or else altcoins like Ethereum could face even further selling pressure in the coming days, weeks, and months.

New Zealand will legally allow companies to pay salaries in cryptocurrency starting September 1, becoming the first nation to do so, according to a Financial Times report.

The country requires the preferred cryptocurrency to be pegged to a standard currency and directly convertible into a normal form of payment. This stipulation allows bitcoin to replace the New Zealand dollar on workers' paychecks.

Companies paying workers in cryptocurrency can deduct income tax through the country's pay-as-you-earn plan.

New Zealand has become the first country to legalize cryptocurrency salaries, according to a report Monday from the Financial Times.

The country's tax agency ruled salaries and wages may be paid in cryptocurrencies so long as the preferred digital coin is pegged to at least one standard, or fiat, currency. New Zealand also requires that the crypto of choice be directly convertible into a standard form of payment.

This allows bitcoin — the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap — to serve as a form of payment for New Zealand workers when the law goes into effect September 1.

The decision was originally filed in an August 7 note, which also detailed New Zealand's plans to allow for bonuses to be paid in cryptocurrency. The salary option will still fall under the nation's income tax scheme, and the ruling excludes self-employed workers from switching their income to cryptocurrency.

The move brings the controversial digital asset further into the realm of everyday payment methods. Cryptocurrencies are relatively free of regulation, and their untrackable nature helped them grow popular with anonymous online purchases. The move serves as ""another step towards governments recognizing that actually people are wanting to be paid in"" cryptocurrencies, said Thomas Hulme, a solicitor at London-based law firm Mackrell Turner Garrett, to the FT.

Cryptocurrencies are also considered a novel — and volatile — investment asset. Bitcoin currently trades at a 19-month high, surging as investors flee stocks on trade-war fears. It's still down about 42% from its record high price of nearly $20,000 per coin in December 2017.

New Zealand's decision comes nearly two months after Facebook announced its own cryptocurrency, named Libra. Though the reveal stoked privacy concerns from investors and government officials alike, the tech giant's interest in digital currency added new legitimacy to the technology.

“Zoom out & think big”

In a tweet posted on Aug. 13, Mahmudov — who serves as chief information officer (CIO) at cryptocurrency hedge fund Adaptive Capital — wrote:

“At first glance this looks like a weak chop for the next week or so, but my intuition tells me there is steady accumulation happening at these levels. Don't try to outsmart yourself on short timeframes, zoom out & think big. In my view, BTC is going to $100K per orangecoin.”

Mahmudov analyzed the coin’s key support levels, observing that “200MA [moving-average] /EMA [exponential moving average]/RSIbands [relative strength indicator]+Weekly support all point to 10.8 [$ thousands) but you may get a wick at most given the orderbook support across exchanges.”

Isolating $10,800 as an emergent key support level on the BTC/USD daily chart as well, he said that — with the caveat that he is not purporting to give financial advice — “If I were a betting man, I would be patiently and slowly adding at every key support.”

To the sky

Mahmudov’s eye-popping $100,000 forecast has been recently echoed by Morgan Creek Digital Assets founder Anthony Pompliano, who considers that the recent dovish turn by central banks will be rocket fuel for Bitcoin’s price and help drive it to $100,000 by the end of 2021.

Pompliano also cited bitcoin’s halving — the reduction of mining rewards in half in May 2020 — as a major factor likely to propel the coin’s valuation upwards.

This July, Cointelegraph reported that United States-based regulated crypto derivatives and clearing platform LedgerX was giving retail investors the chance to bet on Bitcoin hitting $100,000 by 2020.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading in the $11,200-300 range, fractionally down on the day, according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index.",,https://www.coindesk.com/barclays-is-no-longer-banking-coinbase,"The most prestigious banking relationship in crypto has ended.

Barclays, the London-based global bank, is no longer working with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, industry sources told CoinDesk. And while Coinbase found a replacement in U.K. upstart ClearBank, according to people familiar with the situation, the change has indirectly inconvenienced the exchange’s users.

That’s because, aside from the cachet of working with a household-name bank, Barclays connected San Francisco-based Coinbase to the U.K. Faster Payments Scheme (FPS), enabling users to instantly withdraw and deposit British pounds at the exchange. The end of the relationship disrupted Coinbase’s access to FPS – which in turn slowed deposits and withdrawals in GBP for U.K. customers, which now take days to process.

The situation is temporary, though, thanks to Coinbase’s new relationship with ClearBank. One of the U.K. “challenger banks” that have sprouted up in recent years to compete with market incumbents, ClearBank is expected to restore Coinbase’s FPS access by the end of the third quarter.

Barclays, ClearBank and Coinbase all declined to comment.

Cold feet

Companies that handle cryptocurrency have a tough time getting banking partners, with almost all big-name banks eschewing that business.

Hence, when Coinbase obtained a bank account with Barclays in early 2018, the news was greeted with some fanfare. The exchange was also granted an e-money license by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and was the first crypto firm to gain access to FPS.

Since then, word on the street is that Barclays got cold feet about crypto clients; people have varying opinions on why this might be the case, but nobody knows for sure.

“It is my understanding that Barclays’ risk appetite has contracted a little – I’m not sure exactly why or what’s been driving that, maybe there has been some activity they are not happy with. But it’s about Barclays’ comfort level with crypto as a whole,” said the CEO of a U.K. crypto company who chose to remain nameless.

Another source described the Coinbase-Barclays relationship as a pilot program that has simply run its course.

This source added that being banked by Barclays had probably held Coinbase back in terms of which coins and tokens the exchange wanted to list, and the time taken before the bank could feel comfortable with new assets being added.

‘Zero’ tolerance

That’s not to say ClearBank is giving Coinbase carte blanche.

Earlier this week, Coinbase de-listed zcash, the privacy-centric cryptocurrency, which uses a technology called zero-knowledge proofs to mask details of transactions from blockchain watchers. A person familiar with the decision said it was “completely to do with the new bank”; ClearBank was uncomfortable indirectly supporting a currency with features that make law enforcement’s job harder.

Coinbase was not the only crypto company to successfully woo Barclays. In 2016, when the bank was perhaps more enthusiastic about the technology, Barclays said it was working with Circle Internet Financial, whose main offering at the time was Circle Pay, an FCA-regulated app that used bitcoin to help facilitate no-fee currency transfers. Customer deposits were held by Barclays.

Barclays said at that time: “We can confirm that Barclays Corporate Banking has been chosen as a financial partner by Circle, and we support the exploration of positive uses of blockchain that can benefit consumers and society.”

Both Barclays and Circle (which has since shifted its focus from retail payments to crypto trading) declined to comment on the status of their relationship.

In addition to working with Barclays, Coinbase has had a banking relationship with Estonia-based LHV Bank for a number of years. LHV has been working to offer access to Faster Payments in the U.K. but, according to industry sources, this might still be a ways off.

A spokeswoman for LHV told CoinDesk: “We have technically joined the Faster Payments scheme, but there are still some issues we have to work on and legal details to manage before we can start offering Faster Payments to our fintech clients.”

Other on-ramps

Elsewhere in the U.K., FCA-regulated crypto broker BCB Group is also working with ClearBank. The broker recently announced a deal to bring Luxembourg-based exchange BitStamp onto Faster Payments for GBP.

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, BCB’s founder and CEO, told CoinDesk: “All our clients’ GBP funds clear within 60 seconds both ways via FPS; Bitstamp is likely to be set up internally to pass that benefit on to their GBP customers (by processing payment information as fast as they receive it).”

Another popular route into Faster Payments is via FCA-regulated Enumis, which recently began working with Coinfloor, the U.K.’s longest running exchange, to broker banking relationships for crypto companies.

Also acting as an Enumis intermediary is U.K.-based Cashaa, which is helping to get banking and FPS access to projects on Binance Chain, the blockchain created by the world’s largest crypto exchange.

Despite its de-risking of crypto, Barclays still offers operational banking services to Blockchain, the U.K. wallet provider which recently announced plans to move into the exchange space with its super-fast PIT trading service.

Blockchain did not say by press time if its Barclays account was the means by which the firm would bring Faster Payments to its new exchange business.

Called Blade, the exchange platform is planning to go live in a few weeks with a focus on perpetual swaps, TechCrunch reported Monday.

The firm was founded by Jeff Byun and Henry Lee, who had previously launched a delivery startup that crypto-friendly payments firm Square acquired in part in 2017. The two have now brought some of the same investors in to back their new Blade venture.

Aside from Coinbase, investors in the $4.3 million seed round included SV Angel, A.Capital, Slow Ventures, Twitch.tv co-founder Justin Kan and Quora co-founder Adam D’Angelo.

Blade is taking a focus on perpetuals – a derivative product like a futures contract, but has no expiry or settlement date – because they are “arguably the fastest growing segment of cryptocurrency trading,” Byun told TechCrunch.

As well as allowing traders to take a position on the future value of cryptocurrencies against the U.S. dollar, swaps can be used to make bets on the price on one cryptocurrency against another.

Blade hopes to compete against other similar offerings from rival exchanges by offering simple contracts. It’s also offering margin and settlement in the stablecoin tether (USDT), as well as leverage as high as 150x on BTC/USD and BTC/KRW.

As the Korean won pair suggests, Blade is targeting the keen crypto trading markets in Asia. U.S. investors will not be allowed to use the platform, due to local regulatory issues.

Byun told TechCrunch:

“It’s kind of a bifurcated market. Either you have exchanges like Coinbase or Gemini or Bitrex that cater to the U.S. market that are highly regulated or the exchanges that cater to the non-U.S. market that are much less regulated, but that’s where most of the volume is.”

Privacy coins provide a discreet alternative to Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies. By hiding the details of your transactions, they ensure that nobody can see how much crypto you’ve transacted – or, at least, that nobody can see where you’ve sent your crypto.

The end result is that, when all goes according to plan, your crypto transactions can’t be tracked or analyzed.

Who cares? Well… lots of people. Obviously some of them are probably bad guys, and some are trying to evade taxes. The world is not a perfect place, and people will always game the system, whether with crypto or cash.

But most people who use privacy coins have much more serious reasons. Political dissidence is one – when transactions can be tracked, users’ behavior can be monitored. Free speech may seem to be a human right, but not every government agrees. Eric Wall of the Human Rights Foundation has written a series on privacy coins and their defense against authoritarianism in a surveillance society.

But companies like Chainalysis can track down many assets, which some people feel is an invasion of their right to transact anonymously.

However, you don’t need a full privacy coin to protect your transaction history: several cryptocurrencies have optional features for limited privacy. Usually, this comes with a trade off: mandatory features may provide better resistance against tracking, but optional privacy features allow for faster and lighter transactions.

Here’s how some leading cryptocurrencies approach the issue of optional privacy:

Monero Provides Mandatory Privacy, For the Most Part

Mandatory privacy is Monero’s selling point. Every Monero transaction is private, although you can share your view key if you really want to share your transaction with the world.

Riccardo Spagni, one of Monero’s lead developers, has argued the benefits of this approach: he says that “Monero’s edge will always be mandatory opt-out privacy [sic]” because it gives Monero a large anonymity set. In other words, you’ll have to make a special effort to opt out of privacy features.

Their privacy scheme conceals the receiver’s address through techniques such as Stealth Addresses, and sender and transaction amounts through RingCT’s. Stealth addresses have always been mandatory, but RingCTs have only been mandatory since 2017. This timeline may have introduced some minor tracing possibilities, as discussed here.

Zcash Offers Optional Privacy, But Default Privacy Is On the Way

Zcash is another popular privacy coin, and it has optional shielding features. These features aren’t very widely used: at any given time, roughly 5-25% of Zcash’s transactions are shielded.

Zcash’s Zooko Wilcox has suggested that Zcash will have “default on, ubiquitous privacy” in the future. Similarly, the Zcash Foundation has considered making shielding mandatory—but this isn’t happening quickly. In either case, some jurisdictions may have an issue with Zcash because of its privacy features – Coinbase in the UK just removed the ZEC token from their listings, for example.

Zcash’s shielded addresses allow transaction data to be hidden, including addresses, amounts, and memos. Shielded addresses can also interact with transparent addresses, and the particular data that any given transaction reveals depends on which addresses are involved. Some studies have suggested that this optional approach leaves Zcash open to analysis, as explained here.

Dash Offers Optional Mixing Features via PrivateSend

Dash offers an optional feature called PrivateSend, which is essentially a transaction mixer. It’s hard to say how many people use PrivateSend on the whole, but MyDashWallet’s statistics suggest that 12% of its transactions have gone through PrivateSend. It seems unlikely that Dash will ever make PrivateSend mandatory, given that it incurs extra fees and raises regulatory questions.

In practice, PrivateSend works in a fairly simple way: it mixes transactions to prevent those transactions from being traced. There is significant debate over whether PrivateSend transactions are actually untraceable, but the team itself hasn’t commented.

Furthermore, it seems that mandatory privacy isn’t the best way of resisting this, as traceability depends on the number of PrivateSend inputs.

Bitcoin Offers Optional Coin Mixing Through CoinJoin

Bitcoin offers CoinJoin as an optional privacy feature. Similar to Dash’s PrivateSend feature, CoinJoin doesn’t hide transaction data – it simply mixes transactions. CoinJoin is also fairly traceable: tools like CoinJoinSudoku allow at least some transactions to be traced, although it’s not clear how many CoinJoin transactions are actually vulnerable to analysis.

CoinJoin is the least mandatory privacy option we’ve looked at yet. Not only is it an optional feature, it’s not even an option in many Bitcoin wallets. As such, CoinJoin isn’t widely used: right now, only about 4% of Bitcoin transactions use CoinJoin. However, the actual number of transactions that benefit from it may be slightly higher, as CoinJoin has several derivatives.

Mimblewimble Does Things Differently

Mimblewimble is a relatively new privacy protocol, and it can be integrated with different coins. It doesn’t explicitly provide mandatory privacy, but Grin and Beam, the first Mimblewimble coins, are fully private. However, since Mimblewimble can also be integrated with existing coins, it could be implemented as an optional feature – though no major coins have done so yet.

Mimblewimble’s approach to privacy is unique: it doesn’t use traditional crypto addresses at all. That means Mimblewimble-based coins provide very little data that can be analyzed or traced.

Litecoin Will Offer Optional Privacy, At Least At First

Litecoin isn’t a privacy coin, but it is planning to add confidential transactions in the future. Litecoin creator Charlie Lee has stated that confidential transactions will be optional at first, but he has also said that he is in favor of a mandatory approach to privacy: “I think mandatory is much stronger privacy and fungibility but it’s harder to reach consensus on doing,” Lee stated in January.

It’s not clear what Litecoin’s privacy features will include, apart from the fact that Mimblewimble will be involved. Recent statements from Lee suggest that Litecoin’s privacy features are progressing quite slowly. For now, Litecoin is just as traceable as Bitcoin.

Incidentally, Litecoin has just been hit by a dusting attack, which could be used to trace transactions.

Will Privacy Coins Move Toward Mandatory Privacy?

The virtues of mandatory privacy and optional privacy are often debated, but the full implications are largely unproven. Naturally, most developers are concerned with more technical matters. Still, this hasn’t stopped projects from taking a stance: some projects value the benefits that come with mandatory privacy, while others value the efficiency and flexibility of optional privacy.

That said, privacy coins might begin to move toward mandatory privacy as their privacy schemes become more streamlined, lightweight, and efficient. It’s also possible that a serious threat against non-mandatory privacy schemes could speed up the transition.

In the meantime, mandatory and optional privacy will continue to be a talking point for cryptocurrency advocates throughout the space… and a potential sticking point for regulators.

Early stage investors shift focus

The “Investment in Blockchains 2019” report, which provides insight into blockchain investment and market trends in 2019, states that blockchain-focused companies have secured $23.7 billion since 2013. Increased interest among early stage investors ostensibly results from massive returns from early investments in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

Per the study, there has been a shift from focus on pure cryptocurrency investment to convergence applications in 2019. Still, artificial intelligence is on the leading position in the market, with a 33.8% stake, followed by data and ownership.

Source: Investments in Blockchains 2019 - Outlier Ventures

When it comes to early stage financing, the report states that the seed stage sees about 30 times the amounts that pre-seed raises, while Series A round produces 10 times what seed stage rounds do. At the same time, although Series A funding round reportedly constitutes only 12.8% of all funding rounds, it attracts more than 33% of all capital financing available.

The report further makes commentary on companies poorly prepared for Series B rounds:

“However, this frequency does not convert meaningfully to larger number of follow on-rounds. The mortality rate of blockchain companies are high due to challenges stemming from regulations, a lack of traction and access to investors that fund ﬁrms post series B.”

American investors dominate globally

In terms of geography, the United States dominates in regards to funded blockchain projects, seeing more investment than the United Kingdom, China and Singapore combined. San Francisco is the global leader in blockchain startup financing. London has become a hub for early stage companies looking to raise seed stage rounds, with around $1 billion raised by firms since 2013.

A May report from the International Data Corporation on global blockchain spending revealed that it will account for almost $2.9 billion in 2019, which is an 88.7% increase from 2018. The U.S. is set to see the largest blockchain spending of $1.1 billion, followed by Western Europe and China, which are predicted to invest $674 million and $319 million respectively.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-members-adopt-tougher-crypto-rules-than-aml-directive-requires/,"EU Members Adopt Tougher Crypto Rules Than AML Directive Requires

Europe is gradually tightening the rules for the crypto space. A wave of new regulations are introducing stricter requirements for companies operating in the industry and cryptocurrency users are going to feel the difference in the coming months. The measures stem from the obligation of member states to transpose EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) into national law by January. Unfortunately, they often go beyond what Brussels wants them to do.

German Regulations Chase Out Crypto Companies Like Bitpay

Germany, the flagship of the European Union, is one of the first to make the changes. New anti-money laundering (AML) regulations entering into force next year will oblige digital asset exchanges as well as providers of crypto payment and custodian services to apply for licenses from the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin). They have to do so by the end of 2019, as the new pan-European legislation is supposed to be implemented in January 2020.

Starting from next year, German financial authorities will consider digital coins a financial instrument. And while some welcome the regulatory clarity regarding the status of cryptocurrencies, others think many more aspects need clarification and even look at the new rules as an obstacle to normal business. Members of the local crypto community believe the government is actually hurting the German blockchain industry and sending crypto companies abroad.

A major industry player that evidently needs some time to think about the matter is Bitpay. The payment processor, which facilitates both crypto and fiat transactions, is not providing services to German customers anymore. About a week ago, the platform announced on its website that it doesn’t currently work with merchants or users based in the Federal Republic among countries such as Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Cambodia, Ecuador, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Nepal, and Vietnam.

The list of supported markets is regularly updated according to Bitpay’s evaluation and understanding of local laws. And the company says it engages with local authorities to fully understand the rules in order to retain compliance and offer businesses the opportunity to accept blockchain payments. But the fact that it has pulled out of Germany at this point, even if it’s only a temporary step, means that new German regulations are already making it harder for crypto companies to operate freely.

Some serious businesses, like the largest food delivery portal in Germany, Lieferando, have been offering bitcoin as a payment option to their customers through cooperation with Bitpay. Members of the country’s crypto community have been warning that the new rules are going to chase other companies out of Germany in search for a more favorable climate in different jurisdictions in Europe or elsewhere.

Prague Tightens Noose on Nascent Crypto Industry

The Bundesrepublik is not the only EU member state taking the road to much stricter standards for the crypto industry. According to reports by local media, the Czech Republic is now working on its own set of rules, further tightening the noose around cryptocurrency users. For example, failure to register with the national Trade Licensing Office will lead to massive fines for service providers in the space.

Again, these measures have been inspired by the latest European AML directive, but the country’s leading business daily wrote last week that they are going to be tougher than the requirements set forth by the EU. In an article on the subject, Hospodářské noviny recently pointed out that the new cryptocurrency regulations will increase oversight on a wider range of companies than mandated by Brussels, jeopardizing the competitiveness of the Czech crypto sector.

Estonia is another EU member that has been tuning its crypto regulations in recent months. The tiny Baltic nation was one of the first on the continent to create favorable conditions for businesses dealing with digital assets and attracted many of them to its jurisdiction. Towards the end of last year, however, regulators in Tallinn took steps to tighten the existing licensing regime. As a result, it’s going to take longer and it will be harder in the future to acquire an Estonian license.

This spring, the finance ministry presented amendments to the country’s anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing legislation. One of the changes requires Estonian companies to keep their headquarters in the country and entities incorporated abroad now have to maintain a permanent office in the republic. Estonia adopted its Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act in 2017 to transpose the provisions of the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

France Introduces Optional Licensing

Other European nations have also taken crypto regulation seriously. Earlier this year, France announced intentions to publish updated rules for the crypto industry. In April, the government in Paris adopted a bill creating the legal framework for service providers in the space and projects conducting initial coin offerings. The law introduces mandatory registration with the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) for providers of crypto custodian services as well as optional licensing for all service providers including cryptocurrency brokers, dealers and exchange operators.

About the same time, Finland enacted its law regulating crypto service providers like trading platforms, wallet providers and issuers of digital coins. The Act on Virtual Currency Providers entered into force on May 1 after it was approved by the country’s president. The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) was tasked with registering and supervising entities that fall into these categories. The new legislation and the introduction of other regulations by the FSA led to changes in the customer verification procedures applied by the peer-to-peer crypto exchange Localbitcoins.

Holland Abolishes Licensing Requirement

Obliging crypto companies to apply for licenses issued by regulators is a step too far and the case with the Dutch AMLD5 legislation demonstrates that. In early July, the Netherlands’ finance minister filed a bill in parliament implementing the directive and amending his country’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act. The draft envisaged the introduction of a licensing regime for crypto exchanges and wallet providers.

However, the unnecessary provision regarding licensing was met with a negative reaction from the Dutch Council of State, a body that advises Holland’s parliament on draft legislation prepared by the executive power and provides assessment of bills in terms of compliance with EU law. According to the council, AMLD5 does not offer a choice between licensing and registration, hence the minister’s proposal is not in line with the directive.

In its considerations, the legal portal Lexology reported, the Council of State also notes that the advice of the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) and the Financial Markets Authority (AFM) to introduce a licensing system in order to improve the effectiveness of oversight does not mean such a measure is proportionate, given the burden it imposes on service providers. As a result, the licensing requirement was abolished in the latest version of the law submitted to the Dutch parliament. There’s only a registration requirement, which is in line with EU’s directive and the Council of State’s suggestion.

AMLD5 Must Be Transposed Into National Law by January

The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive was adopted by the Council of the European Union in May 2018 and published in the official journal of the EU on June 19 last year. AMLD5 modifies AMLD4, which was released in 2015. The revision was proposed in the summer of 2016 as part of the European Commission’s Action Plan against terrorism prepared after the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and the Panama Papers scandal.

AMLD5 entered into force on July 9, 2018 and EU member states are obliged to transpose it into their legislation by Jan. 20, 2020. One of its key goals is to extend the scope of anti-money laundering laws to cover crypto exchange platforms and wallet providers. It also contains provisions regarding know your customer (KYC) rules and procedures. The implementation of the new directive is mandatory for EU countries.

In many cases, national laws transposing AMLD5 introduce regulations that are tougher than the directive requires, limiting services that have so far been readily available to the crypto community in Europe. Platforms such as Local.Bitcoin.com offer cryptocurrency users a marketplace where they are free to trade bitcoin cash (BCH) on a peer-to-peer basis and in a secure manner, without the need for KYC.

Do you need a reliable bitcoin mobile wallet to send, receive, and store your coins? Download one for free from us and then head to our Purchase Bitcoin page where you can quickly buy bitcoin with a credit card.",2019-08-13 19:25:26+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/60-latin-american-banks-can-now-use-bitcoin-for-cross-border-payments,"A leading bank technology provider in Latin America is partnering with cryptocurrency exchange Bitex to facilitate cross-border payments over the bitcoin blockchain.

“The integration of Bitex into Bantotal program represents a major step in the breakthrough of blockchain technology in banking,” said Bitex Chief Marketing Officer Manuel Beaudroit.

Bantotal is a core banking service provider based in Uruguay that services over 60 different financial institutions across 14 different countries. According to a Bantotal spokesperson, an estimated 20 million people use Bantotal’s money management services.

“Bantotal is one of the biggest banking providers in Latin America and is a huge player not just in Latin American but the greater Pacific,” said Sebastián Olivera, founder of the Uruguayan Fintech Chamber. “For me, Bitex provides a great solution for payments and they will be boosted by the structure and name of Bantotal.”

The partnership means that Bantotal clients will be able to access Bitex services in a marketplace of other traditional financial services that Bantotal offers through its BDevelopers program.

“With this technology, banks can have access to an API and have control of the whole process of [cross-border] payment with visibility and reliability on the bitcoin blockchain,” said Beaudroit.

Calling it a “quantum leap” forward for local banks in Latin America, Beaudroit said that average fees associated with cross-border payments are up to five times cheaper using Bitex than international wire transfers.

What’s more, these transfers are significantly faster, according to Beaudroit, who said payment times for exporters between Argentina and Paraguay in one instance last February dropped from one month to one hour after switching to Bitex’s cross-border payment services.

The partnership in the eyes of competitors such as Stellar, which also specializes in cross-border payments leveraging its own blockchain network, is seen as a positive signal.

Lisa Nestor, the Stellar Development Foundation’s director of partnerships, told CoinDesk:

“We think this announcement further validates the value financial institutions are recognizing in digital assets and distributed ledger technology for executing core banking activities, like international payments. It’s also no coincidence these product partnerships are being launched in the [Latin American] market where cross-border payments, even in neighboring nations, can be slow and expensive.”

How Bitex works

Bitex essentially acts as a middleman for national and regional banks to convert fiat payments into bitcoin then back into fiat, as opposed to completing multiple fiat-to-fiat conversions.

“If I want to do a payment from Argentina to Chile, I don’t need to buy dollars with the Argentinian pesos then transfer the dollars to the U.S. then move the dollars to Chile and exchange them into Chilean pesos,” said Beaudroit. “I can just send a payment from Argentina to Chile directly [using bitcoin].”

Calling it a system of “peer-to-peer banking,” Beaudroit explained that Bitex handles the conversion of local currencies into and from bitcoin, as well as, its ultimate dispersion into regional or national bank accounts.

Normally, this process of transferring money across borders with local banks in Latin American can take anywhere from 48 to 96 hours depending on the specific bank branch and financial intermediaries used, according to Leo Elduayen, vice president of non-profit Bitcoin Argentina and founder of blockchain startup Koibanx.

Elduayen described the full process of cross-border payments using Bitex as an end-to-end solution for banks, saying:

“The purchase and [transfer] of bitcoin, Bitex does it all on your behalf. You as a user just send the money and Bitex takes care of the rest for you.”

‘A good first step’

With the Bantotal partnership, Elduayen suspects that accessibility to Bitex services for consumers in Latin American will dramatically increase though there are a number of hurdles still left “to get banks on board.”

To this, Olivera said that both know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) legislation is still a major issue for banks when it comes to using the bitcoin blockchain.

Federico Ast, CEO of Buenos Aires-based arbitration startup Kleros, agreed – adding that regulatory uncertainty and seeing cryptocurrencies “as a fad” are still major barriers to entry for Latin American banks.

“I have to be honest. I think this is just the first conversation,” said Olivera. “It’s too early to say whether banks will choose to operate with Bitex but it’s a good first step.”

Rebuilding trust

At the very least, both Ast and Olivera see this partnership between Bantotal and Bitex as an opportunity to expose consumers in Latin American to the benefits of blockchain technology and help rebuild consumer trust in existing financial institutions.

“Historically, Latin America has had weak financial systems,” said Ast. “There’s a history of bank runs with some sad highlights of confiscation of people’s saving (e.g., Argentina in 2001). … This agreement will lead to lower costs for consumers and higher financial inclusion.”

Bitex’s Beaudroit has high hopes this partnership will also contributed to increasing the national GDPs of Latin American countries by enabling more commerce to flow “in a peer-to-peer fashion.”

In this way, Santiago Siri, founder of digital governance startup Democracy Earth and advisor to Bitex, said the work of Bitex went far beyond simply being a crypto exchange platform.

Said Siri:

“It’s an ideal partner for banks to use bitcoin … as a way of connecting banks in a way that is not very common in the industry yet is fundamental for markets like Latin America.”

Flexa, which launched the U.S. edition of its SPEDN cryptocurrency wallet in mid-May, announced its Canadian expansion in an official blog post. Backed by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, Flexa’s international movement is preceded by both support for cryptocurrencies litecoin and zcash and the launch of an Android beta mobile app earlier this summer.

Functioning like a pipeline for commercial transactions, SPEDN processes regular purchases in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum, bitcoin cash or native token flexacoin.

Today, SPEDN is now open to Canadians on both iOS and Android. The post claims 7,500 Canadian merchants will be on-boarded by early September.

With all funds insured and custodied by Gemini, Flexa says Canadian and U.S. users can use SPEDN in either country free of conversion fees or exchange rates issues.

Speaking with CoinDesk, Flexa co-founder Tyler Spalding said the payments processor plans on launching in a few more countries by the end of the year but cannot disclose the locations.

On-boarding additional coins is also in the works.

“Regarding the market, we anticipate considerable growth of ‘spendable cryptocurrencies’ like stable coins and loyalty coins over the next year that will drive consumer demand for spending,” Spalding said. “We are working with multiple projects and intend to launch many new coins on the network shortly. For now, we’ve been really impressed with the current communities and their repeated use of the SPEDN app, particularly litecoin.”

Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsquare partnered with Flexa for the launch.

Demand for lawyers has risen sharply, Facebook is actively hiring and the United States is breaking every record in terms of the number of job offerings. However, the overall picture is rather ambiguous.

Blockchain experts are still in demand, especially in the U.S.

According to a first quarter 2018 report, published by the world's largest freelance network, Upwork, knowledge of blockchain technology came out on top among the specialties for which demand has grown the fastest. And the statistics presented by the international recruiting company Hired showed that global demand for blockchain engineers increased by 517% over the past year.

In 2019, the trend of demand for such specialists hasn’t changed dramatically. The word “blockchain” in the labor market is still in trend — as it was fashionable in the beginning of the 21st century to attribute the word “cloud"" to job descriptions. Companies striving to be trendy publish more and more vacancies, and there are still not enough specialists in this field.

According to the latest data from the international job search site LinkedIn, the total number of vacancies related to blockchain and cryptocurrency hasn’t decreased since December 2018, but has instead increased. In total, as of the end of July 2019, companies have posted 16,668 offers, which is 2% more than last year.

The number of U.S. companies that hire blockchain specialists has grown even more. The U.S. remains the unchallenged leader in the number of such vacancies, and it is also breaking last year’s records in 2019. According to the job search website Glassdoor, as of late July, U.S. firms posted 2,907 job offerings, which is up 40% from 2018. Indeed experts confirm the increased number of blockchain job proposals, referring to an almost twofold increase:

“According to our data, the crypto and blockchain market is far from dead—in fact, it’s still rapidly growing. From February 2018 to February 2019, we saw the share of US job postings related to crypto, blockchain and Bitcoin grow 90%.”

However, if evaluating the share of these vacancies to the total number of offerings in the labor market, it occurs that the share of vacancies that contain the words ""blockchain"" and “cryptocurrency"" has dropped over the last year by 12%, as analysts from Indeed reported to Cointelegraph.

The reduction in the number of offers for blockchain specialists is also confirmed by data from such big recruitment resources as Glassdoor and AngelList, which show a decline of 11% and 18% respectively.

People began to search for blockchain jobs twice less. This trend was identified by Indeed analysts, who shared the comparative statistics with Cointelegraph. According to it, the share of the blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related job searches has declined by 52% over the last year (June 2018-June 2019).

The experts also revealed a direct correlation between Bitcoin price and the number of people looking for this kind of jobs:

“Not only did bitcoin reach an all-time high in December 2017, in February 2019 it had 37% of the value it did compared to the year before. Job seekers responded to the peak in bitcoin pricing with searches for roles related to Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain.”

Companies prefer full-time employees

The number of remote jobs in the field of blockchain technology has significantly decreased — 25 offerings in 2019 against 127 in 2019. Illuminates, a company that is developing a decentralized business relations platform, attributed a similar tendency to demands on candidates, which companies began to increase soon after the number of incompetent specialists started growing in the market. The company told Cointelegraph:

“Even in startups sectors there is decrease of remote jobs, only 29.5% vacancies has tag ‘remote.’ In our opinion this situation is related to unprofessional subcontractors with fake portfolios, problems with partnerships, co-founding relations, unfair clients promises and payments delays, and for sure the problem is always near with area of investments, bubble startups and laundering founders spendings. And it’s not some local problems, each company or founders personally have come across this at least once.”

How much do blockchain specialists earn?

Judging by the consolidated data collected by Glassdoor and Indeed, blockchain specialists have the same salary as in the previous year.

According to Glassdoor, disclosed salaries range from $17,000 all the way up to $271,000 per year. The major pay of job offerings falls within the $81,000 to $144,00 range per year (404 offerings), as TeQatlas analyzed. The salary range according to Indeed was $75,000-$90,000, with an average value of $82,500. In comparison to last year, the average salary for such employees was $84,884, as Glassdoor reported in August 2018.

As can be seen, the salary index in 2019 hasn’t been affected by declining prices or the influx of job seekers from South Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan, etc.), who offer their services on sites like Upwork for $10-20 per hour. At the same time, the highest rate on average is set by applicants from the U.S. ㅡ $100 per hour and more.

As of July 28, 2019, it is the cheapest to hire a full-stack developer from India. The job seeker offers his/her services for only $3 per hour. The highest price for freelance work in the crypto space goes to intellectual property and cryptocurrency attorneys from the U.S.: $200 per hour.

Researchers at TeqAtlas analyzed open vacancies for blockchain-related jobs for the current year. As it turned out, the highest salaries are still paid in the U.S. ($109,773 on average), a little less is received by specialists in Asia ($98,500), while the average salary of a European employee ($57,500) is 30% lower than that of an American. At the same time, job seekers from other countries may get a higher-paying job by applying for a remote vacancy.

Developer salaries are the same, while the requirements are getting stricter

The major part of the blockchain and cryptocurrency jobs market remains to be focused on developers, and this continues to be the area of most demand. The “U.S Emerging Jobs Report” published by Linkedin back in 2018 shows that demand for blockchain developers has grown 33 times over the previous year.

As of Oct. 23, 2018, the average salary for a blockchain developer was reported to be $127,000, according to Janco Associates, a consulting firm that conducts salary surveys.

Judging by statistics shared by job recruitment firm Hired, the salary for blockchain developers ranges between $67,000 and $155,000 a year, depending on the region.

In early 2019, the situation has changed little. In January, the median annual salary for blockchain developers was $132,000, with the most experienced developers earning $76,000 and upward.

However, six months later, judging by the data from ZipRecruiter as of July 22, 2019, the average annual salary for a blockchain developer in the U.S. has slightly dropped to $126,020 a year. This is 1%-5% less than in the same year. At the same time, if taking a selection of the most popular vacancies posted on the same website, it turns out that in 75% of cases, companies are willing to pay employees $136,000. And this is even more than in 2018.

However, the chance to get “the half-million dollar job,” as it was two years before, seems to be less realistic today, as the analytics show that the average pay range for a blockchain developer varies little (about $19,000). This suggests that, regardless of location, there are not many opportunities for increased pay or advancement, even with several years of experience.

In addition, analysts from Illuminates told Cointelegraph about a large influx of developers from poor regions — such as Nigeria, Pakistan, India and Kenya — who offer “extremely low prices and product quality.” This, according to experts, entails a decrease in demand for third-party developers.

Lawyers much-needed to work with regulators

The demand for legal professionals who specialize in blockchain affairs is constantly growing, and finding such employees is not easy, according to Brian Burlant, managing director of legal recruiting company Major, Lindsey & Africa.

The fact is that it is very difficult to find specialists who understand what blockchain is and how it is used, especially when it comes to the operation of cryptocurrencies. And now, when companies whose activities are related to digital money have to deal with regulators more and more often, the demand for lawyers has risen sharply.

For example, Coinbase is willing to pay up to $386,000 per year for a role named “Senior Associate General Counsel — Regulatory,” whose responsibility will be “managing the company's relationship with federal regulators, including the SEC and the CFTC.”

Many lawyers who eventually come to the blockchain industry are professionals who have worked with the legal issues of regulating distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies at the governmental level. And experts who understand how digital assets function and are regulated represent the most value.

Commenting on Burlant’s opinion on the labor opportunities for such specialists, Mary Young, partner of the Zeughauser Group, said that blockchain lawyers have become very popular since December 2017, and when many cryptocurrencies fell in price, many of such specialists quietly left the blockchain sphere for the companies they had worked for before. Similar waves of inflow and outflow of specialists were observed during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s.

Jake Chervinsky, a legal expert, pointed out that legal advocates often take pseudonyms when working on various issues. According to his tweet:

“I recently heard someone refer to the use of a pseudonym as ""sketchy."" I couldn't disagree more. Pseudonyms are often critical for safety & security and can make the difference between free speech or none at all. If these are fundamental rights, then so too is using a pseudonym.”

This can be explained by the fact that not all lawyers dealing with blockchain and cryptocurrency issues want to disclose their involvement in this kind of business, which means that it becomes harder for recruitment agencies to find them.

The more expensive Bitcoin is, the higher the salaries are

Even if you don’t get promoted, your salary can significantly increase if you get paid for your work in cryptocurrency. For example, specialists who saved their salary of $2,000 dollars in December, January and February would have increased it 3.5 times and turn $6,000 into $21,000.

The popularity of getting paid in cryptocurrency is confirmed by the statistics presented by Bitwage, which provides services to global companies for paying employees in digital currency. It’s reported to currently process $2.5 million in monthly volume for contractors and full-time employees, and the sum of money paid to employees via the service increased from $31 million in 2018 to $50 million in July 2019, according to information the company’s representatives shared with Cointelegraph.

Moreover, several blue-chip companies — including Amazon, Google and Apple — have employees that use Bitwage to automatically convert their cash salaries into cryptocurrencies. Indeed, Bitwage allows ordinary companies and specialists to resort to cryptocurrency payments absolutely legally. In the U.S., companies can even settle payroll taxes, and since January, have also been able to cover such benefits as health insurance.

Giants are hiring

Despite the instability of the crypto market, global companies see great potential in the blockchain technology itself. This year, corporations are breaking records in opening and expanding departments and hiring staff, with new vacancies being mostly related to research and development.

According to AngelList, at the moment, at least 1,500 crypto startups, which have combined raised over $3.7 billion from initial coin offerings, are looking for employees in the U.S. alone.

The most active companies moving in this direction are IBM, Cisco and Accenture — together they account for about 1,000 open vacancies.

The highest wages, whereas, are paid by the companies specializing exclusively in cryptocurrencies and blockchain.Other companies are not only growing, but also actively paying their salaries in cryptocurrency. For example, Kraken exchange claims that it paid salaries in Bitcoin to 250 of its employees in April, while there is a growing demand in getting paid in cryptocurrency:

“Kraken paid 250 salaries in bitcoin in April and more employees are opting for crypto every month.”

At the moment, Kraken has about 800 employees. So, judging by the exchange’s revelation, about 30% of them receive Bitcoin as a payment for their work. Notably, it’s not the only exchange paying in crypto. As reported by Cointelegraph on Dec. 6, 2018, crypto exchange Binance said that at least 90% of its employees were paid in the company's cryptocurrency.

An increasing amount of new blockchain jobs has been recently recorded at Facebook headquarters. On March 25, 2019, it was reported that the social media giant had posted 22 new vacancies over the past month and was actively hiring a lot of specialists for expanding its new blockchain department. These are specialties mainly connected with management and programming.

Blockchain jobs are here to stay

Well, this doesn’t mean blockchain geeks and crypto traders are coming for our jobs, but the labor market is likely to see continued growth in fields related to DLT and digital currency.

However, if the cryptocurrency market falls sharply, the amount of job searches may further decrease, as Tal Vinnik — a content strategist at Indeed Prime, a service that connects tech talent to leading brands and startups — presumes:

“For the first time, the number of jobs per million exceeded the number of searches per million. It could be reasonable to assume that if bitcoin drops dramatically again, a candidate looking for a blockchain role would run into less competition than they would after a large increase. There also does appear to be a skills shortage as enterprise projects have matured over the last three years.”

The same situation may affect the trend of getting paid in cryptocurrency. Overall, Bitcoin payments were popular at one point in time, when the market was down, but after a major rise in price, they may become far less attractive due to the risk of a major fall.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-math-fibonacci-crypto-price/,"Bitcoin was built using mathematical code, and nearly all aspects of it, from its hard-capped supply to its price, and everything in between is deeply steeped in math.

Ancient mathematics first popularized in the middle-ages may hold the key to predicting Bitcoin tops and bottoms with chilling accuracy. And according to how the number sequence has followed thus far, one crypto analyst believes it would put the top of the next Bitcoin rally at $220,000 per BTC.

Fibonacci Sequence Could Be Magical Tool For Predicting Bitcoin Tops and Bottoms

Mathematics is the study of quantity, structure, space, and change. Each of these key attributes is central to Bitcoin in some way. Quantity, would represent how many Bitcoin’s have been hard-coded to exist; structure would represent Bitcoin’s code and blockchain, space could theoretically represent chart patterns such as the symmetrical triangle the crypto asset recently broke down from; and change would be represented by price action and change in value, or potentially through Bitcoin’s regularly planned halvings.

With math so important to Bitcoin, could it also hold the key to unlocking the ability to accurately predict price tops and bottoms using a number sequence developed by a renowned mathematician from the middle-ages? One crypto analyst believes so and suggests the next target for Bitcoin’s top would be $220,000 per BTC if the sequence continues to be followed.

The analyst says that Bitcoin is “ruled by Fibonacci numbers,” and follows a “magic mathematic path.” Using Fibonacci sequence – a series of numbers where the next number can be found by adding up the two numbers before it – the analyst claims each previous cycle top and bottom has been predictable, and if the same pattern is followed, the next logical top for BTC would be at $220,000.

As for when that target is reached, the analyst doesn’t say, but does also offer up a bottom Bitcoin will reach after the top target has been reached and momentum begins to reverse. According to the theory, the next Bitcoin bottom would be at $36,000.

Fib Tools and Math Are a Crypto Trader’s Best Friend

Fibonacci sequence was popularized by and eventually named after Leonardo Bonacci, considered the “the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages” and better known as Fibonacci. His work is commonly found even today, especially when it comes to Bitcoin, crypto, and financial markets.

Traders use these tools in conjunction with other forms of mathematics, such as geometrical shapes such as triangles, squares, and circles to help, and indicators to conduct technical analysis that can help improve success rates when trading.

Given the weight that mathematics holds with Bitcoin, and how deeply rooted the first-ever crypto asset is in math, the analyst’s predictions could be proven true.

A tweet from cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay confirmed the news on Aug. 13.

Mavs’ billionaire owner is a crypto enthusiast

Cryptocurrency adoption has been on the horizon for the Mavs since early last year, when team owner and billionaire tech investor Mark Cuban hinted that fans would soon be able to use Bitcoin to buy tickets to the team’s games.

A year and a half later, Cuban’s plans have materialized and the Mavs join their NBA rivals, The Sacramento Kings, in rolling out cryptocurrency access for their fans.

The Sacramento Kings became the first NBA team to accept Bitcoin for promotional products as well as for tickets as early as 2014.

According to an excerpt from a Dallas Mavericks press release shared by industry sources on social media, the Mavs — like The Sacramento Kings — be using BitPay’s services to process their fans’ Bitcoin payments.

Cuban’s prior involvement in the crypto space includes investments in both a digital currency hedge fund and an ICO, as well as the launch of the Ethereum-based Mercury Protocol back in August 2017.

The investor has this summer voiced his opinion that Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency is a big mistake and could even be dangerous. This month, he also said he believes Bitcoin is fundamentally similar to gold from an investor’s perspective.

Driving mass cryptocurrency adoption

Sports are becoming an increasingly fertile ground for bringing blockchain and cryptocurrency to a vast audience.

Just yesterday, Cointelegraph reported that the iconic American boxer Mike Tyson is leading a new blockchain-powered cross-entertainment venture and fan token ecosystem that aims to catapult aspiring young fighters to success.

Blockchain platform Socios.com has also sealed a range of partnerships with leading international soccer teams — including French club Paris Saint-Germain, Italy’s Juventus and the United Kingdom’s West Ham United — for a series of fan token offerings.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/8/14/barclays-cuts-ties-with-us-based-crypto-exchange,"The British bank partnered with Coinbase in March of 2018, making it easier for users in the UK to buy cryptocurrencies.

Barclays is no longer providing banking services to major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. This ends a relationship that started in March last year as the exchange expanded in Europe.

The rare deal between the San Francisco-based exchange and the British bank made it easier for Coinbase users to buy cryptocurrencies with pounds and withdraw their funds.

Barclays declined to comment, while Coinbase did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The news was first reported by industry website CoinDesk on Wednesday.

Large global banks have been reluctant to do business with companies that handle bitcoin and other digital coins because of concerns that these cryptocurrencies are being used by criminals to launder money and that regulators will soon crack down on them.

Three-quarters of cryptocurrency businesses in Britain are forced to bank overseas due to the difficulty of getting banking services onshore, a survey by industry body CryptoUK reported last month.

Even crypto-related firms that don’t handle digital coins, such as web designers, typically face problems in opening bank accounts, CryptoUK chair Iqbal Gandham told Reuters. The association itself could not get an account with a major UK bank, he said.

The challenges lead to extra operational costs and often force British firms to seek accounts overseas, Iqbal said, adding that the industry was unclear on what steps it needed to take in order to get easier access to banking.

“We have got this traditional industry sitting there, and saying they are not interested,” he said. “We need to sit down and ask ‘What do they want?’ [and] ‘What are they waiting for?'”

Coinbase’s chief executive for the UK, which is its biggest European market, said in March 2018 that the deal with Barclays had taken some time to sign because the bank needed to be sure that Coinbase had the right systems in place to prevent money laundering.

Cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated in Britain and across Europe, but Coinbase is licenced to provide fiat currency-related services across 23 European Union countries. Many customers deposit fiat money – currency that a government has declared to be legal tender – at Coinbase before buying and selling cryptocurrencies.

While big banks remain reluctant to become too closely involved in the plumbing behind the global crypto market, large companies and venture capital funds are pouring money in, Reuters reported in April.",2019-08-14,https://cointelegraph.com/news/samsung-discreetly-adds-bitcoin-support-to-blockchain-keystore,"South Korean tech conglomerate Samsung has quietly added Bitcoin (BTC) support to its decentralized app store, Blockchain Keystore.

According to updated information on the Samsung Developers website, the Keystore now supports Bitcoin as well as Klaytn, the cryptocurrency released by Korean internet giant Kakao.

Select devices and jurisdictions

As the site outlines, Samsung’s Blockchain Keystore is supported by six of its devices — Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, S10 5G, Note10 and Note10+ — and across six jurisdictions: Canada, Germany, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Keystore was first released in July of this year as part of Samsung’s blockchain and decentralized application (DApp) Software Development Kit (SDK), which provides account management as well as backup, payment and digital signature facilitation.

Notably, initially the Keystore had only supported the Ethereum blockchain.

Earlier this month, Samsung had expanded SDK with two new services — an AI-powered digital analytics DApp dubbed “Jupiter” and a QR code-based peer-to-peer wallet, “Mars,” and integrated them into the Galaxy S10 and newer versions of Samsung smartphones.

Blockchain smartphones

In parallel to Samsung, Taiwanese consumer electronics giant HTC has also launched a blockchain-powered smartphone, dubbed “Exodus,” which launched in fall 2018.

In addition to the three letters sent last month to crypto traders advising them they may have incorrectly filed their taxes, the IRS is now also telling certain investors that they did, in fact, report the wrong amount of income from crypto transactions. And the agency is looking to collect.

According to one letter shared with CoinDesk, a taxpayer owed nearly $4,000 for the 2017 tax year. This taxpayer owed more than $3,600 in taxes alone, with another $200 or so in interest accrued.

The letter was dated July 29, 2019.

Chandan Lodha, co-founder of tax software provider CoinTracker, told CoinDesk that the IRS has been sending these so-called CP2000 notices to some customers, indicating they are potentially on the hook for revenue they did not report.

“The IRS is sending out these other notices and those are kind of like warning letters of varying degrees of how threatened they were,” Lodha said of the earlier three letters. But the “CP2000 is a slightly different letter.”

He went on:

“Basically what it says is ‘hey we have a report from one of the financial institutions you use and the amount they reported to us the IRS is different than the amount you, the taxpayer, reported and this is the amount you owe’ and it’s a 30-day letter meaning you have to respond in 30 days.”

The CP2000 letter has been used outside of the cryptocurrency space for other forms of unreported income, Lodha said. However, “it’s definitely a new phenomenon that’s starting” in the crypto space.

Lodha added that transfers from an exchange into another wallet shouldn’t be a taxable event, but an exchange may still report it as such.

Paper chase

Justin Woodward, a co-founder and attorney with tax calculator startup TaxBit, told CoinDesk that he’s seen more of these letters starting in August.

According to the IRS website, a recipient of the letter should respond regardless of whether they agree with the tax assessment or not. Those who disagree with the assessment should ask their financial institution to send a corrected statement.

Lodha added:

“In terms of how the actual dynamic works, first they send you the CP2000, they send the proposed amount due and you say ‘yes, I’ll pay that’ or ‘no, and here’s the supporting documentation.'”

According to the letter shared with CoinDesk, the recipient reported $0 in income from crypto transactions to the IRS in the 2017 tax year. However, information through Coinbase indicated the recipient should have reported more than $12,000 in income.

Neither the IRS nor Coinbase immediately responded to requests for comment Wednesday.

It is possible that such discrepancies come from how exchanges are reporting transactions.

Woodward said this likely comes from the exchanges issuing 1099-K forms, rather than 1099-B forms. Because 1099-K forms are typically used to report income for merchants, most transactions would be reported as revenue, rather than any losses that may have occurred.

Aaron Cohen, who received one such letter, confirmed that the IRS based its estimation of his tax burden on a 1099-K which dramatically overestimated how much he made on his trades.

“I’m not sure if it’s a lack of understanding from the IRS or if they’re just blindly sending out these letters hoping people are too scared [or] too lazy to look at the letter and say ‘hey they made $13,000’ when they didn’t make $13,000,” he said.

He worked with CoinTracker to estimate a more accurate total on capital gains, which he plans to report to the IRS, he said.

“People that have received a 1099-K from an exchange but have not filed an IRS 8949 in the 2017 tax year are the ones that we’re seeing received the most letters and who this is typically applying to right now,” Woodward said.

In such cases, “we’ve been sending letters back that outline the deficiencies in 1099-Ks … and we’ve helped [traders] and with the proper 8949,” Woodward said.

He described how filing the merchant form could lead to a trader receiving the CP2000, saying:

“The amounts on the form, what they’re doing is if I make a trade for $100,000 on a platform, I buy 1 bitcoin for $100,000 and I sell it a couple weeks later for $90,000 I could have a $10,000 loss but I have a 1099-K that says I received $90,000.”

The IRS is expected to issue new guidance on crypto taxes in the near future, updating the last official guidance issued in 2014. It is unclear what the agency might say, though outstanding questions include how to deal with hard forks and airdrops.

Alcor Life Extension Foundation has revealed the company is accepting bitcoin cash (BCH) donations. Alcor was convinced by Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman Roger Ver to add BCH acceptance, the same person who convinced Alcor to accept BTC payments via Bitpay back in 2014. The nonprofit organization is well known for its cryonics research and practices as the company has a strong relationship with cryptocurrency advocates.

Alcor Foundation Convinced to Accept Bitcoin Cash Donations

The Alcor Life Extension Foundation now accepts bitcoin cash (BCH) donations for its cryonics research and operations in Scottsdale, Arizona. Many cryptocurrency historians will recall that the early cryptocurrency pioneer Hal Finney was a believer in life extension and he is cryopreserved at Alcor. However, they might not realize that Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman and one of the industry’s first angel investors, Roger Ver, convinced Alcor in 2014 to accept BTC. At the time, the company accepted BTC through the Atlanta-based payment processor Bitpay. On August 28, 2014, when Finney passed away, his body was brought to the cryonics facility for preservation. Alcor explained that Finney’s remains would be kept in “long-term storage, where he (would be) cared for until the day when repair and revival may be possible.” Finney’s cryonics process was paid for with his life insurance and “bitcoins donated by admirers” and his wife has also chosen to be cryopreserved.

Ver has once again convinced the nonprofit to accept a cryptocurrency and this time around it’s bitcoin cash (BCH). Alcor also accepts cryptocurrency payments in ETH, LTC, and BTC. “If you don’t see your preferred cryptocurrency in the list below you can contact us and we can probably provide you with a wallet address,” Alcor’s crypto donation page details. Donations help the company remain at the forefront of cryonics technology and give the Alcor team the ability to “preserve the future for all members.” Ver also generously gave Alcor 3 BCH (more than $1,000) after the company created a bitcoin cash donation address. People who wish to donate to Alcor’s cryonics research and operations can visit the nonprofit’s cryptocurrency donation page here.

Lots of Well-Known Blockchain Technology Advocates Support the Philosophy of Extropy and Cryonics Research

Besides Hal Finney being Alcor’s 128th patient, there are a bunch of blockchain technology proponents who believe in life extension and the philosophy of extropy. Extropianism is an “evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition” and the belief is that someday humans will be able to live indefinitely through advances in science and technology. “The Principles of Extropy” started as a set of principles invoked by futurist and philosopher Max More. He’s also been the president and CEO of the Alcor Foundation since 2011.

Another member of the Alcor Foundation is the cryptocurrency magnate Robin Hanson and the world-renowned cryptographer Ralph Merkle has been known to be a “researcher and speaker of cryonics.” Years ago, Galaxy Digital founder Michael Novogratz gave money to SENS research, an organization that studies and develops regenerative medical therapies. “SENS Research Foundation works to develop, promote, and ensure widespread access to therapies that cure and prevent the diseases and disabilities of aging,” the website reads. More than $4 million dollars’ worth of digital currencies were donated to SENS from the Pineapple Fund and Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin.

Whether It’s Anti-Aging Science or Mass Crypto Adoption, Persistence Pays Off

A few cryptocurrency advocates think highly of life extension, futurism, the philosophy of extropy, and organizations like Alcor and SENS research in the same way they believe digital currencies will revolutionize the world’s monetary system. Alcor is convinced that cryonics, cryonics research, and cryonics technology will help preserve our loved ones until the technology becomes available to restore them back to good health. SENS research has also redefined age-related ill-health treatments by “inspiring the next generation of biomedical scientists.” Just like digital asset proponents, believers in life extension face skeptics of these technologies and of newly created sciences. There’s no reason to think that some day digital currencies won’t be used by the global masses, because there’s a good chance it could happen. In the same way, we cannot say that science and technology will not be able to stop or slow down aging dramatically. Nor can we say that at some point in the future we won’t be able to restore our deceased loved ones’ lives.

Alcor accepting bitcoin cash (BCH) donations is a natural fit, because both concepts derive from being optimistic on the future of math, science, and technology. Moreover, adding a variety of cryptocurrency addresses to the donation page promotes more free market choice by allowing people to donate using their preferred cryptocurrency. BCH fans will be pleased to hear that another well-known organization now accepts the peer-to-peer electronic cash. Similarly, through strong community persistence, organizations like Chess.com accept BCH for subscriptions and the Free Law Project’s Courtlistener Repository accepts BCH donations as well.

Al Jazeera shared the news in a report on Aug. 14. According to the report, the platform supports donations in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC). The government is reportedly not involved in the project.

IranRescueBit reportedly allows donors to dodge American sanctions that have insofar prohibited international donations to the Iranian Red Crescent Society, which is a non-governmental humanitarian society within Iran.

According to the report, the advantage of cryptocurrencies in this case is that no centralized authority is needed to verify the transactions due to the decentralized nature of crypto confirmations.

IranRescuebit executive director Hamed Salehi told Al Jazeera that the platform’s campaign is hoping to facilitate one month of crypto donations before using local exchanges to convert the cryptocurrencies into Iranian rials.

Once the conversion is complete, Salehi said the proceeds would be sent to a local bank account of the Iranian Red Crescent Society. Salehi commented:

""We hope that IranRescueBit can turn into a platform that could be employed either by the community or by the IRCS should the need ever arise again in the future.""

Record rainfalls in April gave way to destructive flooding that resulted in 70 deaths in 13 provinces with the highest casualties in Fars, Lorestan, Golestan and Hamedan, according to CNN.

Blockchain platforms for charity

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the South Korean holding company SK C&C recently unveiled a scheme for a blockchain-based donations platform. As per the report, the platform will allow users to make donations and in return receive incentives tokens, which can apparently be used to buy merchant items.

However, regulations and technological challenges pose barriers to an official launch. SK C&C head Lee Sun-min explained:",,,,

This week started with high hopes for a bull run. The New Zealand tax office legalized cryptocurrency salaries, and Goldman Sachs analysts advised clients to buy Bitcoin (BTC) at a relative ‘dip’ of $11,000.

Those hopes have been dashed by a significant market downturn. More than $30bn has been wiped from the market since Tuesday afternoon, and Bitcoin plummeted by nearly $1,500. Large-cap altcoins lost around 10% of their value.

As one analyst put it, “it’s been a crazy couple of days”.

Some analysts attribute the bloodbath to the looming recession, which led investors to pull out of riskier assets and into perceived safe havens. As equities fall across the board, demand for bonds has smashed records. An inverted yield curve warns that the market expects an economic slowdown.

Even though Bitcoin – which currently comprises about 70% of the total cryptocurrency market – has never been through an economic downturn, many advocates believe it could provide an attractive haven after the warning signs start flashing.

“Bitcoin is a better store of value than anything that has existed before,” tweeted Block.One CEO Brendan Bloomer, “and is on course to replace Gold as it outcompetes on economics and digital functionality.”

But this seems to be based on economic folklore rather than experience. Although Grayscale and billionaire bro Mark Cuban referred to Bitcoin as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin has little in common with precious metals. The BTC-gold correlation is very weak, and shared movements could be coincidental rather than due to shared fundamentals.

The graphs say it all. While the gold price has been on a near-uninterrupted rise over the past month, Bitcoin has risen, plateaued and spiraled back down again. If a global recession is supposed to be Bitcoin’s ‘ultimate test,’ it’s not doing very well.

But if people are selling BTC, what are they selling it for? If bitcoin is not a reliable store of value, then we should see value moving out of virtual assets. Instead, the majority of USD-denominated volume appears to be heading into the stablecoin Tether (USDT).

That suggests two things: first, that investors are responding as they usually do in crypto downturns. Buying stablecoins allows investors to preserve value, while remaining in the asset class. Second, it also betrays a degree of uncertainty. Moving into stablecoins gives investors time to formulate longer-term trading strategies. The market could be taking a pause to figure out what a global recession means. Still A Fragile Market The latest stock market plunge came at exactly the wrong time for cryptocurrency. Markets have been cooling ever since the Congressional hearing into Facebook’s cryptocurrency. With the fate of Libra in question, the main driver behind the recent rally disappeared. And, even though crypto markets have been bullish, liquidity has remained low. Binance closed for eight hours of maintenance today, making trading markets even more shallow. Bobby Ong, CoinGecko co-founder, believes that Binance’s downtime could have contributed to the latest plunge. With Binance orderbooks offline, it became “easier for traders to move the market,” Ong said, and that could explain why Bitcoin fell below $10,000. When the exchange reopened, traders took advantage of the lower price to buy on the cheap, subsequently bringing BTC back above the $10,000 mark. But while it’s premature to say BTC is a recession hedge, it’s also premature to say that it isn’t a recession hedge. As investments, cryptocurrencies have unique characteristics. They are truly global, tradeable around the clock and, in most cases, have very clearly defined rules on scarcity. Whether that will help weather the oncoming storm remains to be seen.",2019-08-15 17:04:21+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/3b-ponzi-scheme-is-now-allegedly-dumping-bitcoin-by-the-hundreds,"Amid a downturn in the cryptocurrency markets, the apparent swathe of Bitcoin sell-offs from a $3 billion Chinese Ponzi scheme could be to blame.

On Aug. 14, Dovey Wan — founding partner of blockchain-based investment company Primitive Ventures — called attention to the ongoing mass sell-offs from the fraudulent Chinese investment scheme, dubbed PlusToken.

10 million investors scammed of $3 billion

As Wan outlines, PlusToken was created in mid-2018 and promised high yield investment returns at different rebate percentages to its four tiers of member — a classic Ponzi scheme structure. By early 2019, the project claimed to have over 10 million members.

Wan has attached data on all the wallet addresses — including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and EOS — known to be associated with PlusToken and urgently called on exchanges and over-the-counter platforms to blacklist them.

She notes that Chinese police hunted down a core team member of the scheme two months ago and have revealed that investors were scammed of a whopping $3 billion.

Alongside the addresses, Wan has attached investigative data from security audit firm Peckshield that reveals the money flow from PlusToken’s wallet as of early July, the date the sell-offs are thought to have begun:

Incessant sell-offs

Despite the arrest, the cryptocurrency cannot reportedly be rolled back, as Wan explains:

“Many of their BTC addresses are started with P2SH which commonly used for mutil-sig, most likely some ppl who hold the keys are not being caught hence police can’t unlock the wallet. For EOS/ETH wallet can be diff case but so far police was not able to touch any of those.”

In an attempt to curb the impact of the sell-offs, she has recommended that Peckshield and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis analyze the flows more closely, noting that PlusToken appears to be moving their funds in small batches of 50-100 BTC into exchanges.

Chinese traders have reportedly claimed that an unknown address has in recent days been dumping 100 BTC incessantly on crypto exchange Binance, which Wan suspects to be connected to the scheme.

As just reported, the PlusToken scheme was identified as being the largest single incident of loss in a recent summary of 2019 crypto-related theft from blockchain security firm CipherTrace, having purportedly defrauded investors of $2.9 billion.",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-coinbase-acquires-xapos-institutional-custody-business,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has acquired the institutional business of cryptocurrency wallet and custody service provider Xapo.

Coinbase said in an announcement on Thursday that the deal will help expand its custody business and will increase its assets under custody to be more than $7 billion.

According to a Fortune report on Thursday, Coinbase acquired Xapo’s institutional business for $55 million after beating another strong contender, the investment giant Fidelity.

Coinbase Custody’s CEO Sam McIngvale indicated in the report that the exchange could look into crypto lending business in the future. “Fundamentally, we have to help our investors earn a return on their assets. You can imagine lending out bitcoin and earning interest on that,” McIngvale was quoted as saying.

Launched in 2013, Xapo is known for its wallet services including physical vaults stationed in Switzerland that are used to store customers’ crypto assets in an offline environment to ensure the safety of private keys.

Fortune’s report added that with this deal, most of Xapo’s biggest clients have already decided to move their crypto assets to Coinbase, which will now store more than 514,000 bitcoin for Xapo’s customers, worth $5.3 billion at its current price.

In May this year, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 event that Coinbase Custody had just crossed $1 billion in assets under management at the time with 70 institutions.

The report today said if Coinbase would be able to onboard remaining customers of Xapo, then its custody service will have more than 860,000 bitcoin in total under custody, worth over $8 billion.

“In choosing Coinbase, we are confident that the Institutional Custody Business is going to a company that can provide great insurance, borrowing and investment alternatives,” said Xapo’s founder and CEO Wences Casares. “We believe that Coinbase will take this opportunity to prove to our customers that they deserve their business.”

The company offers a product called Coinmine One, which is an all-purpose cryptocurrency mining computer that costs $700.

The announcement also included a shoutout to previous investors, who include familiar names such as Coinbase Ventures and Anthony Pompliano. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Robot Ventures also invested in Coinmine in Q1 2019. Robot Ventures, for its part, is a blockchain-focused Venture Capital firm which has in turn received funding from Ripple’s Xpring, which funds Ripple-related development initiatives.

Additionally, Coinmine says its mission is to support Bitcoin and other decentralized information protocols. As per the announcement, Coinmine believes that decentralizing computation will lead to a corresponding decentralization of information and value, as related to the ideology behind Bitcoin.

Promoting decentralized computing

As reported by Cointelegraph yesterday, the Icon Foundation launched an incentives initiative to encourage users to participate in voting and staking for its blockchain network. Icon’s idea here was to distribute control of their network via election, as well as to give users more influence over how this network computation gets distributed via voting. As its rewards incentive, the foundation is purportedly dedicating 3 million of its native ICX tokens, worth approximately $570,000, to hand out to users who vote on the network controllers.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/these-portfolio-trackingtools-will-also-prepare-your-crypto-taxes/,"These Portfolio Tracking Tools Will Also Prepare Your Crypto Taxes

Tax season is months away, which is why you need to start preparing for it now. Leave everything to the last minute and you’ll only end up cursing your procrastination. Organize your cryptocurrency activity in advance and you’ll breeze through tax deadline day without so much as flinching. Despite maddeningly vague or unfair legislation, filing your crypto taxes is surprisingly simple thanks to an array of tools that make tracking and calculating your obligations a cinch.

Crypto Taxation Doesn’t Have to Be Testing

Whatever your thoughts on paying tax, the fact of the matter is that it’s an unavoidable obligation. Unless you’re fortunate enough to live in a country that doesn’t impose income tax (here’s looking at you Bermuda, Monaco, Bahamas, Andorra and the United Arab Emirates), come April, you’re going to have to pay your dues. There’s no getting around it, but that doesn’t mean you have to approach the close of the tax year with a sense of dread. With the right planning, you can automate much of the process, saving yourself no end of time, hassle and expense.

Accurately filing your crypto taxes calls for maintaining detailed records of all your transactions and trades that occur over the course of the year. As a result, most of the specialist tax software on the market also doubles as an excellent portfolio tracker. That’s right: even if you have no interest in paying tax, you can still derive value from a product that records all of your crypto gains (and losses), and presents them in an attractive package that can be viewed on desktop or mobile. The following tools provide all that plus a whole lot more.

Koinly

Koinly promises to help cryptocurrency owners calculate their taxes and minimize their bill in the process. It’s compatible with the tax system in over 100 countries and is free to start using: you’re only charged when you need to generate a tax report. When you sign up, you’re prompted to select whether you wish it to realize gains every time you trade crypto; if you select no, Koinly will simply serve as your portfolio tracker. Like the other tools profiled here, Koinly requires you to link exchange accounts and wallets, which can be done manually or via API. You can then review your transactions, tag airdrops, forks, and lost or gifted coins. 33 exchanges are supported as well as six blockchains including BCH, LTC, and BTC.

Koinly automatically matches transfers between your wallets and shows you gains or losses for each transaction. There are also tools for analyzing your trading habits, tax loss harvesting, and cost tracking including mining expenses. The Hodler plan ($79 per year) covers 300 transactions and can record income and capital gains tax. The Trader plan ($179) covers 3,000 transactions, while Oracle ($399) has capacity for 10,000 transactions and offers enhanced support and import assistance.

Blox

Blox offers many of the same features as Koinly, but is targeted at crypto businesses as well as individuals. It benefits from CPA tools that allow teams to create an auditable record of all crypto activities, which can be exported as a CSV or imported directly into accountancy software that Blox has integrated with. Your current portfolio is neatly displayed in the dashboard, where you can view an account overview, access specific transactions, and see a daily snapshot of your portfolio. With thousands of cryptocurrencies listed within Blox, even the most dubious of tokens can be tracked and the corresponding tax obligations calculated.

Blox provides a detailed guide to prepping your taxes using their software, after which you can file your crypto taxes or export the data to your bookkeeper, who can take care of the rest. There’s also a suite of tools devised specifically for cryptocurrency miners, including cloud-hosted mining solutions. Blox even operates its own nodes to help ensure that transactions and balances are accurate. The Pro plan is free and covers 100 transactions (tx) and up to $50K AUM, while the Business plan, at $99 per month, covers 10K tx and $20M in assets. There’s also an Enterprise plan ($249) for heavy users that will accommodate a whopping $60M AUM.

Bittax

Complying with amorphous and frequently shifting tax guidelines can be challenging. Bittax aims to set cryptocurrency owners at ease by providing expert guidance on the latest decrees from the IRS. At its heart, Bittax is a crypto tax organizer that works similarly to the other products profiled here: import your wallet addresses and exchange data and the software will calculate your taxes. It uses a proprietary tax planning algorithm that helps to efficiently organize and consolidate your liabilities, without compromising your precious privacy. For U.S. citizens seeking to do everything by the book, and to meet the most rigorous standards set by the IRS, Bittax has got your back.

Cointracking

Cointracking’s greatest strength is as a cryptocurrency portfolio monitor. Its tax prepping properties are also useful, but the quality of the insights it provides active traders is particularly good. There’s a timeline tool, which populates with trading milestones, there are charts displaying your balance per day, trades per month, trades per exchange, average purchase price and much more. When it comes to taxes, Cointracking supports the FIFO, LIFO, HIFO and LOFO methods, of which FIFO (first in, first out) is the most commonly used.

There’s the ability to track coins that have been held for longer than a year, and which can thus be sold tax-free in certain jurisdictions. Other tools include the ability for U.S. citizens to create an FBAR report in the event of them owning foreign financial accounts containing assets worth over $10,000. The number of exchanges and wallets that Cointracking supports via API or CSV is impressive; there’s even legacy support for closed exchanges, from Btce to Mt. Gox. The free plan covers 200 tx, rising to 3,500 for Pro. There’s also an Unlimited plan for heavy traders. Another good thing about Cointracking is that you can pay for your subscription in BTC including the option to take out a lifetime license.

Don’t Let Tax Take Over Your Life

In many countries, the U.S. especially, the laws concerning crypto taxation are unfair, vague, and subject to interpretation. Only last month, North Carolina’s Rep. Ted Budd reintroduced the Virtual Value Tax Fix Act in the U.S. House of Representatives. The bill seeks to put a stop to the double tax that is currently imposed on cryptocurrency, making it unnecessarily complex to calculate and record tax every time a purchase is made.

As a cryptocurrency user, there’s little you can do to influence government policy when it comes to taxes; the state moves ponderously, and it may be a while yet before citizens in the U.S. and elsewhere see anything approaching a fair crypto tax policy. In the meantime, the best thing you can do is record your transactions using a purpose-built tool and then get on with your life in the knowledge that the hard part is done. Automate your tax and then you can relax.

Kiwis can now get paid in crypto.

Bitcoin faces legal uncertainty in much of the world, but this month the cryptocurrency received a major vote of confidence in New Zealand. In its August tax information bulletin (pdf), the country’s Inland Revenue Department published binding rules approving salaries and wages paid in cryptocurrency.

Digital currency proponents applauded the arrangement as innovative. Many who work in the crypto industry as contractors—often as programmers, community managers, and researchers—accept payment in tokens. In the US, by comparison, crypto enthusiasts have been waiting nearly five years for the IRS to update its guidance on the treatment of crypto transactions.

Although New Zealand approved crypto as compensation for salaried and wage-earning workers, the framework is strict. Crypto payments must be subject to an employment agreement, be for a fixed amount, and comprise a “regular part of the employee’s remuneration.” Furthermore, crypto pay cannot be subject to a “lock-up” period, and the digital currency (or currencies) must be readily convertible into a traditional, government-backed currency like the New Zealand Dollar. New Zealand’s Inland Revenue also notes that crypto payments are subject to normal tax laws, like the country’s Pay As You Earn and Fringe Benefits Tax regimes.

New Zealand’s tax authority names a few examples of cryptocurrencies that are okay to use, because “a significant purpose of the crypto-asset is to function like a currency.” These include bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, ether, and litecoin. This doesn’t include filecoin, dentacoin, and CRYPTO20, the tax agency noted.

Cryptos “pegged to one or more fiat currencies,” such as Tether and the Paxos Standard, are also okay for use as wages and salaries. Only stablecoins that are readily convertible into fiat money on an exchange satisfy the rules, the agency stressed.

Altogether, New Zealand’s approach to crypto pay could encourage more mainstream adoption of crypto assets, under certain conditions. In a country known for monetary innovation, the move could serve as a model for other regulators.

REGULATORY WATCH

The US Securities and Exchange Commission postponed a decision on exchange-traded funds linked to bitcoin once again. If approved, a bitcoin ETF could allow the cryptocurrency to be listed alongside stocks on many brokerage platforms. On stock trading websites today, bitcoin is sometimes listed through Grayscale’s GBTC, a fund that typically trades at a 20% premium or more to the prevailing bitcoin price.

Many crypto traders believe a bitcoin ETF would help introduce digital currency to the investing public, but SEC chairman Jay Clayton has expressed reservations about the vehicle due to frequent theft and apparent price manipulation. The SEC has until mid-October to make a final decision on bitcoin ETF proposals from asset managers Bitwise and VanEck. The repeated delays in coming to a decision may not be a good sign for the funds.

From 600 early-stage users, MoonRekt has grown to more than 37,000 registered players – albeit if some were enticed with free HXRO, tokens native to the platform.

The game initially allowed users to bet HXRO, worth about 5 cents, on whether bitcoin’s price will rise or fall within a 5-minute window. Though the game is steeped in crypto’s ironic swagger, referring to price swings as MOON or REKT, the stakes are real.

Now, players will be able to bet the far more valuable cryptocurrency, bitcoin.

“As professional traders, we want to create a platform that mimicked the high-energy experience in the pits of the largest global derivatives exchanges,” said Rob Levy, Hxro’s president and co-founder.

Up the ante

“Our goal is to eventually become the preeminent alternative venue for playing cryptocurrencies, and we expect to add additional token protocols as demand for them reaches a critical mass,” said Hxro CEO Dan Gunsberg, in a statement.

The team also plans to launch a game that simulates portfolio construction, called MUHBAGS. A company representative said, players will compete against one another as “fantasy traders” to see who can build the best portfolio.

Additionally, according to a statement, the company plans on expanding the number of bonuses and rewards on offer, which will be a boon to users of HXRO tokens.

For now, however, the company will continue to take a flat 3 percent from the pot on both the HXRO and BTC versions of MoonRekt.

Perhaps you’d like your bitcoin buried in a vault under a mountain in the Swiss Alps? Xapo has offered that as a service to wealthy investors, for free. Coinbase, best known for its popular cryptocurrency exchange, prefers elaborate key-printing rituals along with a Faraday cage. Anchorage, an Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup, promises easy-access digital storage with some cryptographic voodoo. And now old-school firms like Fidelity and Bakkt, which shares an owner with the New York Stock Exchange, are jumping into the fray with storage solutions of their own.

The aim behind all these sophisticated security arrangements: wooing Wall Street.

Gregory Barber covers cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence for WIRED.

A key property of crypto is that it’s proven a pretty dang easy target for thieves. Whether it’s North Korea hammering crypto businesses around the world or an exchange founder absconding with cash, vulnerabilities are abundant. For the crypto industry, that’s not a good look, especially when it comes to institutional investors—pensions and hedge funds and university endowments—for whom there are major consequences when breaches occur. For them, it’s not just a good idea to nail down the furniture, it’s the law.

This week, the still-fringe world of crypto custody saw a spike in activity. Late Thursday, Coinbase’s custody arm purchased the institutional business of rival Xapo for a reported $55 million. The deal wasn’t a surprise, following reports this spring that Coinbase had outbid Fidelity Digital Assets, which started offering custody to clients in March. Then on Friday, Bakkt announced that it had received approval to offer bitcoin futures in September, following months of regulatory delays.

So is crypto the next big thing in institutional investment, or is this fighting over scraps? For now, crypto custody still involves a relatively small pool of money. Coinbase got a boost earlier this month when Grayscale Investments moved its $2.7 billion worth of crypto funds from Xapo to Coinbase, more than doubling the company’s assets under custody. That’s tiny compared with the trillions under management for a company like Fidelity. Custody competitors like Palo Alto, California-based BitGo have reportedly been circling for Xapo’s other clients.

Still, companies like Coinbase and Fidelity think there’s room for growth. In May, Fidelity released a survey of more than 400 institutional investors that found 22 percent already held cryptocurrency, and another quarter saw potential to do so.

The companies point to the recent surge in bitcoin’s price as a sign that investors are warming up to crypto. Fundamentally, nothing has changed since late 2017, when the price of bitcoin spiked to nearly $20,000, driven mainly by hysteria. It’s still backed by nothing and managed by no government; it’s still dominated by a select set of mining pools, based mainly in China. Now, though, there’s a more sophisticated economy being built around crypto, says John Sedunov, a professor of finance at Villanova University. In February, JP Morgan announced it would start a coin of its own. Then in June, Facebook announced its Libra cryptocurrency with the backing of large consumer tech companies like Uber and Spotify. New vehicles like futures contracts offer investors, who might’ve balked at an asset with price shocks that come out of nowhere, more of a buffer.

Another interpretation is that bitcoin is increasingly seen as a way to hedge against uncertainty, notes Sedunov. While volatility means that it’s not a safe harbor, like gold or the Swiss franc, it is a potential hedge when nations take up arms in a global trade war. “There’s uncertainty in where we’re heading, and that makes cryptocurrency more attractive,” he says. The better custody arrangements are another draw, he suggests, making it more appealing for institutional investors who could potentially store hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital assets.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-sends-mixed-signals-as-ether-and-bitcoin-price-see-green,"Friday, Aug. 16 — Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are seeing some upward movement as XRP continues to slump.

Bitcoin is trading at $10,480 at press time, representing a 4.58% price increase on the day. Bitcoin is seeing some momentum for an upward climb, peaking at $10,500 so far and continuing to stay away from the four-figure mark it fell to yesterday. Still, BTC needs to climb by about 15% to retake the $12,000 barrier, which it surpassed multiple times earlier this month.

Earlier today, anticipated BTC futures platform Bakkt announced that it has been approved for launch — namely by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and New York State Department of Financial Services — and will roll out on Sept. 23.

A review of over 50 patent applications submitted by the People’s Bank of China shows t he design of its central bank digital currency will only resemble a cryptocurrency in limited ways.

he design of its central bank digital currency will only resemble a cryptocurrency in limited ways. A senior official at the central bank said the effort will be helpful to “restrain public’s demands for crypto assets and to strengthen the country’s sovereign currency.”

Far from emulating the decentralized aspects of ether and bitcoin, the official emphasized the issuance of the central bank’s digital currency will stick to a centralized management model.

China may be about to launch a fiat digital currency, but in all likelihood, it will only resemble a cryptocurrency on the surface.

And it probably won’t use a blockchain. While inspired to some degree by bitcoin and the like, the effort is explicitly framed as a strategy to beat them back.

The project was thrust into the spotlight last weekend when a senior official from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said at a closed-door conference that the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) is ready to launch.

In his speech, widely covered in the press, Changchun Mu, deputy director at the PBoC’s payments division, notably said:

“Since last year, the staff at the Digital Currency Research Lab have been working 996 to develop the system. We can say the CBDC is now ready to launch at one’s call.”

(996 is a phrase commonly used in the Chinese tech startup scene, referring to working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week.)

The CBDC aims to replace M0, meaning cash in circulation, via a two-tier system: the central bank issues the digital yuan only to commercial banks, who will further issue it to the public, Mu said. This approach is perhaps unsurprising since Yao Qian, the former chief of the research lab, hinted at this design in an op-ed published in CoinDesk in 2017.

However, one comment from Mu that got overlooked by many is that he believes “the two-tier issuance system will be helpful to restrain the public’s demands for crypto assets and strengthen the country’s sovereign currency.”

Mu did not elaborate on how everyday users would interact with this proposed mechanism or to what extent the CBDC really employs distributed ledger technology. And it remains unclear when the central bank plans to test and roll it out or, upon its launch, whether it will be optional or mandatory for Chinese consumers.

But dozens of patent applications submitted by the research lab to China’s State Intellectual Property Office reviewed by CoinDesk offer a window into the PBoC’s thinking on how the system may function and its similarities and (more importantly) differences with crypto.

Crypto-inspired

The PBoC’s Digital Currency Research Lab was formally launched in the summer of 2017 and spearheaded by Yao Qian, although Mu indicated the work has been ongoing for five years. Yao left the position for a different agency around October 2018.

To date, the lab has filed more than 50 patent applications, all either invented or co-invented by Yao, and about 20 of those focus on design specifications of a so-called digital currency wallet.

Each document covers a specific technology feature of the proposed system, ranging from how to apply for and create a wallet, how to transfer money to and from saving accounts, how a peer-to-peer transaction is verified, etc.

The goal is to build a wallet to store digitized yuan that is unlike the electronic wallets of any bank or third-party payments application. Those wallets, one patent document says, are “merely an extension of assets held in custody at a bank account.” As such, the approach borrows the idea from bitcoin of a peer-to-peer transaction system where users possess private keys to control the asset.

One patent application, entitled “a method and system for enquiring digital currency transaction information” filed on Dec. 28, 2017, describes a digital currency wallet that aims to bridge the gap between existing electronic wallets and “private quasi-digital currency wallets, like that of bitcoin.”

The former is not an independent wallet, which may incur security issues, and the latter, while allowing users to personally possess their assets, does so in an anonymous way with transactions of that can’t be reversed, the document further states.

Another patent application added:

“The emergence of digital currency is an inevitable trend. So far, privately issued digital currency bears the features of anonymity and volatility. Central banks must take their impacts on the payments, monetary systems and financial stability seriously. As such, it’s inevitable for central banks to push for digitized fiat currencies to optimize their circulation.”

KYC-ed digital yuan

And one crucial way to optimize such circulation appears to be stripping the anonymity feature of cryptocurrencies and including a know-your-customer (KYC) process required by other payment methods.

So far, physical cash is arguably the only form of fiat money inside China that can remain anonymous, compared to bank wire or third-party methods offered by companies like Alibaba or WeChat – both requiring real-name verification authenticated by users’ IDs and banking information.

“Existing M0 (banknotes and coins) are subject to counterfeit and money laundering risks. … The [CBDC] system should follow the existing rules about anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing imposed on cash, and should report to the PBoC on large amounts and suspicious transactions,” Mu emphasized during his speech.

His note echoes the design specifications entailed by various patent applications for the proposed peer-to-peer digital currency wallets.

For example, the patent application on how to apply and create digital wallets filed on Dec. 28, 2017 stated that the system lets users apply through their banks and the creation of such digital currency wallets will be registered at the issuance organization.

Another document detailing how to redeem the CBDC from saving accounts filed on June 26, 2017 explained that after a user sends a request to withdraw money from their saving accounts – similar to withdrawing from an ATM, except now it’s not cash but in a p2p wallet – the corresponding issuers will need to verify a user’s ID before granting the redemption.

And after that, when a user initiates a payment transaction from the independent digital wallet, a third party will verify who is sending how much to whom.

A third document detailing this method states:

“A sender would authorize a payment deduction request to a receiver’s digital currency wallet. The receiver would verify such request, which will then be sent to the CBDC issuance registration system. The payment will complete after the verification of such request [by the system].”

In addition, another document specifies a system that aims to customize a tracking solution to make the CBDC traceable even across multiple owners and layers.

All of this, of course, is a far cry from bitcoin, where there is no central authority, anyone can download software and create a wallet without presenting ID, and payments can be made without any middleman’s permission.

Decentralized no more?

Another open question is to what degree the PBoC’s digital currency system may include the features of blockchain, if at all.

One of the earliest patent documents filed more than two years ago detailed that the central bank did at one point explore the idea of using a distributed network to manage nodes for verifying transactions.

“This technology would empower smart contracts on a blockchain infrastructure to dynamically manage nodes in the network to ensure they share and transact the same data with security and scalability,” the doc stated.

Mu’s speech also alluded to this approach but added that the strategy has indeed changed over the years. At the very beginning, the research lab did build a prototype completely on blockchain infrastructure but later encountered the issue of scalability, he said, adding:

“Since we are using digital fiat currency to replace M0, to reach a retail-level adoption, the first issue that we can’t bypass is the demand for high-volume transactions.”

Mu used the example of a shopping holiday popular among young people in China to show how blockchains aren’t suitable for mass adoption:

“Our payments network during last year’s Singles’ Day sale at its peak handled 92,771 transactions per second. In comparison, bitcoin and ethereum handles seven and 10 to 20 transactions per second, respectively. [Facebook’s] Libra, based on its recently released white paper, is 1,000 transactions per second. For a country as big as China, it’s impossible to achieve high scalability by purely relying on blockchain. As such, we have decided to remain technologically neutral and do not necessarily rely on one fixed technological path.”

He concluded in his speech that although crypto assets have the natural feature of decentralization, the PBoC’s Digital Currency, under the two-tier system, must stick to a centralized management model.

“Only designated organizations can operate the redemption and needs to be centrally managed to prevent over-issuance and to ensure the central bank’s management position,” he said.

Peer-to-peer Bitcoin (BTC) marketplace Paxful shared the results of its new survey — conducted together with Toluna Insights — with Cointelegraph on Aug. 15.

50% of Young Colombians Already Crypto Investors

The survey further revealed that at least 50% of respondents between the ages of 25 and 40 have already invested or expressed interest in buying cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (79%), Bytecoin (>5%) or Ether (ETH) (<3%).

Just over 32% of all those surveyed had already carried out transactions using cryptocurrencies.

Almost 59% said they that cryptocurrency adoption would continue to grow. In its analysis of the results, Paxful noted that:

“The increased use of digital currencies is likely linked to a hyperconnected generation constantly on the lookout for options that not only allow them to have 24/7 access to their financial assets but also give them the freedom to make online global transactions in a simple way.”

Close to 86% said they believed crypto-specific regulation would be necessary in Colombia. Meanwhile, a whopping 91% of those surveyed agreed with the idea that cryptocurrencies will mark the future of world trade.

Notwithstanding these impressive and positive results, just under 20% of respondents said they would currently use cryptocurrencies as a financial alternative.

In light of the protracted political turmoil in neighbouring Venezuela, Colombia has this summer reported an uptick in migration. Notably, trading volume on LocalBitcoins in both countries has continued to see an upward trend in recent months.

Surveying the field

As reported, a spring 2019 survey revealed that 11% of the American population owns Bitcoin, indicating that Bitcoin ownership is a “demographic mega-trend” led by the younger generation in the 18-34 year age range. Nonetheless, 89% of United States citizens had heard of the cryptocurrency, regardless of their generation.

A more recent survey this summer — again focused on the U.S. — suggested that cryptocurrencies are three times more popular among American millennials as a long-term investment as they are for Generation X.

In June, a survey of a total of 13,434 respondents in 22 countries indicated that 19% of people worldwide have purchased cryptocurrencies, with only 10% saying they did not fully understand how cryptocurrencies work.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/08/16/nvidias-gpu-sales-normalize-crypto-mining-craze/,"Chipmaker Nvidia says its business has finally returned to normal after its cryptocurrency mining hangover has subsided.

In its latest quarterly financial report, published yesterday, Nvidia posted 17 percent growth in revenue – from $2.22 billion to $2.58 billion – over the last fiscal quarter. Across the same period in the previous financial year, the GPU giant posted revenue of $3.12 billion – a figure largely influenced by increased demand from cryptocurrency miners.

Speaking on a conference call, Nvidia’s chief financial officer Collette Kress told analysts: “Essentially our business is normalized.”

“We’ve reached normalized levels through the last couple of quarters and this quarter, just very similar to what we will see going forward,” Kress added.

Nvidia’s $3.12 billion revenue posted last year largely came as a result from demand for its gaming GPU chips used by cryptocurrency miners. Demand that Nvidia says largely “exceeded expectations.”

However, the boom in revenue was short-lived. Cryptocurrency prices tumbled and as the end of the year closed in, demand from miners dried up. In November 2018, Nvidia posted disappointing results and forecast a bleak outlook for cryptocurrency mining demand.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said cryptocurrency mining would likely add “no contributions” to bottom line in the coming months.

With the latest news, it appears he was correct.

Even so, sales of GPUs (graphics processing units) still make up the majority of Nvidia’s business, generating 81 percent of total revenue.

While sales of desktop GPUs are down, the company cited increased demand for gaming laptop chips as one of the main drivers for its quarter on quarter growth.

As part of an ATO effort to warn against high-risk retirement investment strategies, 18,000 holders of Self-Managed Super Funds (SMSFs), a type of retirement account privately managed by individuals, were told they face penalties up to 4,200 AUD for breaching regulations, according to local media reports.

While the letter targeted any SMSF holder with over 90 percent of their retirement savings in a single asset – primarily in property – the ATO also singled out cryptocurrencies as a high-risk investment.

“We have already seen two instances of SMSFs losing significant amounts of their retirement savings through investment in cryptocurrency,” an ATO spokesperson told the Australian news site Micky.

To be clear, it’s not the asset class itself the agency warns against, but being highly overexposed in any one asset.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) takes a similar line:

“Be wary of services offering to establish an SMSF for you in order to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. Not only does operating an SMSF involve significant time, skills and responsibility, you may also be putting your retirement savings at risk.”

Neither the ATO or ASIC responded to requests for comment by press time.

Staked – which has the backing of some of the most notable funds in crypto, including Pantera, Winklevoss Capital and Coinbase Ventures – helps holders of proof-of-stake tokens maximize their returns.

Its new listing, PERL, allows access to a suite of applications designed to aid the international trade and trade finance industry, which is still very much bogged down by paperwork, according to Perlin CEO Dorjee Sun.

“If you were to send a container to Indonesia, it takes two days for the container to go but five days for the paperwork,” Sun explained in call with CoinDesk from Singapore.

Sun said the Singapore-based company raised $50 million last year from investors that include Arrington XRP Capital, FBG, BlockTower Capital and Global Brain.

Grassroots consensus

Underlying PERL is the Perlin-built Wavelet blockchain, which maintains consensus across various records held in Perlin’s logistics applications.

Wavelet was designed to use what it calls leaderless proof-of-stake consensus. That is, one in which even users with small stakes have a chance to benefit from participating in the network’s consensus.

A very simple way to think about how it works, according to Perlin, is to imagine thousands of nodes tracking transactions as they come in. Wavelet randomly surveys and re-surveys nodes at each block to verify that everyone agrees.

That way, it doesn’t have to default to the largest holders of its cryptocurrency, ensuring the rich get richer and shutting out the small-time PERL holder.

Consensus rewards come from transaction fees paid by users of Perlin’s applications. The current economic model of Perlin is fixed with its initial supply 1,033,200,000 PERL. It’s currently selling a little under 86,530,500 PERL on Binance Launchpad, with a hard cap of $6.7 million.

Because Binance uses a lottery system, Perlin will distribute an additional 3,874,500 PERL to launchpad participants that do not come out with a winning ticket, in an airdrop.

That said, Sun explained that PERL is also a governance token, and if users want to change the economic model later (such as creating some kind of inflationary mechanism), they can do so.

Multi-pronged democratization

While the company argues it’s not resource-intensive to run a Wavelet node, the company also believes joining a network like Staked further enhances its openness, by providing an option to take part for users who don’t have the wherewithal (in time, skill or equipment) to set up a node.

For more technically minded users, though, Wavelet is built to work with WebAssembly. Not only does this make participating in consensus easier, but it opens up decentralized applications to almost any developer doing work with today’s internet.

Vincent Zhou, founder of FBG Capital, said in a press release that both companies were inviting more people into crypto.

“I believe their immense contributions to the space will raise up the entire ecosystem,” Zhou said. “Staked by making staking dead easy for investors and Perlin by vastly simplifying smart contract and dApp development with ground-breaking WebAssembly support.”

Staked currently supports Algorand, Tezos, Livepeer, Cosmos, Dash, Decred and others.

“On Perlin, we were attracted by a big vision that we think has strong real-world potential,” Staked CEO Tim Ogilvie told CoinDesk, adding:

“It’s also important that we support our customers’ investments. Many of the Perlin investors are existing customers of ours.”

The island, which lies 282 miles south of Seoul and is also a province, announced on August 13th the establishment of the “Global Blockchain Hub City Development Research Service,” in which it will be investing 175 million won ($145,000) for research running through December.

The modest project will be carried out by Tilon, a Seoul-based company specializing in secure virtualization. Established in 2001, the company often works with local governments and a wide variety of public institutions.

Under the terms of the agreement, Tilon will analyze possible blockchain services suitable for the island and develop a model for blockchain on Jeju. A roadmap will be delivered. As part of the engagement, Tilon will examine advances in the U.S. and the U.K.

The goal of the project is to establish the island as another hub for blockchain in South Korea.

Jeju is in a unique position to achieve the relevant developments. Under a special deal with the national government, it has been self-governing since 2006. No other province has that designation. Jeju has considerable freedom in terms of local administration and legislation and has ambitions to use its autonomy to become a “Free International City.”

In recent years, blockchain and crypto have become central to the island’s plans. The Modified 2nd Comprehensive Plan Jeju Free International City, published in February 2017, makes specific reference to the creation of a virtual currency.

Since South Korea’s Financial Services Commission banned ICOs in September 2017, Jeju has been attempting to use its special status as a way to circumvent the regulation and become the country’s only area for these offerings. In 2018, Governor Won Hee-ryong was reelected on a pro-ICO platform.

In March 2019, the island established the Jeju Blockchain Smart City Composition Association (JBCSCCA), and the possibility of a crypto exchange was discussed, to be called “Bit-Island.”

But little has come of the island’s many efforts, and Jeju was passed over as the country’s chosen blockchain hub just last month. Other areas, such as Seoul City, are also pushing their own programs and threaten to eclipse Jeju in terms of blockchain initiatives.

On Friday, a variety of paid press releases were published stemming from a company called Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings, a firm that claims a big “reveal” is coming on Sunday, August 18. According to the announcement, Satoshi Nakamoto will divulge his “real-life identity” alongside his “country of origin, education, professional background, and why he has yet to move any of his 980,000 bitcoins.” Many cryptocurrency supporters believe the press release is nothing more than a market ploy similar to the Gotsatoshi.com ruse ‘unveiled’ last May.

Another So-Called Satoshi Plans to Reveal His Identity

There have been so many self-styled Satoshi Nakamotos over the years it’s starting to get hard to keep track of them all. Now this weekend on Sunday, August 18, another person who claims to be Bitcoin’s inventor is supposedly doing a “reveal” to show the world he’s Satoshi. The press release published by a PR agency called Ivy McLemore & Associates never mentions who the mysterious man is, but claims that the person will be disclosing his true “real-life identity.” “After a decade of anonymity, Satoshi Nakamoto will break his silence in Part I of his ‘My Reveal,’” the media release explains. The statement to the press stemming from the company Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings can be found on various paid press service websites.

“Indicative of the compelling evidence he presents in each part of the series, Nakamoto will illustrate the role that cyphers and encryption related to his devotion to Chaldean numerology played in many decisions in his creation of Bitcoin,” the announcement claims. Moreover, the so-called Satoshi revealer aims to publicize why he registered the website Bitcoin.org 11 years ago. The statement adds:

Nakamoto also will disclose why he chose the date August 18 not only to register Bitcoin.org in 2008 but also to release Part I of “My Reveal” this coming Sunday on the 11th anniversary of his registration of Bitcoin.org through Anonymousspeech.com.

Here We Go Again — There’s No ‘Blank Slate’ When It Comes to All the Satoshi Marketing Ploys

The company behind the reveal says that the revelations will allegedly culminate Tuesday with part II and III being published on the two websites mentioned in the media statement. The public will be introduced to the “Tabula Rasa, his clean-slate vision for Bitcoin’s transformational rebirth, and the declaration of his identity.” The Tabula Rasa is a theory defined by John Locke that suggests humans are born with a “blank slate” and everything is learned through one’s sensory experiences. What this theory means for the Bitcoin network is anyone’s guess, and it’s likely written in a cryptic way to keep a person curious about the so-called reveal on Sunday. The reveal day follows a similar announcement made last May when the creators of the website Gotsatoshi.com revealed themselves, and it turned out to be a cryptocurrency news feed app for mobile phones. Despite the last Satoshi reveal marketing ploy, the cryptocurrency community has been discussing the matter. “Cryptographically signed message or piss off,” exclaimed the Casa CTO Jameson Lopp.

Since the whole Craig Wright fiasco and the multitude of other self-proclaimed Satoshi’s, people seem to be getting tired of deception and sensational tactics. “Even if somebody did sign/verify the genesis block it doesn’t mean they are Satoshi,” the Twitter handle Bitconsultants responded to Lopp’s tweet. “It just means they have the keys. At this point, it’s next to impossible to prove who Satoshi is/was,” the account further remarked. Digital currency enthusiasts have also been responding to the announcement tweet stemming from Ivy McLemore. “Just get him to move a coin from the genesis block, then people will be bothered,” one person wrote to the PR agency. Another individual tweeted:

This would literally be the single stupidest move he/she/they could make and it would be known to be — 100% bullshit.

And the Satoshi LARP Award Goes to…

The story highlights the fact that there are a great number of people in search of the mysterious Nakamoto, but now marketers and businesses are using this desire to their advantage. It also shows the ridiculous number of Satoshi suspects and those who have claimed to be the currency’s creator. There’s the Hawaiian domain owner, Bitcoin Origins writer Scronty, the writer called “Duality,” the Bulgarian Debo Jurgen Etienne Guido, and of course the Australian who has claimed to be Satoshi for years. There are also Nakamoto suspects who are not alive or are in jail like the criminal mastermind Paul Le Roux, the forensics investigator David Kleiman, and the renowned cryptographer Hal Finney. There have been so many claimants over the years that it’s not even unbelievable anymore that people are willing to come forward and say they created Bitcoin. If anything the crypto community might want to host a live-action role-playing (LARP) award ceremony for all the nuts who say they are Satoshi.

These Satoshi revealers have put far more energy into the Nakamoto LARP in contrast to the simplicity of merely verifying an old message or private keys. Instead, we have people creating domains using Satoshi’s name for marketing purposes, people writing memoirs, and Bitcoin inventors with their own PR teams. A great example of these ludicrous theatrical performances was back in May 2016 when Quartz columnist Joon Ian Wong reported that Craig Wright allegedly used the rockstar David Bowie’s PR agency, Outside Organisation, to help with the big reveal that week. Outside Organisation was so good that they were able to get the public’s eyes fixated on Bowie, David Beckham, the Spice Girls, and allegedly the self-proclaimed Satoshi. Wong’s Quartz article details that during the Wright reveal ceremonies reporters from three different publications were “selected” for “proof sessions.” In addition to David Bowie’s PR firm, the selected journalists from the Economist, GQ, and the BBC publications were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDA) in order to participate in the reveal, Wong detailed.

The Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings PR attempt is not much different than the slew of wannabes and attention seekers in the past. Part I of his “My Reveal” on Sunday, August 18, at 4 p.m. EDT will be shown on the company website, Satoshinhr.com. Its likely people will tune in to hear what the person has to say for a brief period of time, but its more probable that the reveal will be nothing more than a tacky marketing attempt in order to highlight something else. An illustration of the announcement’s marketing nonsense can be read under the Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance (SNR) Holdings business description, which states the company is a provider of “blockchain technologies to help transform people’s lives.” In reality, the only thing this announcement will likely provide is another attempt at Satoshi performance art — And a poor one, too.

What do you think about the so-called Satoshi reveal scheduled for Sunday? Do you think it’s just another marketing ruse? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Also today, Cointelegraph reported that crypto lending firm Nexo had paid its token holders a total of $2,409,574.87 in dividends, reaching an annualized dividend yield of 12.73%.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-zealand-rules-for-crypto-salary-have-hopes-been-answered,"The national tax authority of New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), has recently published binding rulings and guidance for salaries and bonuses paid in crypto, made under s 91D of the country's Tax Administration Act of 1994. This ruling applies only to salary and wage earners and not to self-employed individuals, and only for services performed by an employee for a fixed amount and as a regular part of his/her remuneration.

While some may find this as proof that New Zealand has officially declared that income paid in cryptocurrencies is legal, the future of crypto adoption is not as bright as one might imagine. This ruling simply establishes professional guidance for companies and employees on how to tax crypto-based salaries by maintaining cryptocurrency status as an asset and not as a currency.

The published document cited the New Zealand's IRD commissioner, who has even made an effort to state that crypto is not a currency, not legal anywhere and even doubted its ability to be a store of value. According to Commissioner Naomi Ferguson:

“In the Commissioner’s view, crypto-assets are property. Crypto-assets are not ‘money’ as commonly understood (at least not at the present time). In particular, because crypto-assets are not issued by any government, they are not legal tender anywhere. Further, although acceptance of certain crypto-assets as payment for goods and services is increasing, they are not “generally accepted” as payment. Given the extreme volatility experienced to date, there are also issues around some crypto-assets’ ability to be a store of value.”

Not exactly the desired outcome we were hoping for from a government ruling.

What exactly is this ruling all about?

There are two main issues: salary paid in crypto and bonuses paid in crypto. The commissioner of New Zealand’s tax authority has been asked to provide guidance and issue a ruling on how remuneration paid in crypto should be taxed when received by employees as part of their regular payments.

According to the ruling, crypto assets that are part of an employees salary or bonus will be subject to pay-as-you-earn (commonly known as PAYE) tax or Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT). In order for crypto salaries and bonuses to be considered under PAYE, they cannot be subject to a “lock-up” period, they can be converted to fiat currency on an exchange, a significant purpose should function as a currency, or their value is pegged to one or more fiat currencies. Other types of crypto assets paid to an employee that are not subject to PAYE will be subject to FBT.

Is this ruling considered groundbreaking as far as tax authorities’ acceptance of employee payments in crypto?

Not entirely. The United States Internal Revenue Service published guidance in 2014, which detailed the following:

""Does virtual currency paid by an employer as remuneration for services constitute wages for employment tax purposes? [...] Yes. Generally, the medium in which remuneration for services is paid is immaterial to the determination of whether the remuneration constitutes wages for employment tax purposes.""

Nevertheless, the fact that the IRD published clear and detailed guidance to these particular issues signals that tax regulators are taking crypto seriously and know that it cannot be ignored anymore. The level of detail in this ruling is much higher than the ones we saw outlined in the 2014 IRS guidance.

Back in September 2018, a group of blockchain and cryptocurrency professionals and enthusiasts proposed a document for New Zealand’s IRD that suggests “accepting cryptocurrency as payment for taxes.” The proposal acknowledged the difficulty of liquify crypto to fiat as a tax payments barrier and suggested that crypto tax payments will encourage compliance. The recommendations also included tax exemption for trading crypto for other crypto.

Tax authorities now understand much more than the basics of ""crypto as an asset or currency."" They know exactly how it should be done in practice. Now, all eyes are on the IRS to provide its detailed clarifications, as it promised.

In a blog post published on Aug. 8, Coinone described nine criteria cryptocurrency projects should comply with in order to be listed on the exchange. Coinone will specifically consider such issues as sustainability of business models, transparency of governance, token distribution plan, vision and value, market size, use case, team formation, roadmap achievement rate and marketability.

Focus on the South Korean market

In detailing the criteria, Coinone stressed that a crypto project should have a South Korean market-focused business plan, since the majority of its users are local citizens. Coinone also emphasized that it thoroughly examines the organization of the governance structure of listed projects and associated risks.

Apart from that, Coinone says that it considers a token's future distribution plan, in addition to the project’s token issuance and circulation. Crypto projects also need to have a clear idea for what value they can offer compared with existing products and services in the market they are replacing.

“Since CoinOne generates revenue only from the fees incurred from transactions, we intend to list projects that can naturally generate trading volume as the project grows,” Coinone wrote.

Gradual expansion of services

The development comes in the wake of Coinone’s announcement on Aug. 7, in which it revealed a partnership with cybersecurity audit company CertiK and disclosures company Xangle to provide more safety and transparency for their crypto investors.

In April, Coinone announced its plans to expand with the launch of an exchange in Indonesia. The exchange’s Indonesian branch was initially set to support six cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC) and Quantum (QAU).",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/quadrigacx-users-request-details-on-how-ey-lost-103-bitcoins,"Users of now-defunct Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX are requesting further information concerning the recent loss of 103 Bitcoins (BTC) during the funds' recovery.

An unfortunate loss

As Cointelegraph reported in February, one of the Big Four accounting firms — EY (formerly branded as Ernst & Young) — was appointed by QuadrigaCX as an independent third party to monitor the proceedings in a creditor protection case.

Ey announced at the time that “Quadriga inadvertently transferred 103 Bitcoins valued at approximately $468,675 to Quadriga cold wallets, which the Company is currently unable to access.” Currently, the coins would be worth $1 million.

Industry news outlet Coindesk reported on Aug. 16 that — six months after the accident — the auditor has not yet given any insightful information concerning how the loss occurred.

According to the article, all the information disclosed came from the report released by EY in February, in which the company declares that the loss was caused by a platform setting error. QuadrigaCX creditor Ali Mousavi told the outlet:

“This sounds like gross negligence to us and many of us want to hold EY accountable for what happened. [...] Instead of giving us the details, they [struck] a deal with [law firm Miller Thomson] to keep the details confidential and [are] making it harder for us to hold EY accountable.”

Creditors want a different legal firm

Creditor Xitong Zou also said that “EY does not seem like they want to explain what happened when that’s the very least they could do” since “it was our money, after all.” He also claims:

“A lot of people want [Miller Thomson] replaced. [...] Although I don’t think that’s going to happen.”

EY has reportedly recovered about $25 million, with a judge awarding $1.6 million in fees and costs to all the firms involved in the case. The auditor also aims to raise another $9 million by selling assets of the exchange’s CEO.

As Cointelegraph reported in a dedicated follow-up piece, the crypto community has recently been actively discussing the fate of QuadrigaCX’s 30-year-old founder, Gerald Cotten, who reportedly died in India from a fatal disease in December 2018.

Recently, Cointelegraph also recounted the biggest alleged crypto heists.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/36166/an-alleged-cryptocurrency-exit-scam-swindled-2-9-billion-but-main-suspects-still-on-the-run,,2019-08-18 00:28:21+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-startup-monolith-adds-dai-to-visa-debit-card,"The Takeaway:

Monolith turned a $16.9 million ICO into $25 million-worth of assets by riding the bull market of 2017 then taking out DAI loans.

This DAI strategy is increasingly common among ethereum-centric startups.

MakerDAO and Monolith are now collaborating to connect DeFi loans to a European Visa debit card.

Ether fans can spend crypto with a Visa debit card because Monolith liquidates designated funds on the back-end, providing the merchant with fiat.

Monolith CEO Mel Gelderman told CoinDesk he wants to promote an “ethereum lifestyle,” starting with the way he runs his London-based token startup.

From his perspective, that lifestyle is about seeking financial solutions beyond traditional banks.

Since Monolith was funded by an initial coin offering (ICO) of TKN tokens that raised $16.9 million from retail investors in May 2017, Gelderman said his team turned the ICO proceeds into roughly $25 million worth of assets through timely sell-offs and collateralized debt positions (CDPs), using ether as collateral to take loans denominated in dollar-pegged DAI tokens.

“We’ve started to use the MakerDAO platform to hedge instead of selling our ether,” Gelderman said. “We’re deploying the economy itself to get [our goals].”

While a slew of ICO-funded startups ran out of steam in 2018 when the price of ether crashed, Monolith’s strategy provided the startup with plenty of runway.

The startup’s current assets include 80,000 ether (about $14.6 million) and a $10 million treasury of both 16 million TKN and approximately $3 million in fiat holdings. Lately, Monolith stopped selling and started collateralizing ether for DAI loans instead. And Gelderman is hardly the only entrepreneur taking this road.

Treasury management trend

MakerDAO business development representative Gustav Arentoft told CoinDesk he’s spoken with five startups, such as Axie Infinity and Balance, that have used DAI loans to help pay for office space and salaries.

Beyond MakerDAO CDPs, he’s also known startups that utilize similar loans from lending firms like Compound, which can earn 11 percent interest according to LoanScan.io. This buoys the broader system, at least for now, as people pay money back into these DAI loans rather than strictly liquidating DAI for fiat.

“There’s a lot of velocity of funds going back and forth,” Arentoft said.

He added that smart-contract-fueled services like Compound loans and Monolith wallets carry significant risk, because they rely on the security of that open-source software, rather than a custodial institution. As such, some entrepreneurs rely on smart contract insurance providers like Nexus Mutual, in case of a costly bug or mishap.

“I hope to see Monolith … become a completely decentralized bank, a decentralized card. Savings through Compound, lending through MakerDAO,” Arentoft said. “[Monolith’s non-custodial wallet] gives a little bit more freedom in terms of the regulatory setup.”

The regulatory setup is indeed the central question behind this experiment.

The initial white paper suggested Monolith, formerly known as TokenCard, would launch services in China and an automatic system for burning TKNs to cash-out a portion of the company’s earnings, held in an independent smart contract. Gelderman said the Chinese regulatory environment prevented the startup from offering products for that market so far.

However, Monolith worked with licensed Visa issuer and banking service provider Contis Financial Services Ltd to launch a working product for European crypto fans in May, a Visa debit card that allows users to indirectly spend DAI, ether, TKN, and several other tokens.

“We want to make anything in the ethereum economy usable in day-to-day life,” he said. “We’ve dedicated virtually all our money to engineering.”

The 24-person team currently employs 19 engineers, and their salaries are the company’s largest expense to date. Meanwhile, the global market cap of TKN has plummeted since the May 2017 ICO, with the token’s price dropping from $1.36 to $0.42, according to CoinMarketCap. Etherscan tallied a peak of 261 unique monthly TKN users in June 2019.

Next on the roadmap, Monolith plans to integrate various financial services, including loans and insurance.

“These are people who are super over-invested into this industry, that’s who we built the product for,” Gelderman said, adding that so far card users have conducted roughly €100,000 worth of transactions.

Indeed, MakerDAO’s Arentoft told CoinDesk his team is already working with Monolith to integrate optional collateralized debt positions (CDPs) into the wallet app.

“That turns the debit card into a card capable of credit,” said Arentoft, a Monolith card user himself.

Crypto debit

Although merchants aren’t accepting DAI or ether directly, Monolith contrived a way to connect the ethereum ecosystem to real purchasing power.

Users simply add tokens to the firm’s non-custodial wallet app and select how much of each they’d like to use to “top off” their debit cards. On the backend, Monolith trades those assets and puts the equivalent fiat value on the cards. Merchants receive British pounds or euros, depending on the jurisdiction.

As for the ICO token itself, small transaction fees are collected from Monolith wallet users and distributed in kind to TKN holders. An independent smart contract accrues those user-generated transaction fees, where token holders can send TKN for destruction (or burning). This means, for example, if a TKN holder burns 100 tokens in this fashion she might receive an equivalent value of ether, DAI and DGX, depending on what users spend with their cards. Gelderman said he expects usage to increase since the token-burning smart contract just went live this month.

“A dividend operates on a regular basis while our system destroys the TKN, so it’s a one-time usage,” Gelderman said.

Although some may view this as an asset where the user expects “entitlement to profit-share (like dividends), revenues, or other payment or benefit of any kind,” according to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority’s definition of crypto securities issued in July 2019, Gelderman maintains its “one-time” nature exempts TKN from this classification.

So far the Monolith team has built many of the capabilities described in the original white paper. People can also spend TKN using the Monolith debit card, just like ether.

“Most of our users were contributors to our crowd sale,” he said, adding:

“A year from today, someone should be able to cancel their bank account and get everything they need from the ethereum economy.”

This is probably best highlighted by the fact that after experiencing bearish conditions all through 2018 (with Bitcoin even stooping at one point to around the $3K mark), the digital currency market as a whole was able to swiftly regain its former momentum and make an impressive comeback.

Since 2016, a number of countries have either banned digital currencies altogether (such as China, Pakistan and Egypt) or have placed various legal impositions on the asset class (thereby making it quite difficult for people to facilitate their daily monetary transactions using these currencies).

Other states around the world have an open mind toward crypto and are currently looking to amend the way in which they regulate Bitcoin and its contemporaries in order to nurture the industry while minimizing issues related to tax evasion and money laundering.

Furthermore, members of the G-7 (i.e., France, Japan, Canada, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States) along with Australia and Singapore are reportedly in the process of creating a new crypto system that can help collect and share personal data associated with individuals who regularly make use of cryptocurrencies.

This new system will allegedly have its digital foundations laid by the end of 2020 and will be up and running a few years following that. Per a recent statement issued by the G-7, once the aforementioned platform is deployed, it will be managed exclusively by firms operating within the private sector.

Cryptocurrency regulations around the world

Here are the legal frameworks employed by various countries to either foster or curb the use of this ever-evolving asset class. Below is the map outlining the countries that have made an official outline of their stance toward crypto.

Countries that take up the middle ground:

United States

The U.S. is undoubtedly one of the global leaders when it comes to crypto adoption and use. As things stand, investors have the option of purchasing not only Bitcoin but over 45 other digital assets across the country. The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, has classified cryptocurrency exchanges as being “money transmitters” and are therefore bound by certain niche laws. In a similar vein, the IRS too has classified crypto assets as being property with value — and thus are taxable commodities.

The laws surrounding crypto differ from state to state, and even national-level regulators have varied opinions when it comes to how cryptocurrencies should be treated. For example, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers digital assets to be securities, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classes them as commodities (thereby allowing users to publicly trade cryptocurrency derivatives).

Last year, the U.S. Congress released a Joint Economic Report (JER) to indicate that within the next 12 months or so, the country will move toward a more streamlined regulatory approach to crypto.

Canada

Another country that is home to a large number of established crypto startups and business ventures is Canada. The global powerhouse boasts of two different cities that are considered to be Bitcoin hubs (i.e., Vancouver and Toronto) and makes use of its existing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing laws to govern this relatively young asset class.

The country’s legal system requires firms dealing with digital currencies to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).

Local banks are not allowed to open or maintain accounts for clients dealing with digital currencies (i.e., if they are not registered with FINTRAC).

Quebec’s financial regulator — the Autorité des Marchés Financiers — governs a number of local ATMs and exchanges in accordance with the Money Services Businesses Act, which requires money transmitters to verify the identity of their customers and maintain records of their client’s activities.

United Kingdom

The U.K. is widely considered to be a global leader when it comes to crypto adoption and innovation. And while digital currencies are not banned across the region, they are still not considered to be legal tender. Also worth mentioning is the fact that no value-added tax, or VAT, is applicable on the purchase of various cryptocurrencies across the U.K. Rather, a surcharge is applicable on goods or services that are acquired in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar crypto assets.

Any profits or losses incurred by investors in relation to their crypto holdings are subject to capital gains tax.

A self-regulatory trade association named CryptoUK is seeking to improve the U.K.'s existing industry standards (surrounding Bitcoin) by implementing a code of conduct that includes a number of niche provisions related to individual privacy, data security and AML.

Australia

The Reserve Bank of Australia seems to have an open mind toward the crypto industry — with the regulatory body stating that it does not prevent people from making use of digital currencies. If that wasn’t enough, back in 2017, the Australian government declared that Bitcoin would be treated like regular money and will no longer be subject to double taxation.

France

While the regulatory status of crypto is still quite murky in the region, France recently passed a bill that will see a new legal framework established to govern cryptocurrency operations — such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) — across the nation.

Germany

The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) classifies cryptocurrencies as being “units of account” that can be used for payment purposes. However, individuals/firms indulging in token purchases (for commercial purposes) need to obtain authorization from the regulatory body in advance. Lastly, BaFin prescribes a case-by-case assessment for firm’s looking to conduct an ICO — thereby indicating that it has an open mind toward such nascent fundraising methods.

A strong stance to forbid:

China

Early last year, China issued an umbrella ban on any crypto activities taking place within its borders. Additionally, there is also an access ban that has been placed on all local/international crypto exchange platforms by the government. According to Zhou Xiaochuan, ex-governor of the People’s Bank of China, local financial institutions have been instructed by regulators that digital currencies should not be recognized as tools for retail payments.

India

The South Asian country seems to have adopted quite a hostile stance toward the crypto industry at large — especially over the last year and a half. For example, India’s central banking authority, the Reserve Bank of India, issued a circular in 2018 advising all private banks to refrain from processing any crypto-related transactions.

Crypto friendly nations

Switzerland

The Swiss government has remained open to the idea of crypto/blockchain from the very start. For example, the local regime provides a lot of financial impetus (such as low tax rates, tax exemptions) to crypto startups looking to set up their operations.

Switzerland’s finance regulator classifies digital currencies as assets that need to be declared on one’s annual returns and are subject to the country’s existing wealth tax scheme.

Per a report released last year, the Swiss “Crypto Valley” (i.e., the canton of Zug) houses a plethora of crypto/blockchain-related businesses that are estimated to be worth $44 billion.

Malta

The small island nation does not have any predefined laws that directly tackle Bitcoin and other digital assets. However, a couple of years back, the country’s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, brought into effect an economic strategy that was designed to help lure more investments to Malta from all over the globe.

Related: Safe Space: A Guide to Special Economic Zones for Crypto, From China to Switzerland

Additionally, due to Malta’s relaxed tax laws, a number of big name crypto firms (including Binance) have set up shop in the country (primarily to bypass some of the legal hassles that crypto businesses encounter throughout most of Europe’s major nations).

Luxembourg

This tiny European country houses one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchange platforms — Bitstamp — within its borders. In terms of how cryptocurrencies are defined, the local government views them as “intangible assets” that are not subject to income tax until they are exchanged for fiat. Additionally, all crypto-related transactions are exempt from VAT within Luxembourg.

Singapore

The Asian powerhouse is known for its business-friendly, low-tax regulatory framework. In recent times, the Singaporean government has signed a number of laws that are designed to allow crypto businesses to flourish within the region.

Last year, the central bank of Singapore finalized the country’s new regulatory framework for payment services, which now includes cryptocurrency.

Singapore’s digital infrastructure is replete with a number of crypto and fintech firms that can help attract investors.

Belarus

Per a decree passed by Alexander Lukashenko — the president of the Republic of Belarus — local residents have the right to buy/sell crypto assets as well as create their very own digital currencies. Not only that, the decree also allows crypto enthusiasts to indulge in activities such as:

Mining of various altcoins.

Trade crypto assets in exchange for Belarusian rubles, foreign currencies or even other forms of electronic money.

In addition to all this, the government has exempt owners from paying any taxes on their crypto holdings till Jan. 1, 2023.

Some countries are ahead of the curve

While some countries are still struggling to devise economic frameworks that are inclusive of digital assets, there are also those nations that already make use of systems that require crypto service providers to be licensed by relevant local regulatory bodies.

Japan

In Japan, all cryptocurrency trading platforms need to be registered with the nation’s Financial Services Agency. Nineteen businesses have already obtained the necessary licenses required to commence their operations, whereas at least 110 more firms have expressed interest in registering for the same.

South Korea

This East Asian country is another example, with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) recently unveiling its plans to regulate local crypto exchanges by bringing them under a unified administrative umbrella. Also, South Korea administers its crypto industry by using a “real-name system,” meaning that any crypto user wanting to withdraw or deposit Korean won must be in possession of a real-name-verified account at the bank providing this service to the exchange. As things stand, only Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone and Korbit are providing the aforementioned services for their users.",,https://www.coindesk.com/fidelitys-charity-arm-has-received-more-than-100-million-in-crypto-since-2015,"Fidelity’s charity arm, Fidelity Charitable, said late last month that it has received more than $100 million in cryptocurrency donations since 2015.

In total, more than $106 million worth of cryptocurrencies has been granted to Fidelity Charitable since it first began accepting this form of donation, according to the firm’s annual report published late last month.

Year over year, however, the number of crypto donations has dropped.

In 2017, cryptocurrencies represented the fastest-growing asset type accepted by the firm, with more than $69 million in donations. The pace has slowed in 2018 to $30 million in donations, according to the annual report.

“We see cryptocurrency donations rise along with increases in the value of cryptocurrencies in the marketplace,” said a company representative.

Likewise, Fidelity Charitable marketing head Amy Pirozzolo, said now that cryptos are facing a downturn people are less likely to offload them as charitable assets. This is related to the diminishing value of tax deductions charitable donors would be able to claim.

Tax advantage

In opening the charity to crypto assets four years ago, Fidelity was attempting to capitalize not only on humanity’s philanthropic impulses but also real market incentives.

According to Pirozzolo, investors who donate their assets do not have to pay capital gains on them and can write donations off against their income tax. She said the firm even “encourages” clients to “give their most appreciated assets first… because it provides the best tax advantages for the donor and charity.”

It’s in this sense, that when looking for assets to add, Pirozzolo said the company often considers top performing cryptocurrencies.

“One thing we’re committed to is helping donors choose the most tax efficient asset to give to charity,” said Pirozzolo. The firm is “trying to keep its finger on the pulse” of the crypto market.

In the release, Fidelity Charitable also formally announced its acceptance of the digital asset XRP. The firm stated on Twitter back in May that it would take donations in XRP.

“The majority of our contributions to date have been bitcoin, however we have also seen growing numbers of donations in ethereum,” a company representative said. Fidelity Charitable also accepts bitcoin cash and litecoin.

While crypto donations have fallen in recent months, Pirozzolo said most of the charitable giving happens in the second half of the year.

Facebook doesn't plan to launch its new Libra cryptocurrency and a complementary digital wallet until 2020. But that hasn't stopped some startups from throwing their hats in the ring early.

On Sunday, Israeli developer ZenGo said a cryptocurrency wallet it rolled out earlier this year will begin supporting Libra. Since Facebook and its 27 partners haven't launched the cryptocurrency, ZenGo is letting users store a test version. The test Libra funds, unlike the version that's coming, don't have any real monetary value.

ZenGo

""Getting to know it early might spark some new ideas and give you a head start for when Libra becomes truly operational,"" ZenGo said in a blog post. You can experiment with Libra by going to your account tab in the ZenGo app, which is currently available for iPhone users. The wallet also lets you buy Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin with your credit card or Apple Pay.

Since Facebook announced Libra, the company has faced pushback from US lawmakers who are concerned that the cryptocurrency will be abused by criminals and negatively impact the US dollar. Facebook's blockchain boss, David Marcus, said in a congressional hearing last month that the social network wouldn't launch Libra until the company has addressed all concerns, but he stopped short of agreeing to a moratorium.

Facebook took the wraps off Libra in June. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Libra will be pegged to a basket of assets that anchor its value, so that value won't swing wildly. The Libra Association that'll manage the currency hasn't said what those assets will be, but it suggested they'd include major global currencies, like the dollar and the euro. The proposed crypto has been met with a chilly response from regulators and politicians around the world.

ZenGo will compete with a digital wallet called Calibra that Facebook plans to introduce in 2020. The social network, though, has the advantage of already having 2.4 billion monthly active users. You'll be able to download the Calibra app onto your iPhone or Android device, or add the wallet into the messaging apps Messenger or WhatsApp once it's released. The Calibra wallet will also work with other wallets that accept Libra. Users need to verify their identity by uploading an ID such as a driver's license.

ZenGo, which plans to release an app for Android phones, said that users can create their digital wallet by downloading the app and providing their email. You also don't need a private key, and ZenGo users scan their face to backup their wallet. ZenGo said it's a ""noncustodial"" wallet for Libra, which means you have full control over your funds instead of having to rely on a third-party.",,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/18/technology/terrorists-bitcoin.html,"“We are dedicating a lot of resources very specifically to this space,” Sigal Mandelker, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in an interview. “It is still relatively new to them, but I’m confident that we’re going to see more of it in the future.”

Cryptocurrencies are attractive to lawbreakers because they make it possible to hold and transfer money without a central authority, like PayPal, that can shut down accounts and freeze funds. Anyone in the world can create a Bitcoin address and begin receiving digital tokens without even providing a name or an address.

The online markets where Bitcoin can buy drugs are hosting nearly $1 billion in commerce a year, even as the authorities have shut down numerous leading markets.

Countries that are facing American economic sanctions, like Iran, Venezuela and Russia, have also taken steps toward creating their own cryptocurrencies to circumvent them.

Bitcoin has been slower to take off among terrorists in part because of its technical sophistication, terrorism experts said. Terrorist groups have also had methods of using the traditional financial system without needing Bitcoin.

Hamas, which controls the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza, has traditionally survived on hundreds of millions of dollars of donations from foreign governments like Qatar. The Islamic State in Syria subsisted on taxes and fees it collected in the territories it controlled.

But both organizations have seen their access to money significantly curtailed. Israel maintains a strict blockade of Gaza, with Egypt’s help, and Hamas has been squeezed over the last year by financial cuts imposed by the rival, Western-backed Palestinian Authority. And the Islamic State has lost most of its territory.",2019-08-18,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-most-important-aspect-of-bitcoin-is-the-separation-of-money-and-state/,"The Most Important Aspect of Bitcoin Is the Separation of Money and State

Many cryptocurrency supporters believe the technology allows for the separation of money and state in a manner that’s never been seen before. Governments inflict two forms of robbery against nonviolent citizens by forcing them to pay taxes while also stealing from them silently through inflation. Now there’s a wide array of digital currencies competing in different ways to help remove the parasitic behavior perpetrated by the oligarchy.

The Monetary System Designed by Oligarchs Penalizes the People

Most everyone lives under government rule and they are compelled to pay taxes and use the legal tender by order of their rulers. In most countries, everyone who has a job must contribute a portion of their earnings to the government. For instance, a portion of payroll taxes in the U.S. goes toward safety net concepts like Medicare and Social Security. 70% of an American’s income tax goes toward national defense, health care security programs, interest on the national debt, education, energy, and agriculture. A quarter of the funds go directly to the military and the average American family paid $12,000 in income tax in 2018. There are roughly 80 million households which means the U.S. government pulls in close to a trillion dollars annually from income taxes alone. That’s not counting state-funded lottery, road tolls, sales tax, capital gains, building taxes, business tariffs, property levies, and more.

Despite the fact that most of the safety nets and health care systems are in shambles, roads are filled with potholes, bridges are failing, and the education system is failing, the only thing that continues to grow is the U.S. military. Oddly enough, people still believe these fools know what they are doing. Not only has the national defense budget grown absurd in America, but the evolution of for-profit-prisons and the expansion of the police state has amplified significantly. Since 1776 the U.S. has been at war 226 out of 243 years or 93% of the country’s lifetime and American citizens have paid for every last minute. Governments have also created a monetary system meant to enrich the representatives and their close friends. Meanwhile, the money system is manipulated and inflated so badly year after year, the nation’s citizens are forced to accept more taxes. The fraudulent monetary system pressures them into believing they need more benefits.

Cryptocurrency Solutions Are Tools for Increasing Freedom

There are many countries with different rules of law, taxation, and methods of managing the fiat currency governments produce and most of them are very similar. Meaning when someone says “If you don’t like it here, why don’t you just leave?” that really only gives them the choice to be ruled under another oppressive system. So if leaving isn’t so easy, there must be a way to circumvent the system where governments have control of our money but we must pay off their debts. The U.S. was founded by principles against taxation but the biggest foundation was the separation of church and state. For centuries humans have been forced to participate in the monetary system controlled by politicians and the world’s elite. But in 2009, the year the Bitcoin network went online, the monetary game changed and people now have the tools in cryptocurrency to disregard the rule of central money management.

In the summer of 2015, Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees explained how we all learned 100 years ago about the separation of church and state. Voorhees detailed that at the time humans realized the practice was immoral and he believes that with the state currently having control over money the system today, it is rotten to the core. “[The state] could tell you what to worship and how, when and why — Somehow, society realized perhaps that it was unethical – that we shouldn’t permit control of something so personal and important to your life to be controlled by the state,” Voorhees told a crowd in Dallas that year. The Shapeshift executive added:

Money is absolutely as fundamental to our lives as religion, and for many people, it is far more fundamental to their lives as religion. It affects how your life unfolds. The choices that you make about money dictate the ramifications of your life and those around you. And so, to have an institution like money so controlled by a central entity — by a monopoly — is absurd. It is immoral. We should get rid of it.”

Bitcoin and a slew of other cryptocurrencies offer people a monetary system where there is no intermediary to trust, no middleman, and no state or corporate entity stopping you from transacting on a decentralized network. Instead of using fiat money which is predicated by force and violence, individuals and organizations can voluntarily choose to use a system that is transparent, permissionless, censorship-resistant, reliable, fast and empowering. Bitcoin maximalists will tell you that BTC is simply the only way to bypass the state’s manipulated monetary system, but right now there’s a wide variety of digital assets that can help achieve that.

Alternative means of circumventing the state like using precious metals can be difficult because the government has deep hands in these markets. Cryptocurrencies offer a high rate of portability and a way to hide money from agents trying to steal someone’s hard-earned wealth. With a cryptocurrency like bitcoin cash (BCH) for example, it’s possible to send funds across any border permissionlessly. An individual cannot hide a million dollars’ worth of gold, but can easily hide a small piece of steel with mnemonic phrase words etched into it and take things even further by memorizing the seed phrase. Agents cannot steal from your brain.

Like Many Ideas Before It, There’s Still a Chance That Bitcoin Could Fall Short of a Revolution

Cryptocurrencies are clearly tools that can be used to circumvent the state and these digital instruments could bring forth a new era of free markets. Despite the crypto enthusiasts who embrace the state daily and are literally begging for the institutionalization of Bitcoin, there are still thousands of individuals who participate in the crypto industry to promote the separation of money and state indefinitely. These people believe cryptocurrencies can empower the general population and not a group of oligarchs sitting on the hill. Libertarians and agorist philosophers who love cryptocurrencies don’t care about Bitcoin ETFs, Bakkt, and acceptance from congressional leaders. They care about separating the monetary system from the violent monopoly that steals from society every single day. In the summer of 2015, the founder of Defense Distributed, Cody Wilson, highlighted why cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could fall short of a revolution and fall victim to the same system we have today.

“Without a big expression of intentionality to what is considered not the polite things to do with Bitcoin — specifically money laundering, specifically private access to your coin, holding your own keys — without projects that express these principles, you have nothing of what you want with a revolution,” Wilson emphasized. “This leaves me to proclaim that most people involved with Bitcoin were not serious about that in the first place.”

Today Many Cryptocurrencies Offer a Road That Leads to Greater Freedom

There are now multiple avenues available for cryptocurrency users to circumvent the state’s control over money. Despite all the arguments and infighting within the cryptocurrency community, these roads toward freedom of choice are still wide open. If you find the idea of separation of money and state appealing but are relatively new to cryptocurrencies, it is well worth taking the time to read more into the subject to learn how you can wield these tools against the nation state for your advantage. If you’d like to participate in the counter-economy, you can also purchase digital currencies from trusted platforms as well as in-person using noncustodial, peer-to-peer marketplaces.

Silk Road launched in February 2011 as the darknet’s first bitcoin-based marketplace. Within four months, it would be the darknet’s most notorious site whose reputation extended all the way to the U.S. Senate. The origins of the drugs marketplace can be traced back further, however, to a philosophical thread on the Bitcointalk forum. It was only later that the significance of this thread would be fully appreciated.

‘A Heroin Store’

“As a Libertarian, the thing I love most about the Bitcoin project is the chance that it could be truly disruptive,” wrote early Bitcointalk user ‘teppy.’ It was June 2010, and Bitcoin was still very much in its infancy, with its potential use cases still being figured out. “I think that drug prohibition is one of the most socially harmful things that the US has ever done, and so I would like to do a thought experiment about how a heroin store might operate, accepting Bitcoins, and ending drug prohibition in the process,” continued teppy, before outlining his idea for how such a venture would operate.

The proposal was cautiously welcomed, with some users highlighting the hazards (“US government has endless resources and nothing to stop them from doing things they’re not supposed to … I think if it’s high profile enough you would still get busted somehow, something you didn’t think of”) and others elaborating on how it might work.

Although the thread was provocatively titled “A Heroin Store,” one user suggested a marijuana store would be preferable because “the risk of getting caught is much more calculable. Your clients are much trustworthier, and your competitioners are not as dangerous.”

A Framework for Silk Road

Although they couldn’t have known, the participants in the thread were brainstorming what would become Silk Road. From the use of Tor to the way packages could be shipped, it was all laid out. It is unclear if the discussion directly inspired Dread Pirate Roberts, or merely crystallized an idea he already had forming, but within two months of the thread appearing, he had begun work on Silk Road. On Jan. 29, 2011, user “altoid” posted a since-deleted response in the heroin store thread that read:

What an awesome thread! You guys have a ton of great ideas. Has anyone seen Silk Road yet? It’s kind of like an anonymous amazon.com. I don’t think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff. They basically use bitcoin and tor to broker anonymous transactions. It’s at http://tydgccykixpbu6uz.onion. Those not familiar with Tor can go to silkroad420.wordpress.com for instructions on how to access the .onion site. Let me know what you guys think.

“So here we go, first Bitcoin drug store,” replied one user. “We’re going into deep water faster than i thought then. I wonder how long will it take for govs to start investigating Bitcoin.” Five months would prove to be the answer, after a Gawker article blew it wide open. Adrian Chen’s article would go on to accrue 3 million reads and spark a DEA investigation into Silk Road.

Lost Innocence

In early 2011, however, the world at large knew nothing about Silk Road, which was still the preserve of a few libertarians and free-thinkers on an obscure forum dedicated to magical internet money. On March 1, 2011, new user “silkroad” started a thread to promote the anonymous marketplace. The site had only been running for three weeks but “I am very pleased with the results,” they remarked. “There are several sellers and buyers finding mutually agreeable prices, and as of today, 28 transactions have been made!”

In time, those numbers would swell to thousands a day, with the site eventually racking up 1.2 million transactions. The community spirit that characterized the Bitcointalk forum in those early days was readily apparent, as users filled the thread with suggestions on how Silk Road could be improved.

Meanwhile, in the original heroin store thread, one user wrote a prediction on March 24, 2011 that would prove prescient: “Everything … is easily traceable. Using normal mail, there is 99,9% probability you will be caught sooner or later. Actually, anything physical (leaving physical traces) or involving third person is easily traceable, because you only need to find weak link in the chain to find the seller. People are usually the weakest links.” He finished:

I hope silkroad realizes this, because if he doesn’t … sooner or later he will be caught.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Only a handful of hedge funds have invested large sums of money in the crypto universe. Digital Currency Group, likely the largest, has invested in over 130 crypto-related projects with an average seed round size of $3.24 million. Its subsidiary, Grayscale Investments, which invests directly in cryptocurrencies and digital assets, had $2.7 billion in assets under management according to its Q2 2019 financial report.

According to the 2018 Preqin Global Hedge Fund Report, the size of the hedge fund industry was more than $3.2 trillion. This shows that hedge fund interest in cryptocurrencies is very low compared to other asset classes. Even if a fraction of this money starts to flow into cryptocurrencies, prices can surge.

The physically delivered futures platform Bakkt is scheduled to launch on Sept. 23. Its arrival is expected to increase institutional flow into the asset class. It will be interesting to see whether the launch improves sentiment and provides a much-needed boost to start the next leg of the up-move.

LINK/USD

Though Chain Link (Link) only closed marginally in the green, it turned out to be the best performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. Can it build on its gains if the market recovers or will it also succumb to selling pressure? Let’s analyze the chart.

The LINK/USD pair has been consolidating between $2.0531 and $2.8498 for the past four weeks. This shows that buyers step in to defend $2.0531 and sellers stall the up-move at $2.8498. Trading inside such a tight range can build up energy, which will be released either on a breakout or a breakdown from the range. However, it is difficult to predict which way prices will escape.

If bulls push the price above $2.8498, the pair can retest the lifetime highs. Traders can ride this rally by initiating long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $2.8498. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $1.95.

Conversely, if the tight range resolves to the downside, bulls might try to hold the price above 20-week EMA, but if this support cracks, the next stop will be at $1.3139, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally.

LEO/USD

UNUS SED LEO (LEO) is the second-best performer of the past seven days. According to its plan to buy and burn LEO tokens using 27% of all accrued margin trading fees, Bitfinex tweeted that it had completed burning of 1750,570 tokens. Can it move up, building on this week’s performance? Let’s find out.

Due to a short trading history, we will analyze the daily chart on the LEO/USD pair. The bears broke below the support of $1.20 on Aug. 16, but could not capitalize on it. Buying at lower levels propelled the price back above $1.20 on Aug. 17. This is a positive sign as it shows that the sentiment is to buy on dips.

The 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has risen to the center, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. If bulls can breakout of $1.40, it will increase the probability of a new uptrend that can carry the price to $2. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $1.40 with stops placed at $1.15.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned out to be the third-best performer of the past seven days. Can it build on its strong performance? How does its future look? Let’s analyze the chart.

The BCH/USD pair has been trading inside an ascending channel. The bulls have defended the support line of the channel twice within the past five weeks. This shows that buyers are accumulating the cryptocurrency on dips.

However, if the price fails to sustain the rebound from the support line, it will show a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will then reverse direction and attempt a breakdown of the neckline of the developing head and shoulders pattern. If the price closes (UTC time) below the neckline, it will complete the bearish pattern, which will be a huge negative.

On the other hand, if bulls push the price above $360, a rally to the resistance line of the channel is likely. Aggressive traders can attempt a trade by initiating a long position if the price sustains above $360 for a day. The first target is $515.35, above which, the pair is likely to pick up momentum. The stop loss for this trade can be kept at $250. As the risk-to-reward ratio is not very attractive, keep the position size at 40% of usual.

ETC/USD

Ethereum Classic Labs’ Stevan Lohja believes that if Ethereum Classic (ETC) removes “Ethereum” from its name, it can “rekt” many cryptocurrencies with top market capitalization. Ethereum Classic Labs has started Studio, a program that will support and launch new projects to strengthen the ETC ecosystem.

The ETC/USD pair has been consolidating in a large range of $3.40 to $10 for the past ten months. Both moving averages are trending down marginally and the price has been trading below it for the past five weeks. The RSI has also dipped into the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the advantage in the near term. This increases the possibility of a fall to $3.40.

However, such a consolidation can sometimes be a sign of accumulation by strong hands. Therefore, traders can buy after the price bounces off the support at $3.40. This provides a low-risk buying opportunity that can offer great returns if the pair breaks out of $10. The first target on a break above $10 is $15 and above it $20. Contrary to our expectation, if bears sink the pair below $3.40, it will start a new downtrend, which will be a bearish sign.

BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain developer synfonaut has launched a consulting service called Office Hours, which provides an opportunity to connect with experienced Bitcoin SV developers for help on Bitcoin SV projects.

The Bitcoin SV pair has been giving up ground in the past few weeks. The bulls are struggling to sustain the bounce, which shows lack of demand at higher levels. The pair has dipped below the 20-week EMA, which has flattened out and the RSI is also close to the midpoint. This suggests a range-bound action for the next few weeks. Support for the range is at $107 while resistance is at $188.69.

If bears sink the cryptocurrency below $107, the pair will become negative and can drop to $92.933, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally. On the other hand, a breakout of $188.69 can propel it toward lifetime highs.

The best place to buy in a range-bound market is close to the support of the range or on a breakout of the range. Until then, we suggest traders remain neutral on the digital currency.

OKB/USD*

OKB, the native token of the world-leading exchange OKEx has been on a stellar run in 2019. Its rally from lows of $0.5718 to highs of $4.18 has offered a handsome return of 631% to its investors. That has easily outperformed Bitcoin’s 331.8% rally.

OKB’s performance has been supported by strong fundamentals. Hence, the pullbacks have been shallow, which show that investors are not willing to dump their positions and fresh investment enters even on minor dips. This outperformance has taken place even when the altcoin sentiment has been hugely negative.

The OKB Buy-Back & Burn Program is an attractive incentive for the long-term holders of the token. Migration of the token from the ERC-20 protocol to the OKChain mainnet in the future will also be a huge positive.

Following a new plan for OKB supporters, trading fees for VIP users will be determined only by trading volume, unlike the normal user for whom fees will be based on trading volume and OKB holdings.

Currently, OKB’s 24-hour volume is just over $92 million. Will the rally in the token continue or is it ripe for a correction? Let’s analyze the chart to find out.

OKB has formed a higher highs and higher lows pattern since the start of the year, which confirms that it is in an uptrend. When the uptrend is strong, pullbacks are shallow. During its latest pullback, it found support at $2.605, which is just below the 50% retracement of the latest leg of the rally from $1.2616 to $4.18. This is a positive sign and shows strong demand on dips.

The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the 50-week SMA has also started to turn up, which is a positive sign. A breakout of $4.18 will extend the uptrend and can carry the price to the lifetime highs of $6.68.

However, if the bears defend the overhead resistance at $4.18, the cryptocurrency can remain range-bound for a few weeks. It will lose momentum only if it drops and sustains below $2.3764, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally.

*Disclaimer: OKB is a featured cryptocurrency from one of Cointelegraph’s sponsors, and its inclusion did not affect this price analysis.

While there are not many things that everyone in the cryptocurrency community can agree on, there is a shared belief that decentralized digital currencies will play an integral role in the future of money. As a result, a handful of companies are building their business on products that aim to introduce Bitcoin (BTC) and the Blockchain to children as they will likely live in a world where these technologies will be commonplace.

In this article, you will learn about the two popular ventures that want to introduce cryptocurrency to kids and make some profit along the way.

Perhaps the easiest way to introduce money, financial responsibility, and saving to a child is through a piggy bank. For bitcoiner parents, there is now a bitcoin-equivalent thanks to the ladies and gentlemen at BitPiggys.

BitPiggys is a family-owned business that has made it its mission “to help other families start to save Bitcoin early in life, a little at a time.” The way they enable that is through their bitcoin piggybanks, approximately named BitPiggys.

A BitPiggy is a physical piggy bank that comes with bitcoin wallet to enable the youngster to start saving in bitcoin. Children can, therefore, receive part of or all of their allowance in BTC and send it to the wallet’s QR code on the BitPiggy. Parents can also load the public key onto a watch-only wallet for their little ones so that they can watch their savings accumulate.

BitPiggy uses OpenDime (a small USB stick that allows you to spend bitcoin) for wallet management, so a certain level of bitcoin knowledge is required on behalf of the parents to ensure that the funds are kept securely and are not lost due to inadequate private key handling.

The purchase price for a BitPiggy is USD 40.

Pigzbe is arguably one of the most notable ventures in the “crypto for kids” market segment. Created by the design minds behind Cubetto, a toy robot, and Kano, a learn-to-code computer kit, Pigzbe is a part physical and part digital piggy bank for children, powered by the token Wollo (WLO).

_______________________

______________________

The Pigzbe ecosystem is composed of an interactive app, a physical wallet device, and a native digital currency that enables learning, playing, saving, and spending. The idea behind Pigzbe is to offer children a fun, digital experience that teaches them about the value of money in the 21st century.

Kids can earn WLO by completing chores that their parents set them, they can watch their savings increase in value on their physical wallet or app, and they can play games on the educational gaming app.

Pigzbe managed to raise USD 8.82 million during its token sale in September/October 2018. However, the price of the token is down by 74% since its all-time high reached in February 2019.

Bitcoin children’s books

Beyond the small number of businesses looking to educate kids about crypto, there is also a handful of “bitcoin for kids” books with the same mission. Currently, you can find over a dozen children’s books on Amazon that are intended to teach children about bitcoin.

While the quality of these books varies greatly, there are a small number of bitcoin kids books with raving reviews that may be just what you are looking for to teach your little ones about Bitcoin, fiscal responsibility, and the future money.

Teaching your kids about crypto

Teaching children about cryptocurrencies in the context of money management, saving, and investing, and introducing them to blockchain technology has the potential to give them a leg up in a future where entire industries will “run on the blockchain” and decentralized digital currencies are a standard in payments.

Moreover, encouraging your children to put some of their savings into bitcoin could end up generating a respectable return on investment that has the potential to pay for (a part of) their higher education should they HODL until they finish high school and should the crypto market “go to the Moon,” as it is widely hoped for. (If it’s not, well, it might be an investment risk management lesson).

As cryptocurrencies continue on their journey to become mainstream, we can expect to see more and more businesses and individuals entering the Bitcoin education for kids market as there demand for this type of education is poised to increase in the coming years.",,,,

Another person has attempted to claim the title of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. According to a blog post published on August 18, this new person aims to expose his “real-life identity” through a series of written memoirs. The final ‘reveal’ will allegedly give the public the true answers to the decade long mystery. Despite the attempt so far, the cryptocurrency community is not buying the story and the huge effort stemming from the website, Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings, has been quite feeble. Some community members are not pleased with some elements of the story either.

Another Person Hopes to Convince the World He’s Satoshi With a Few Blog Posts

The latest person to claim to be Satoshi had published a slew of press releases explaining that he would be publishing a series of posts leading to the ultimate reveal. News.Bitcoin.com reported on the story when the press release came out and explained how most people assumed it was a marketing tactic to get people’s eyes on something else. It still might be a marketing effort or ruse of some sort, but the person truly attempts to claim the Satoshi Nakamoto monicker. In addition to the declaration, the person wrote a 3,300-word blog post about the origins of Bitcoin and his pseudonym. The post says it was written “as told to Ivy McLemore,” the PR team behind the so-called ‘reveal.’ It was also edited a few times since it was published at 4 p.m. EDT, when the word “cyberpunk” was changed to the word “cypherpunk” on two occasions. The blog edit was a pretty foolish mistake as the two words have different meanings.

The so-called creator of Bitcoin said he’s always been a believer in freedom and that’s why he began the blockchain journey. In the post, he explained that Hal Finney was his “closet ally and mentor” and the technology was not designed overnight. “Bitcoin was created through circumstantial requirements, but its current exposure cannot be attributed to design,” he noted. The author then veered off into a tone that’s similar to the Australian Craig Wright’s recent blog posts. The new Satoshi claimant said that the creation of Bitcoin led him to hide so he couldn’t be tied to something deemed illegal by governments. “At its conception, Bitcoin was worth mere cents,” the author remarked. “Later, when its usage was hijacked for illicit means, I made decisions and set off a chain of events to create distance between my creation and myself.” In order to further highlight the alleged misappropriation of the technology he invented, he added:

Today, when Bitcoin is understood by the advances of technology, but at the same time is being hijacked by greed, I feel I have a duty to work hard and make my creation better and take its vision to the next level.

After discussing the origin of how everything transpired, the blog post explained how the author came up with the name “Bitcoin.” The name stemmed from a Pakastani bank called “BCCI,” a financial institution shut down in 1991 by the Bank of England for money laundering. His father worked for United Bank Limited and he got a unique perspective of the banking system. The financial crisis of 2008 was the “final push for Bitcoin to be created” and he was also dealing with difficulties obtaining a bank account.

“I didn’t like the way banks controlled and utilised other people’s money and I wanted to at least try to change this. I felt like a failure and was humiliated by the banks so I made it my mission to invent something that would enable a common layperson to access money without involving the big banks,” the memoirs detail. The term Bitcoin came from the BCCI name, as so: “Bank of CredIT and COmmerce INternational.” The author also stated:

I wanted to empower the poor person, empower the little man, and create something that was accessible as the people’s money – the people’s bank with no boundaries, no nationalities, and no discrimination – where nothing was controlled by the government and where no one dictated and destroyed people for the sake of misplaced politics.

Using Hal Finney’s Good Name and the New Vision

The last part of the blog post is one reason why people didn’t appreciate this so-called reveal because it involves the now deceased Hal Finney. Using Finney’s good name to promote a marketing ploy would be vile and disgusting to say the least. Before explaining the alleged relationship with Finney, the so-called inventor clarified how Chaldean numerology was used to create his moniker and he emphasized that numerology was a way to encrypt many of the decisions he made during the development of Bitcoin.

and using hal finney death for a PR stunt is absolutely digusting ! — Xavier59 (@TheCryptoBird) August 18, 2019

As far as Hal Finney was concerned, the author gives a lot of credit to the renowned cryptographer and the man who received the first bitcoin transaction. He considered Finney his “closest ally” and referred to him as the “Steve Wozniak” of Bitcoin, which means Finney did a lot of the leg work. “I always looked at how it would be successful commercially with a vision to change the financial world while he looked at the technical aspects,” the writer expounded.

Of course, a good portion of the crypto community thinks the entire story is a farce and they believe this is just another “Faketoshi” trying to steal some thunder. The website BCCI’s domain credentials and the company registration show two people behind the business – Bilal Khalid, and Munir Aslam Malik. Both names are very common in Pakistan and the blog post notes that Satoshi flew to Pakistan regularly from the UK. The blog announcement also says he changed his legal name in the UK, soon after the technology was up and running. There’s not much information on these two individuals online, minus a few connections to BCCI and a few other domains. There are other websites that are connected to the BCCI name which include tdwnpro.com, 5ato5hi.com, insidecaf.com, and onlinemarketing.net. The domain “5ato5hi” shows a lot more information about this debacle as the website’s home page says “Satoshi Nakamoto: A Round Peg in a Square Hole.”

The website’s “about” section shows the business is awfully fascinated with the word “blockchain” and clearly shows the creator of the website thinks blockchain will disrupt “42 business verticals.” There’s the “Blockchain Operating System” which claims to be a distributed ledger framework that will become the “default operating system (OS)” for personal, business, and enterprise users. The associated websites and the ‘revealing’ story are all very tacky as all of the published material has been riddled with grammatical errors, misspellings, and using the word “cyberpunk” and changing it to “cypherpunk” after the internet called out the mistake. So far, many crypto proponents assume that the man who will step forward will be Bilal Khalid. “Hey Ivy McLemore, just so you’re aware, Bilal Khalid is not Satoshi Nakamoto. Have fun promoting his ‘reveal’ whilst your name gets dragged through the mud,” Monero’s Riccardo Spagni tweeted after the reveal post published.

No One Believes the New Satoshi But People Love Fictional Satoshi Stories

Of course, the latest ‘reveal’ got attention as people do love the fan fiction behind Satoshi Nakamoto stories. It’s safe to say that a lot of observers will visit the URL to read the next blog post installments which plan to publish on Monday and Tuesday at 4 p.m. EDT. The next post will continue to cover his strong belief in Chaldean numerology. But the second installment will also “reveal all facts” related to his alleged 980,000 bitcoins. People will have to wait until the third published post to find out his “real-life identity” and decide whether or not his claims are legitimate.

So far, just like the pushback Craig Wright has seen, no one considers this new ‘reveal’ valid. Bitcoiners think the website, Satoshi Nakamoto Renaissance Holdings, is simply a tasteless marketing ploy. A lot of people also think the author’s writing is not at all similar to Satoshi’s old posts on Bitcointalk.org, and the self-proclaimed Satoshi over accentuates a U.K.-based undertone and says the word “whilst” quite a bit. However, the website has been getting a lot of traffic. The site’s server was down multiple times yesterday due to a traffic overload after the un-edited version of the blog post published.

Three trading pairs go live

Confirmed in a press release on Aug. 19, Rakuten Wallet, which is a subsidiary of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, said spot trading of three cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) — was now live.

In future, developers plan to release an app for iOS and Android, use of which will be mandatory for deposits and withdrawals.

“Customers who already have a bank account with Rakuten Bank will be able to easily open a Rakuten Wallet account simply by entering the required information on the online application form,” the press release added.

Rakuten acquired Everybody’s Bitcoin in August 2018 for a sum of $2.4 million. Executives had originally announced the impending launch in April this year, but progress appeared to stall.

Japan’s cryptocurrency ecosystem growing rapidly

The exchange joins a rapidly expanding ecosystem on the Japanese market, with multiple competitors vying for a slice of the domestic cryptocurrency trade.

Last month, Tokyo announced it wished to create a cryptocurrency-based analog to SWIFT, the global payment settlement network, in a move subsequently approved by the G7.

The petition purportedly seeks to require local banks to disclose their policies on money originating from digital currencies.

Local news daily Globes reported on Aug. 19 that state banks are required to report reasons for refusing transactions to the country’s central bank, the Bank of Israel. The association previously reached out to Bank of Israel, asking for clarification on the cryptocurrency policies of commercial banks, but were reportedly refused.

Association chairman Meni Rosenfeld told Globes that the Bank of Israel recently refused the association’s request on the grounds that these are industry secrets. This apparently motivated the association to move forward with a legal petition to make the disclosure mandatory. Israel Bitcoin Association legal adviser Jonathan Klinger said:

""Under the Banking (Licensing) Law, it is the duty of a bank to state to the Bank of Israel the policy under which it refuses to conduct transactions. We therefore contacted the Bank of Israel and asked for this information, but the Bank of Israel did not agree to disclose this policy to us. We therefore decided to petition the court to force the Bank of Israel to provide us with a copy of the policy submitted to it by the banks.”

Israeli banks have reportedly denied the Israel Bitcoin Association the ability to open an account, even though the association does not buy or sell digital currency. The report notes that this is likely due to the association’s name, which includes the word Bitcoin.

Tax troubles and class action against Bank Hapoalim

Other traders and crypto-related businesses in Israel have experienced difficulties making deposits and remaining tax-compliant due to crypto-averse banking policies. According to some reports, cryptocurrency traders cannot pay taxes as they are unable to make deposits of funds obtained through cryptocurrencies.

The tax authority is reportedly aware of the problem, but does not act as, according to local BTC investor Ron Gross: “the ball is not in their court.”

Additionally, a cryptocurrency investor has filed a class action suit against the Israeli Bank Hapoalim, on the grounds that they will not accept money earned via BTC investments. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the complainant’s lawyer, Lior Lahav, has argued:",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-binance-announces-new-stablecoin-initiative,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has announced that it’s launching a project that will develop cryptocurrencies and digital assets pegged to fiat currencies around the world.

Dubbed Venus, the “localized” stablecoin initiative will see the firm utilize its existing infrastructure, such as its public blockchain, Binance Chain, and international payment system, “to empower developed and developing countries to spur new currencies.”

Binance said it’s seeking to create new partnerships with governments, enterprises and cryptocurrency and blockchain firms to assist the effort.

The exchange stated in its Monday announcement that it “will provide full-process technical support, compliance risk control system and multi-dimensional cooperation network to build Venus,” adding:

“Binance welcomes additional government partners, companies and organizations with a strong interest and influence on a global scale to collaborate with us to build a new open alliance and sustainable community.”

The exchange has previously launched two stablecoins, BTCB, pegged to bitcoin, and BGBP, pegged to the British pound. on Binance Chain. It also listed the USDC dollar-backed cryptocurrency back in November.

In a statement to CoinDesk, Binance co-founder Yi He addressed the new project, saying:

“We believe that in the near and long term, stablecoins will progressively replace traditional fiat currencies in countries around the world, and bring a new and balanced standard of the digital economy. We hope to achieve a vision, that is, to reshape the world financial system, allow countries to have more tangible financial services and infrastructures, protect their financial security and increase the economic efficiency of countries.”

Because bitcoin is decentralized, it's not directly subject to market forces such as interest rates or currency debasement.

Still, one expert explains to us why they don't recommend investors invest in bitcoin for that reason.

Read more on Markets Insider.

As escalating trade tensions between the US and China have whipsawed markets and stoked fears of an economic recession, some investors are seeing cryptocurrencies in a new light.

Bitcoin in particular has become more appealing to investors because it's not directly exposed to the political forces underlying market turbulence. Because it's decentralized and not dictated by a single government, it's not subject to the whims of a central bank or political leader.

That insulated nature helped bitcoin reach recent multi-month highs as trade-war turmoil sparked a vicious global equity sell-off. Put simply, traders sought refuge in the cryptocurrency because they weren't sure where else to hide.

""In a slowdown, since the global economy is so interconnected, there are only a limited number of assets that are isolated,"" Evan Kuo, CEO of Ampleforth, a digital asset protocol, told Markets Insider in an interview.

To that end, bitcoin is not subject to the same forces as normal currency. This is why people who feel less trust towards the government see it as an alternative, said Aries Wang, cofounder of Bibox, a digital asset exchange that uses artificial intelligence technology.

But there's a catch: bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are quite volatile. Take recent trading for example. Even after bitcoin soared above the $12,000 level on global macro fears, it has since fallen back below the $11,000 threshold.

Still, Kuo says that this volatile can be a plus, so long as it's not tied to the same forces driving stocks and bonds.

""It's helpful that it's volatile in a way that's not connected to other assets,"" said Evan Kuo, CEO of Ampleforth, a digital asset protocol, told Markets Insider in an interview.

""There's been almost 10 years of data to suggest that the coin has almost no risk exposure to precious metals, commodities, equities, currencies, and so on.""

Having an uncorrelated asset can be a good way to balance a portfolio, Kuo said. And he thinks, compared to other safe-haven assets, there's more opportunity to generate a greater return with bitcoin.

For example, he points out that an investor could have higher returns in bitcoin than gold, another safe haven asset that has hit recent highs. There's more risk involved, Kuo said, but that's worth it to some investors for a higher reward.

Countries experiencing currency issues have seen bitcoin trade at a premium on local exchanges, according to Daniel Dixon, cofounder of Interdax, a cryptocurrency trading platform focused on derivatives.

In Venezuela and Argentina, two countries where political tensions have led to inflation and poor economic conditions, bitcoin trading has picked up, he told Markets Insider in an interview.

The case against bitcoin as a safe haven

To be sure, not everyone agrees that bitcoin - or even safe haven assets broadly - are a good bet right now, even as uncertainty rocks global markets.

""They are collectibles,"" Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager of Valley Forge Capital Management told Markets Insider in an interview, referring to both bitcoin and gold. ""You are actually not buying any protection, you're simply speculating. To me it's no different than any other speculative activity in your life.""

Advertisement

Bitcoin has fundamental structural issues, he said, and one is its limited use today. Few would sell their house, car, or laptop for bitcoin he said. In addition, he thinks that buying assets that don't yield much in the way of returns is unproductive.

""You have to think about lost opportunity and lose buying power when buying gold,"" he said.

Even though US markets have been up and down as of late, he is still very bullish on equities for the next five to 10 years, he said.

The best strategy, then, is to ""hold, wait it out and have the long term view of the markets and the economy,"" he said. ""It's an exceedingly good time to buy into equities today if interest rates are low for the long term.""",

Rakuten, the “Amazon of Japan,” announced the launch of its new crypto exchange platform Monday, August 19, offering spot trading of crypto assets via a dedicated smartphone app. The e-commerce giant has been crypto-friendly for a while now, experimenting and investing in crypto payment systems since at least 2014, but with the launch of the wallet exchange service, Rakuten Bank users are now able to buy, sell, and exchange BTC, BCH, and ETH, as well as utilize fiat off-ramps to personal bank accounts. Other formidable forces in e-commerce are working hard to jump on board the crypto train as well.

Optimism for Crypto

“Rakuten” means “optimism” in Japanese, and with all the effort the e-commerce leader has been pouring into blockchain and crypto development over the past years, that positive moniker makes sense. With a market cap of $14.5 billion, over 17,000 employees worldwide, and $10 billion in sales as of May, Japan’s internet commerce behemoth is ubiquitous in the land of the rising sun, and elsewhere.

In a press release from Tokyo yesterday, Rakuten Wallet Inc., a subsidiary of Rakuten Group, announced the start of its long-awaited crypto trading app and exchange service:

Through the smartphone app, customers can make transactions for crypto asset trading accounts, such as depositing/withdrawing Japanese yen and depositing/withdrawing crypto assets, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year…Three types of crypto assets can be traded: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

The app features a multisig-based “cold wallet” for user funds, and “There are no fees for opening or managing an account, purchasing or selling crypto assets, or depositing money,” according to the press release. While the company uses the term “cold” in describing the wallet, it is important to note that the actual meaning here is simply offline storage, and as such security is not solely in the hands of the account holder.

Application Process: Convenience In, Privacy Out

For those applying for a Rakuten Wallet account, the process is pretty straightforward. “Customers who already have a bank account with Rakuten Bank will be able to easily open a Rakuten Wallet account simply by entering the required information on the online application form,” the press release confirms.

However, privacy-minded crypto users may find the application off-putting. Japan is arguably the world leader in crypto regulation and adoption, with rigorous KYC and AML protocols implemented industry-wide thanks to Japan’s FSA (Financial Services Agency). The veritable dating game-style personal quiz prior to signing up is reflective of this reality.

Applicants must answer several questions even after opening a Rakuten Bank account including private details relating to one’s job, purpose for opening the account, and income. They must also state how many years they have been active in the crypto space. This is in stark contrast to private, P2P exchanges like local.bitcoin.com, where the only thing needed is an email address.

Rakuten’s Push Echoed by Amazon, Others

Establishing the Rakuten Blockchain Lab in 2016 after an earlier investment in Bitnet, a wallet/payments software firm in 2014, Rakuten is no stranger to crypto. In terms of the breakneck speed proliferation of Japanese regulations and crypto adoption, 2014 seems like ages ago to most. The Tokyo-based company is not alone, though, with other movers and shakers in the industry having also been putting in the time and research, and now seem to be making plans to jump on board with similar projects.

An official patent document from May reveals that Amazon is researching Merkle Tree solutions to proof-of-work challenges for unknown applications. Though Amazon does not directly accept crypto payments like Rakuten’s American site does, via the integration of the Bitnet portal, similar developments may soon be in the works for America’s retail juggernaut. Already the Amazon Coin digital currency is a reality.

Rakuten’s CEO, Hiroshi Mikitani, announced in early 2018 that the company was working on its own crypto token, “Rakuten Coin” to be integrated with the extremely popular Rakuten points system in Japan. Currently these points can be exchanged for bitcoin via the Japanese site.

Amazon has further created a stir in the media in past years by buying up crypto-related domain names such as amazoncryptocurrency.com, amazoncryptocurrencies.com, and amazonethereum.com. While this could be simple brand protection, based on the company’s recent research and investments, real speculation does seem warranted. Especially considering that other companies on similarly herculean tiers of mega financial success like Walmart, Facebook, and Google are all investigating and experimenting with blockchain and crypto as well.

Japan Still Skeptical of Exchanges

Though the Rakuten announcement is big news for crypto enthusiasts in Japan, some remain skeptical. With massive losses of funds at Mt. Gox, Coincheck, and most recently Bitpoint, customer confidence in Japan-based exchange services has suffered. Even lesser known issues relating to regulatory changes have left a sour taste in the mouth of many. Tokyo-based exchange Bitflyer, for example, froze user accounts in 2018 with no clear notification, citing “general maintenance” and the need to comply with official regulatory audits. Some users had crypto frozen on the exchange for weeks, with little to no assistance from customer service.

Rakuten’s Positive Push

Japan’s troubles of the past notwithstanding, Rakuten Wallet is pushing forward, with its Android app already available and an iOS implementation expected sometime in September. The service is set to be available 24-7, 365 days a year, except for maintenance periods. Fees only apply for withdrawals of Japanese yen and crypto assets. According to the press release “The app also features many useful functions that allow customers to effectively manage their crypto assets, such as confirmation of assets deposited in Rakuten Wallet, the purchase and sale of crypto assets, and real-time chart rate confirmation.”

The optimistic foray into crypto is perhaps to be expected from the group that is already an online mall, credit card company, Japan’s largest online bank, and owns an actual baseball team. With Rakuten riding the crypto wave in the East, and spreading integration worldwide, it can’t be too long until other giants follow suit.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Marcus Aurelius used to say: Time is money!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, August 19 2019, at a price of $10,916. That’s a decent 5.46 percent increase in 24 hours, or $565. It was the highest closing price in six days.

We’re still 45 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $195,243,306,008. It now commands 70 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin trading volume

Yesterday’s trading volume of $16,038,264,603 was the highest in two days, 4 percent above the year’s average, and 64 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 330,310 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 1 percent below the year’s average and 26 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.68. That’s $3.02 below the year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 17,971 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.4 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.3 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $195 Billion, Wells Fargo has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 87.7 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $89,399 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 16,770 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 13.2 percent below the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.

Most popular posts about Bitcoin

Bitcoin has created a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart. A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a drop to levels below $10,000.

Bitcoin’s recent recovery from $9,467 lacked high-volume support, so a rising wedge breakdown looks likely. The weekly chart is also flashing bearish signals.

A high-volume move above $11,000 would invalidate the bearish case and allow a rise to $11,500. A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for a full bullish revival.

Bitcoin is losing altitude after rejection near the psychological hurdle of $11,000 earlier today, and may fall below $10,000 in the next 24 hours.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value rose to a high of $10,956 at 00:03 UTC today on Bitstamp, extending its recovery from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467.

The rise to $11,000 was expected, as the cryptocurrency’s hourly chart was reporting a high-volume ascending channel breakout or a bullish continuation pattern yesterday.

The momentum, however, soon petered out just short of $11,000 and prices fell back below $10,800 by 03:30 UTC. Another wave of selling hit the markets in the European morning session, pushing BTC lower to $10,550 in the 75 minutes to 09:00 UTC.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,690 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.25 percent loss on a 24-hour basis. Prices are still up more than $1,000 from the low of $9,467 seen on Aug. 15.

Investors have associated the recent recovery with Friday’s announcement by the Bakkt exchange that it will be launching physically-settled bitcoin futures on Sept. 23, with some believing the news marks a long-term bullish development for bitcoin.

In the short-term, however, there is a strong probability that BTC will fall back below $10,000, as the recovery from recent lows has taken the shape of a bearish reversal pattern.

4-hour chart

BTC has created a rising wedge pattern on the 4-hour chart, comprising converging trendlines connecting higher highs and higher lows.

The converging nature of the trendlines represents weakening bullish momentum. Hence, a breakdown is said to confirm a bullish-to-bearish trend change.

As of writing, the lower edge of the rising wedge is seen at $10,494. A 4-hour close below that level would confirm a rising wedge breakdown – that is, the bounce from $9,467 has topped out near $11,000 and the bears have regained control.

A wedge breakdown, if confirmed, would open the doors to $9,974 (horizontal support line). A violation there would expose the Aug. 15 low of $9,467.

The odds of BTC confirming a wedge breakdown in the next few hours is high, as the relative strength index has dived out an ascending trendline in favor of the bears. Further, trading volumes dropped during the recovery from $9,467, which usually happens during temporary corrective rallies.

Weekly chart

The 5-week moving average (MA) has crossed below the 10-week MA, confirming the first bearish crossover since February.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram continues to produce lower highs and is currently reporting the weakest bullish momentum in six months. The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) has also produced a bearish lower high.

BTC fell 10.49 percent last week, strengthening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the rejection above $12,000 two weeks ago.

All-in-all, BTC risks falling below $10,000 in the next 24 hours or so. The bearish case would be invalidated if prices print a 4-hour close above $11,000 on the back of high volumes.

That would signal a continuation of the recovery from the Aug. 15 low of $9,467 and allow a rise to $11,589 (resistance on the 4-hour chart).

Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all the rest are barely used as a form of currency, a store of value, a unit of account, or even as programmable money in today’s world.

Vitalik Buterin, the 20-something creator of Ethereum, recently spoke to Canadian outlet The Star to talk about what he believes will boost the adoption of crypto assets.

Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin on Adoption

The Canadian-Russian programmer, who has become one of the most well-respected individuals in the crypto space, argued that one of the main issues with adoption is scalability.

Indeed, at maximum capacity, Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second on the base layer. And while this isn’t necessarily a problem because of second-layer solutions (ex. Lightning Network), most retail users are currently only cut out to make use of simple BTC payments, and thus are bound by the 7 tx/s limit.

He's a pioneer in the cryptocurrency world. The researcher, programmer and writer is known for his work in developing the Ethereum platform and associated digital currency Ether. @VitalikButerin spoke to the Star about his cryptocurrency journey: https://t.co/vT0Qag2vE8 — Toronto Star (@TorontoStar) August 19, 2019

Ethereum isn’t much better, having a maximum capacity of around double that of Bitcoin. However, Vitalik and his team at the Ethereum Foundation and at other development consortiums are looking to fix this through an upgrade dubbed “Serenity”, which he says is “a way to bring technical improvements, like PoS and sharding, together to improve the Virtual Machine, Merkle Trees, the efficiency of the protocol, and a whole bunch of small technical things that you have never heard of.”

Scalability isn’t the only concern, however. Speaking to The Star, the coder wunderkind touched on issues with usability, account security, and privacy. Indeed, anecdotally, this writer has heard many of his friends and families touch on how crypto seems difficult to use and is plagued with constant hacks. Just look to the hack of the Ethereum-based DAO, or the theft of millions worth of Bitcoin from Mt. Gox in the early days of this industry.

But, to put a cherry on top, Buterin noted that even if you solve all the aforementioned problems, you’re left with one pressing question: how do you turn [the technology] into something people will use? In other words, if the technology is impeccable — easy-to-use, secure, private, fast, decentralized, etc. — how will you bring the public over to use, say, an Ethereum decentralized finance application or a Bitcoin-based Liquid Network altcoin for in-game purchases.

Other Crypto Founder Shares Similar Concerns

Vitalik isn’t the only prominent crypto founder to have recently touched on the issues with crypto adoption. Speaking with me in an interview in March, Charlie Lee, the prominent creator of Litecoin, explained what he believes is holding back widespread usage of these decentralized technologies and money.

Lee, a former Coinbase executive and Google engineer, argued that one of the primary issues with crypto adoption right now is volatility. He explained that “because crypto prices are so volatile, it’s hard for people to actually use it.”

He went on to mention the same issues that Vitalik touched on, saying:

Securing your own money is hard. There’s always a tradeoff between security and usability. So people are using exchanges to store their coins because they can’t do it themselves. It’s easy, but then you hear all the stories about exchanges getting hacked. And that really hurts adoption. So probably, we just need to work on having better, easier solutions that allow people to store their own money. That’s the whole problem really. So I think usability and user experience is really important, albeit it’s something that is hard to solve.

Security risks of reduced governmental monitoring

In an interview with Squawk Box on Aug. 20, Pompeo pointed out the risk of anonymous transactions associated with crypto, saying:

“The risk with anonymous transactions is one that we all know well. We know this from 9/11 and terror activity that took place in the 15 years preceding that where we didn’t have good tracking, we didn’t have the capacity to understand money flows and who was moving money.”

CNBC host Joe Kernen brought up the subject of Bitcoin in terms of terrorism and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Specifically, Kernen recalled a viral claim by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that cash is not used for nefarious activities as much as Bitcoin is.

When asked for his stance on Mnuchin’s statements, Pompeo appeared to support the secretary to a degree, expressing his hope that crypto and anonymous transactions will not become the norm since that “would decrease the security for the world.”

Equal regulation

However, in contrast to Mnuchin’s intentions to enforce strong regulations in the space, Pompeo expressed his vision of regulating Bitcoin the same way as all other electronic financial transactions.

Last month, a former executive at German multinational investment bank Deutsche Bank published an article claiming Bitcoin is a leading indicator of hidden geopolitical tensions.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-trading-firm-inx-hopes-to-raise-5m-130m-in-upcoming-ipo,"Gibraltar-registered blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused startup INX Limited intends to raise between $5 million and $130 million through an initial public offering (IPO), according to a document filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The filing reads that INX — which develops a regulated platform for cryptocurrency trading and an alternative trading system for security tokens — is planning to conduct an IPO of 130 million INX tokens. Investors who want to participate in the IPO will have to contribute a minimum of $1,000.

A filing with the SEC for a token sale of this scale, rather than an unregistered initial coin offering (ICO), comes amid increasing SEC prosecutions of ICOs deemed to be fraudulent.

$5 million or bust

INX wrote in the filing that it will not complete the sale of any INX tokens until it raises gross offering proceeds of $5 million within one year. Investors will have the option to pay for INX tokens with Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), while BTC/USD and ETH/USD exchange rates will be determined by Brave New Coin’s Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX).

INX is ostensibly planning to establish a security token as well as two trading platforms operated by its wholly owned subsidiaries. By the end of 2019, the company intends to receive money transmitter licenses or otherwise qualify to operate in eight U.S. states. The company also plans to launch a platform for trading derivatives such as futures, options and swaps.

Industry’s mixed feelings on IPOs

In late July, Cointelegraph reported that Chinese Bitcoin mining giant Canaan Creative had filed a $200 million IPO request with U.S. regulators. The IPO filing reportedly means that Canaan is the first Chinese market participant to successfully take its case to the U.S. market.

As the Wall Street Journal reported in mid-June, traditional exchanges are holding off on Reg A+ IPOs following problematic offerings like that of purported cryptocurrency firm Longfin Corp. Earlier in June, the SEC filed fraud charges against Longfin, claiming the company fabricated 90% of its revenue and sold over 400,000 shares of Longfin that it did not have the funds to back in a scheme to secure its spot on the Nasdaq.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/square-crypto-hires-blockstream-co-founder-open-source-bitcoin-dev,"Square Crypto, the cryptocurrency-focused branch of mobile payment company Square, has hired Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin (BTC) developer Matt Corallo. Square Crypto announced the news in an official Twitter post on Aug. 20.

Matt Corallo also commented on the announcement, saying:

“So excited to be joining the @sqcrypto team over the coming weeks. Experimenting with different models to accelerate Bitcoin OSS is awesome!”

As indicated in his Twitter post, Corallo is a Bitcoin Open Source Developer who previously worked at Bitcoin development company Chaincode Labs. Per his LinkedIn profile, Corallo has worked there for the past two years and 8 months. Additionally, Corallo is listed as the co-founder of Blockstream, a blockchain and Bitcoin development company where he worked for just under two and a half years.

Square Crypto’s teambuilding

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who also founded Square, is looking to build a small team dedicated to improving crypto infrastructure. The team will reportedly include one designer and a handful of software engineers, and all of their projects will be open source. Square Crypto’s first hire was Steve Lee, who previously served as a director at Google.

Square aims to develop Bitcoin infrastructure

In a recent Twitter “ask me anything,” project manager at Square Crypto Steve Lee emphasized that his team is particularly keen on developing support for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Lee wrote:",,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190820005442/en/tZERO-Crypto-App-to-Add-Ravencoin-as-Third-Cryptocurrency,"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--tZERO, the global leader in blockchain innovation for capital markets, through its tZERO Crypto unit, announced today its plans to offer to investors using both iOS and Android devices the ability to trade Ravencoin (RVN) on the tZERO Crypto app, in addition to bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), which are already supported by the app.

tZERO submitted the iOS version of its updated app to the Apple store yesterday and will be submitting the Android version later today. Once the apps are approved by Apple and Google, investors on both iOS and Android devices will be able to trade Ravencoin cryptocurrency (RVN) on the tZERO Crypto app. Launched on June 27, 2019, the tZERO Crypto App allows investors to buy, sell and hold digital currencies directly on their mobile phone, rather than using more vulnerable, third-party exchanges for custody.

“In addition to being one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, Ravencoin is philosophically aligned with tZERO in making it easy to digitize assets and make them freely tradable,” said tZERO CEO Saum Noursalehi. “Ravencoin allows for straightforward issuance and on-chain transfer of any digital asset, including security tokens, making support for RVN a natural fit for tZERO Crypto.”

Ravencoin is an open-source project designed to enable instant payments to anyone around the world. Its aim is to create a blockchain optimized specifically for the transfer of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, from one holder to another. In addition to supporting the RVN cryptocurrency, the Ravencoin platform can be used to build and support security tokens, digital collectibles, utility tokens, gift cards, fiat currency or other user-defined assets.

""Ravencoin, which was recently named the Most Exciting New Coin of 2019, first had life breathed into it by Bruce Fenton,” said Patrick M. Byrne, CEO of tZERO’s parent company Overstock.com. “It’s exciting enough that the tZERO Crypto app will let one trade RVN. In addition, Ravencoin’s design makes it ideal to be woven into our grander vision of a blockchain tech stack for society,” continued Byrne.

tZERO Crypto is committed to compliance and safety and utilizes biometric authentication for added security and ease of use. Investors will also have access to tZERO’s unique private key recovery system to restore their funds and cryptocurrencies in the event that they lose their private keys or mobile phone. The app is now available for download on both iOS and Android devices and the updated functionalities will be available once approved by Apple.

The Indian supreme court heard the case against the crypto banking restriction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in detail Tuesday. After many arguments challenging the RBI’s power over crypto were presented, the counsel for the central bank began making the case against cryptocurrency.

Today’s Hearing

The Supreme Court of India resumed hearing the crypto case extensively on Aug. 20, after hearing it in-depth twice over the past two weeks. Advocate Ashim Sood, counsel for the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), continued his arguments against the banking restriction by the central bank, Indian news and analysis platform Crypto Kanoon reported from the courtroom.

Sood brought up the crypto law passed in the U.S. state of Wyoming, the guidelines adopted by the state of New York, and the Howey test used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to determine whether a token sale is a security offering, Crypto Kanoon detailed. Sood went on to discuss the crypto regulatory approaches taken by the G20 countries, as well as the guidance issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to combat the illicit use of crypto assets.

The counsel proceeded to point out that the central bank’s claim that the effect of cryptocurrency on the Indian economy is negligible is not based on any study the RBI has conducted. Several past judgments were read out to the court before the counsel concluded his arguments.

Senior Advocate Nakul Dewan then began arguing on behalf of exchanges, starting with a brief history of cryptocurrency, Crypto Kanoon conveyed. Dewan proceeded to talk about RBI’s concerns, types of cryptocurrencies, and the advantages of blockchain technology in the banking and financial sectors. He also read out some parts of the interministerial committee (IMC) report. The IMC was constituted on Nov. 2, 2017, to study all aspects of cryptocurrencies and provide recommendations.

The hearing continued after a lunch break with many more arguments against the ban, Crypto Kanoon further reported. The counsel asserted that the RBI should put crypto under a framework to ensure compliance instead of banning, noting that the central bank had recognized that the crypto industry needs to be monitored to avoid tax evasion, AML risks, and a shift to the dark web. He further argued that the money deposited in a bank belongs to the depositors, not the RBI or the bank which is only a custodian of the deposited money.

The court then heard from Senior Advocate Shyam Divan who argued on behalf of the RBI. Noting that cryptocurrency is a means of payment, he claims that it has a direct impact on the country’s monetary and payment systems, particularly if more people continue to use it for this purpose. Further, its use for cross-border transactions is also a problem for the central bank, Crypto Kanoon conveyed. The RBI counsel read the budget speech by former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and cited various hacking incidents worldwide including one at Indian exchange Coinsecure. Before the court adjourned, Divan argued that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes, noting their price bubbles and the large consumption of electricity used in mining. The hearing will resume tomorrow.

Two Previous Hearings

Prior to Tuesday’s hearing, the Indian supreme court partially heard the crypto case on Aug. 8 and Aug. 14. On both days, Sood argued against the banking ban by the central bank, which issued a circular in April last year banning financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. The ban went into effect 90 days later, forcing a number of crypto businesses to shut down due to the lack of banking support.

Sood challenged the RBI’s power to exert such a ban, arguing that the aforementioned circular is not valid under statutes such as the RBI Act and the Banking Regulation Act. “RBI cannot step out of its powers as set out in [the] Banking Regulation Act. Therefore, its action against private businesses in the form of a circular is illegal,” the counsel was quoted by The Economic Times as saying.

After giving several reasons to invalidate the RBI ban, Sood began educating the judge on the basics of cryptocurrency and how major countries, including the G20 nations, regulate crypto assets. The hearing adjourned on Aug. 14 after the regulatory framework for cryptocurrency adopted by the state of New York was discussed.

Indian Crypto Regulation to Be Examined in January

As for the writ petitions concerning India’s crypto regulation, the supreme court is set to hear them at the end of January. On Aug. 8, the Indian government asked the court to postpone hearing these petitions until it has introduced a bill on cryptocurrency, which may be during the next parliament session in November and December. The court agreed and moved the hearing to the end of January 2020.

The Indian government is currently deliberating on a cryptocurrency bill submitted by the aforementioned IMC. The committee was headed by former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) Subhash Chandra Garg, who was recently removed from his DEA position and appointed to the Power Ministry. He subsequently applied for voluntary retirement.

A week before Garg’s removal, the IMC report containing a draft crypto bill was made public. The bill entitled Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency seeks to ban all cryptocurrencies except state-issued ones.

Following the public release of the IMC report, an increasing number of crypto industry participants have voiced their concerns regarding how flawed the report and bill are, calling for lawmakers to re-examine the IMC recommendations. The Indian crypto community, along with large trade associations such as the IAMAI and the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), have repeatedly said that banning is not a solution.

The Top Digital Currency Markets See Percentage Losses

BTC and a slew of other digital assets dropped significantly on Wednesday. At the time of publication, there’s been around $59 billion worth of daily trades happening between the most popular coins. BTC holds the top position and commands 69% of the $263 billion dollar market cap. At the moment, BTC is hovering at around $10,124 per coin and has an overall market valuation of about $181 billion. The top fiat currencies traded with BTC on Wednesday include JPY and USD and tether (USDT) captures more than 66% of all BTC trades.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) still holds the fourth position and each BCH is trading for $299. BCH has an overall market cap of around $5.3 billion and about $1.39 billion in trade volumes. Today BCH is down more than 5% and over 8% over the last seven days. Daily transactions (txn) this Wednesday have been around 43,000 and BCH has had an average of about 40K txn every day since April. BCH is the sixth most traded digital asset on August 21, just below EOS and above XRP. Tether (USDT) captures around 58% of all BCH trades which is followed by BTC (22.5%), USD (8.4%), ETH (6%), and KRW (2.5%).

The Verdict: Short-Term Crypto Sentiment Shows Extreme Fear While Long-Term Believers Are Still Cheerful

Despite the falling prices, traders and crypto enthusiasts on social media are still optimistic about digital currency markets and BTC prices. Popular Twitter trader Jacob Canfield says the charts look like a “pretty classic rising wedge that hit resistance.” “First support zone didn’t hold up price at all — Ideal buy zone $8900-$9100 if we can get there,” Canfield concluded on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Mark Mobius, the founder of Mobius Capital Partners, told the press this week that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are “psycho currencies.” “I call them psycho currencies because it’s a matter of faith whether you believe in bitcoin or any of the other cyber-currencies,” Mobius explained during an interview.

Meanwhile, traditional markets like stocks and bonds have been just as shaky and some people believe that institutional and retail investors are hedging macro risks with digital currencies. The Financial Times’ chief correspondent Henny Sender wrote a column for the Nikkei Asian Review which suggests central banks are pushing investors toward cryptocurrencies. “Central banks drive demand for bitcoin by devaluing their currencies,” the reporter detailed. “Cryptocurrency, wildly popular in China, is now a safe-haven asset.” Sender’s editorial continued:

Central banks have played a big role in driving this latest rally in crypto. That is because they have adopted policies which amount to competitive currency devaluations in the name of reflating their economies, in response to protectionist policies as the trade war leads to slower growth everywhere.

For now, BTC, ETH, BCH and the rest of the top digital currencies are feeling the pressure of weak hands, day-trading scalpers, and short-sellers. Even with a large number of optimistic hopium huffers on crypto Twitter, people are uncertain of what will happen next according to sentiment data. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which analyzes the emotions and sentiments from different sources and crunches them into one simple number, is low today. At press time, the Fear & Greed Index for BTC and other popular digital assets rests at “extreme fear” or #11. The index was in “fear” (39) yesterday, where it has spent the entire month.

After hearing the arguments against the banking restriction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in detail, the Indian supreme court directed the central bank to reply to the representations filed by crypto exchanges. Since the RBI has not adequately answered them, the court set a new date to resume hearing the case.

The Crypto Hearing Resumes

The Supreme Court of India resumed hearing the case against the crypto banking ban by the central bank Wednesday, after spending all day on it the previous day. Senior Advocate Shyam Divan, counsel for the central bank, continued to defend the RBI’s power to issue a banking ban. He started off by reading the disadvantages of cryptocurrency from the interministerial committee (IMC) report, Indian news platform Crypto Kanoon reported from the courtroom, elaborating:

The judge interrupts and asks how you [RBI] are concerned with consumer protection, it is not your concern. It is [the] government’s concern and not yours.

Divan explained to the court why a ban is appropriate, then discussed the IMC recommendations and various crypto warnings issued by the central bank. He reiterated the point he made yesterday that the ability for cryptocurrency to be used for cross-border payments could undermine the country’s monetary policy. The RBI counsel proceeded to discuss the use of cryptocurrency in illicit activities, noting its “anonymity.” He cited a July 2018 report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the May 2018 European Union directive.

India’s Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, the RBI Act and the Banking Regulation Act were examined. The counsel explained that the former gives the RBI power to issue policies to manage or operate its payment system, and regulate entities deemed a threat to it. The counsel additionally pointed out that provisions in the latter two acts empower the RBI to issue a banking ban.

The hearing resumed after a lunch break. Several past rulings were read out in favor of the RBI. After Divan concluded his arguments, the judge “asked the petitioners that RBI is an expert body which has taken decision on the basis of a study, who are we to interfere in their policy? The question is not whether it is arbitrary or not, but whether they can legislate or not when they are ‘satisfied’ under 35A” of the Banking Regulation Act, Crypto Kanoon conveyed.

Next, Advocate Ashim Sood returned to present further arguments against the RBI ban. He asserted that the central bank cannot take action based on the study conducted by others, adding that the RBI’s claim that cryptocurrencies are Ponzi schemes cannot be substantiated with data.

During the hearing, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman directed the counsel to the representation filed with the RBI by crypto exchanges, which explains that there is no need for a ban. Sood read out some suggestions given to the central bank by exchanges such as making the Money Laundering Act applicable to them as intermediaries with necessary requirements. The judge proceeded to question why the central bank has not properly responded to the representation. “You just said that ‘we are forwarding [it] to [the] government,'” Crypto Kanoon quoted him as saying, noting that he “Angrily says this is not an answer.” The judge further expressed, “Exchanges are not asking to uplift the ban but they are only asking you to reconsider. If you don’t give [an] answer to it, I will pass the judgment.”

Justice Nariman has deferred the case for two weeks to allow the RBI to respond in an appropriate manner, which the central bank has agreed to, according to Crypto Kanoon. The court is set to “rehear the arguments on 25th September, on the reply/ reconsideration to be given by RBI to the exchanges’ representations,” the news platform described, adding that the court order states:

After hearing arguments we are of the view that detailed representations by exchanges … have not been answered point by point, therefore RBI [is] to reply [to] them within 2 weeks.

Past Three Hearings & Crypto Regulation

Before Wednesday’s hearing, the Indian supreme court partially heard the crypto case on Aug. 8, Aug. 14, and Aug. 20. On Aug. 8, the court began addressing crypto-related writ petitions, some of which challenge the banking restriction by the central bank, while others concern the country’s crypto regulation. The Indian government asked the court to postpone hearing the latter petitions since it may introduce a bill on cryptocurrency in the next session of parliament. These petitions are now scheduled to be heard in the last week of January 2020. The court then began hearing the arguments against the RBI ban in detail.

The counsel for the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) was the first to present his arguments to invalidate the RBI circular issued in April last year to ban banks from providing services to crypto businesses. He challenged the power of the central bank over crypto at length. After the IAMAI counsel concluded his arguments, the counsel for exchanges began making his case against the RBI ban. When he was done, the counsel for the central bank started defending the RBI’s power to issue the crypto banking ban. The hearing lasted all day on Aug. 20.

There is currently no specific regulation for cryptocurrency in India. However, the government has been working on the country’s crypto policies since 2017. The aforementioned IMC was constituted on Nov. 2, 2017, to study all aspects of cryptocurrencies and provide recommendations. The committee’s report was submitted to the government in February and made public on July 22. Within the report is a draft bill to ban cryptocurrencies, which is being examined by relevant regulators, according to the finance ministry.

In June, Facebook made waves when it confirmed it was planning to launch its own cryptocurrency in 2020. Called Libra, the system will be connected to Facebook's massive user base, granting it the immediate potential of rivaling such established systems as Google Pay and PayPal. Indeed, Libra hopes to become the world's most widely adopted digital currency — sparking the kind of economic revolution that cryptocurrency has long promised, but has so far largely failed to deliver. Unlike other digital coins, however, Libra's main barrier to success won't be its technology, but its image.

The privacy concerns associated with Facebook, along with the general skepticism associated with notoriously volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are hardly relevant to Libra's platform and functionality. But that won't erase regulators' prejudices. Libra's ability to enamor and educate already highly skeptical and generally misinformed legislators around the world — and in particular, in the West — will mean the difference between joining the ranks of global currencies or sharing the same fate of other high-profile cryptocurrency busts that have come before it.

Libra vs. Bitcoin: A False Analogy

New cryptocurrencies are almost always compared to Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency that launched in 2009. And Libra is no exception. Each coin, perhaps to both their detriment, will likely always be linked. In reality, however, Libra has an entirely different structure and thus requires different regulations. First, Libra will be an equity-backed asset. This paradigm is getting somewhat more popular in the cryptocurrency space, as evidenced by the growing number of coins backed by precious metals. By being backed by conventional goods, such coins — known commonly as ""stablecoins"" — minimize the volatility often seen in unbacked cryptocurrencies (which currently dominate the market).

Unlike Bitcoin, Libra's blockchain will also be run by a corporate umbrella composed of payment processors, tech and telecommunication companies, venture capitalists, nonprofits and other cryptocurrency companies known as the ""Libra Association."" These companies will not only manage Libra but will also receive payouts upon the initial coin offering (ICO) and earn interest on its equity basket. But perhaps most importantly, the association will govern who can and cannot interact with Libra's blockchain — creating what's called a ""permissioned"" network.

A centralized membership body lends tremendous credibility to Libra's ability to control who is using the currency and how within the present financial frameworks. Bitcoin's blockchain, by contrast, is considered ""permissionless,"" which means there is no approval process to ""mine"" for the coin and manage its ledger. As a result, Bitcoin's public infrastructure is notoriously slow and inefficient because of the sheer number of people who are allowed to operate on its system at any given time, which increases the computational power needed to complete transactions. In essence, Libra is trading the conventional conception of cryptocurrencies for increased dependency, function and security, all of which on paper should create a far more accommodating regulatory environment.

The Rocky Road to Regulation

Libra has a strong interest in working with governing bodies, expressed both in its white papers and Facebook's decision to announce its currency without an actual product. Its success, hinges on ubiquitous acceptance. Ensuring that the proper systems are in place in key markets will thus be paramount to quickly secure the type of global traction needed upon its launch. While most punditry around the currency will be fixated on regulating privacy or its blockchain in general, Libra's exploitable points will be more standard financial measures. Simple regulations — namely, wallet or vendor restrictions, spending limits or international fees — could quickly sink the currency's hopes of joining and eventually disrupting the global economy.

Europe: Widespread adoption in Europe will be critical to Libra's long-term success there. To become a viable currency, the coins need to mimic the euro in that they cannot be immediately rendered useless upon entering another country.

Switzerland: Given their relatively small economic size and openness toward cryptocurrency, Switzerland is unlikely to restrict Libra's growth. The Libra Association will be headquartered in Geneva, which is fitting as Switzerland is one of the few countries that has passed coherent legislation for coin offerings. Under its current framework, Libra will most likely be regulated as both a payment token and a security token in Switzerland — placing it under the purview of the country's anti-money laundering and banking security requirements. Such regulations will not overly hamper Libra's use case and may, in fact, offer a regulatory blueprint for other countries. Thus, Switzerland will likely provide a welcome regulatory reprieve and home base in what is sure to be an otherwise tricky continent to navigate.

The EU: The European Union will certainly be involved in the political aspect of Libra because of its interest in setting standards for the Continent's emerging tech regulations. That said, the bloc has yet to pass any specific cryptocurrency legislation. Supervisory authorities have issued joint warnings, but have taken little concerted action beyond money laundering directives. This is most likely the result of cryptocurrency's clumsy fit within EU regulations. Resting somewhere between a currency, a commodity and a derivative, cryptocurrencies could fall within the confines of monetary policy at the EU level, or as fiscal and economic policy on the national level. An EU-wide decision on cryptocurrency would also require the approval of the bloc's 28 member states — an unlikely proposition on a generally low priority subject.

Germany: Specific regulation toward Libra is thus much more apt to occur on a state-by-state basis, which will likely make Germany the most important European market to win over. Home to Europe's largest economy, Germany wields tremendous influence in Brussels and often speaks on behalf of the entire European Union. But Berlin is also a staunch skeptic of U.S. tech companies — including Facebook — which may not bode well for Libra's adoption in the country and thus other EU members.

The U.K.: The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency-related technology, and was the earliest European adopter of PayPal's online payment system (which, at the time, was revolutionary in its own right). The government's relatively new cryptocurrency taskforce has named digital coins as a potentially disruptive field, but one still far too small to regulate. Until the U.K. cryptocurrency market grows to a size London deems worthy of oversight, the Financial Conduct Authority (the country's regulatory body) has been tasked with simply promoting general safety and prudence over cryptocurrencies, instead of imposing strict rules.

Such a lax regulatory environment could make the United Kingdom Libra's biggest ally. However, the country's past three years of political crisis surrounding Brexit has largely diminished its trendsetting influence. Libra's success in the country would nonetheless be considered a victory. But London's adoption of the technology is less likely to prompt its neighbors to follow suit — making it much less strategically important market to secure for the coin's European longevity.

Developing Countries: One of Libra's key use cases is providing a new and stable currency in under-banked areas of the world. Thus, while less influential in deciphering the global regulatory environment, developing countries will still be critical in securing the currency's long-term adoption.

India: India currently has the highest proportion of Facebook users in the world. And indeed, securing high usage rates and normative backing in such a massive market could catapult Libra's proliferation elsewhere. But capturing the imagination of the hundreds of millions of Indian users needed to do so will be easier said than done. In addition to having some of the most active measures against illicit use of virtual currency, India's central bank has banned regulated banks from trading in cryptocurrency. On top of New Delhi's cryptocurrency-adverse regulatory environment, the country's limited tech infrastructure further limits its prospects as a launching ground for Libra. According to a 2017 World Bank survey, the vast majority (70 percent) of Indians still don't own smartphones — meaning only 30 percent of the country even has access to the mobile payment technology needed to use Libra. In other words, before Libra can revolutionize India's currency system, a similar revolution in mobile finance would need to take shape first.

Brazil: When it comes to other emerging markets, Brazil is likely the next best bet for Libra's widespread adoption. Yet compared with New Delhi, the South American country offers roughly one billion fewer potential users.

The United States: But while Libra is not explicitly billed for the Western world, it cannot exist without its approval. Like any other commodity, the coin stands no chance of survival if it can't be traded for dollars or euros. Given the mix of legislative weakness and cryptocurrency-animosity in emerging markets like Brazil and India, Libra's future will largely hinge on its ability to win over the West — and in particular, the United States.

Although the European Union may be equally loud in terms of its political messaging around digital coins, the United States is far more equipped to deal with cryptocurrencies on a legal level. Washington is armed with arguably the world's most comprehensive regulatory framework, which revolves around the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC). But the overlap in authority among these three entities has led to more incoherence than coordination, evidenced by the fact that only one coin has so far jumped through all the hoops needed to register with the SEC.

According to statements released by the legislative and executive branches, Libra actually satisfies the majority of U.S. concerns. Its consortium construction limits security and identification issues, while privacy will naturally be less of a concern within a blockchain than with Facebook's social media platform. Libra's ability to communicate these intricacies, however, will be its true test.",2019-08-21 10:06:38-04:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/crypto-com-offers-100-million-in-crypto-insurance-through-global-firm/,"Hong Kong-headquartered Crypto.com today said it has obtained a policy of as much as $100 million through a global insurance marketplace that covers users’ digital assets held in their accounts with the cryptocurrency and payment platform.

Insurers gradually respond to crypto demand

Insurance is scarce for digital assets held at custodians or exchanges, but the insurance industry has gradually responded to demand starting with cover for cold storage.

Cryptocurrency wallets are attractive to hackers as they have a single centralized point of failure, making them prone to the same security issues faced by millions of web applications globally.

While traditional institutions are shying away from cryptocurrencies and related assets, blockchain security firm BitGo obtained insurance coverage from the prestigious Lloyd’s of London, one of the oldest insurance agencies in the world, with centuries of experience in this industry. However, BitGo’s policy offers a wider coverage against hacks, insider theft by employees, and loss of keys needed to unlock the funds.

Arab News reported on Aug. 21 that the ministry has identified a Singapore-based company promoting two fraudulent cryptocurrencies, dubbed “CryptoRiyal” and “SmartRiyal.""

Fraud alert: hype and pump

CryptoRiyal and SmartRiyal’s promoters are reportedly claiming that their cryptocurrency project’s ultimate goal is to finance NEOM — a smart city and tourism hub currently under construction in the north of Saudi Arabia.

The report cites an official statement issued yesterday from the ministry, which indicated that any use of the Kingdom’s name, national fiat currency or emblem for cryptocurrencies will be subject to legal action from the authorities.

In an interview with Arab News, cryptocurrency expert Dr. Assad Rizq said that many trickster firms are unregulated, have no assets and even copy their white paper from other projects. He added:

“They hype and pump their project so the price goes up. Inexpert investors, afraid of missing out, jump in, which spikes the price even higher. Then the owners sell up and make tons of money.

Dr. Rizq also underscored that investors should thoroughly research the technology and sector before investing and familiarize themselves with their country’s rules and regulations.

Bona fide state initiatives

While scammers may be falsely representing their alleged government ties, Saudi Arabia is in fact involved in a project to develop a cryptocurrency together with the United Arab Emirates.

Chaum plans for quantum armageddon

In a blog post issued Aug. 20, Chaum championed the new offering, Praxxis, which has seen a six-month development process.

The new blockchain follows on from Chaum’s Elixxir project, which debuted in September last year, and is intended to interact closely with its framework.

“The Praxxis consensus protocol simultaneously overcomes the scalability, privacy, and security challenges faced by legacy blockchains, the ‘trilemma’, to deliver the ‘purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash’ that Satoshi called for in the first few words of his whitepaper. And Praxxis currency is also designed to leverage the power of its sister Elixxir’s privacy-protecting platform,” the blog post explains.

Chaum is widely recognized as one of the fathers of digital money, while his efforts in recent years have become marked as separate from Bitcoin (BTC) itself.

Is there a quantum threat?

The focus on quantum resistance follows on from a previous debate about Bitcoin’s overall susceptibility to attacks from the new generation of hardware.

In 2017, commentators such as Andreas Antonopoulos broadly dismissed the concerns.

“It is certain that the NSA has already built quantum computers. Google has one in their data center, and if they have one, the NSA has one that’s ten times better,” he said in a Q&A session in March that year, adding:

“Do they use that to break Bitcoin? The simple answer is ‘no.’”

Chaum launched Praxxis in a formal setting on Tuesday at the Web3 Summit in Berlin.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/whats-driving-up-bitcoin-price-central-banks-says-ft-reporter,"The Financial Times' chief correspondent for international finance has argued that central banks can ironically be credited for igniting Bitcoin’s price.

In a column for Nikkei Asian Review on Aug. 21, Henny Sender said that banks’ dovish policies are spurring an increasing recognition of cryptocurrencies as safe-haven assets.

Hedging big macro risks with Bitcoin

Analysts anticipate more dovish announcements from the United States Federal Reserve at this year’s central banking meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week.

In July, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade, continuing the dovish tone set by the European Central Bank.

On Aug. 5, China’s currency fell below the watershed mark of 7 yuan to the U.S. dollar — and government bonds continue to be plagued by volatility, with little assurance of solid yields.

Against this backdrop, Sender argues that the actions of central banks in developed economies are turning Bitcoin from a speculative instrument into a solid investment that can help to hedge big macro risks.

She cites a report from Grayscale Investments’ research unit, which similarly argued that:

""Bitcoin has the potential to perform well over the course of normal economic cycles as well as liquidity crises, especially those involving currency devaluations [...] [it has] store-of-value characteristics similar to real assets like gold, with hard-money attributes like immutable scarcity.""

Indeed, Bitcoin’s increasing correlation with the precious metal has not gone unnoticed — yet further consolidating its moniker as digital gold. In the last three months alone, the correlation between the assets has almost doubled.

A perfect storm

In China, a government concerned about soaring capital flight considers cryptocurrency to be among the channels for such outflows. This — alongside other factors — has accelerated the People’s Bank of China’s decision to develop its own central bank digital currency, insider sources claim.

According to an expert at the informal Bitcoin Association of China, cryptocurrency purchases have shot up 50% in recent months, Sender notes — with the caveat that this figure remains difficult to verify.

Earlier this month, digital asset research firm Delphi Digital published a report arguing that central banks’ monetary easing and the increasing risk of fiat currency devaluation are likely to catalyze the price of both Bitcoin and physical gold. Macro factors are creating the perfect storm to ignite the coin’s price appreciation, the report concluded.

Anthony Pompliano recently stated that the European Central Bank’s expected dovish turn will be “rocket fuel” for Bitcoin — a view that is shared by those in the traditional financial sector.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kraken-crypto-exchange-to-add-support-for-bat-and-waves,"American cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is adding support for Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Waves (WAVES.)

While mainstream crypto data aggregators have been pointing to a dominance level of about 70%, analysts at Arcane Research believe the real level may be much higher.

Liquidity must be taken into account

Arcane Research has argued that, to get a more accurate measure of Bitcoin’s dominance, liquidity should be factored into the equation. They write:

“One might be able to sell one token for 3 dollars, but what happens if you want to sell 1 million? Without accounting for liquidity, market capitalization becomes a meaningless measure.”

Using trading volume as a simple indicator of liquidity — with the concession that a sophisticated measure could be constructed for more granular results — Arcane Research recalculated the volume-weighted market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market.

Its findings point to a new figure of more than 90% for Bitcoin — 20% higher than other estimates.

The researchers conducted two parallel analyses — one based on data from CoinMarketCap, and one confined to the 10 cryptocurrency exchanges identified by Bitwise Asset Management as having a reliable volume that hasn’t been wash traded or manipulated.

Arcane Research notably excluded stablecoins from the equation — arguing that such asset-pegged currencies do not compete with coins that have a self-sustained intrinsic value.

RIP altcoins?

The researchers claim that such an eye-popping level of market dominance makes it less and less likely that other cryptocurrencies can compete with Bitcoin. Network effects, they write, are all the more decisive when it comes to money, “where liquidity is everything.”

Such robust dominance has implications for investors and those developing infrastructure for payments, as well as for projects that rely on the underlying security of a public blockchain. This notwithstanding, the study does include the caveat that:

“It is notoriously difficult to compare and contrast different projects targeting different niches. [...] For crypto, one could argue that the whole idea of measuring the relative strength of different coins and tokens falsely implies a competition between complementary solutions.”

As reported earlier this month, outspoken Bitcoin advocate and former Wall Street trader Max Keiser recently commented on Bitcoin’s surging dominance levels — arguing that “the 2014-2017 era of alts and hard forks is dead.”

Bitcoin’s current dominance, as measured by CoinMarketCap, is at nearly 70% — a level not seen since April 2017.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrencies-used-to-buy-illicit-drugs-says-white-house,"The White House has issued two advisories to warn that fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are being purchased using major cryptocurrencies.

The advisories were addressed to financial institutions as well as digital payments platforms, and are designed to help them detect and report suspicious transactions.

Warning that the United States “is in the midst of an unparalleled epidemic of addiction and death,” the documents said:

“An analysis of sensitive financial data indicates that domestic illicit drug manufacturers, dealers, and consumers use online payment platforms or CVC to purchase precursor chemicals or completely synthesized narcotics primarily sourced from China.”

White House: Crypto used to pay for foreign drugs

In the context of the documents, CVC refers to “convertible virtual currencies” — particularly Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH) and Monero (XMR). Explaining how the transactions work, the advisories add:

“Individuals located in the United States search for fentanyl and identify potential websites that may provide the opportunity to purchase illicit drugs online. Foreign representatives will instruct the U.S.-based individual to send payments through CVC, such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, or monero.”

Financial institutions urged to collect crypto data

The advisories also note that “CVC transactions generate a significant variety of information elements that may be extremely useful to law enforcement.”

Financial institutions are being urged to collect these details in case of any suspicion, including “virtual currency wallet addresses, account information, transaction details (including [...] hash), relevant transaction history, available login information (including IP addresses), information obtained from analysis of the customer’s public online profile and communications, mobile device information.”

As Cointelegraph reported last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department wants to stop Bitcoin from becoming an “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.”

Previously, Mnuchin also stated that he shares President Donald Trump’s concerns that cryptocurrency is being used to finance illicit activity.",,https://www.coindesk.com/palestinian-civilians-are-using-bitcoin-more-than-terrorists,"The Takeaway:

Experts say Hamas is now using bitcoin for cross-border fundraising at an unprecedented rate. Still, even the largest estimates of terror financing in the region are apparently dwarfed by civilian bitcoin usage in the Gaza Strip, local experts tell CoinDesk.

General awareness in Palestine of bitcoin and ethereum has increased since 2018.

Freelance payments and remittances are reportedly the leading use-cases for bitcoin transactions in the Palestinian territories.

Ethical uses of bitcoin are more popular than ever among civilians in Palestine, sources have told CoinDesk.

“There are some offices that now do $5 million to $6 million a month,” freelance developer and Gaza-based bitcoiner Ismael Al-Safadi told CoinDesk about local money changers. “I’ve seen a local trader send 100 BTC in one [transaction]. … There are also a lot of small clients. They send $200 or $1,000.”

The $5 million figure dwarves the “tens of thousands of dollars” in illicit transactions reported earlier this week by the New York Times.

Last year, CoinDesk reported that one such cryptocurrency dealer served roughly 50 clients a month purchasing or liquidating an average of $500 each. He has since relocated to Europe, having earned enough to emigrate.

Yet two sources with knowledge of the matter estimated there are up to 20 bitcoin dealers now operating in Gaza. Since PayPal and other online services exclude the Palestinian territories, this is one of the only ways for freelancers to easily receive international payments.

For example, Al-Safadi takes more than 70 percent of his monthly earnings in bitcoin. Based on the social media groups he participates in, Al-Safadi estimates there are around 10,000 occasional bitcoin users in Gaza. Indeed, an anonymous source in Gaza who taught seminars about cryptocurrency to roughly 300 Palestinians since 2017, told CoinDesk just one such Facebook group focused on bitcoin has 5,000 members.

The teacher said there is a nascent interest in ethereum applications among Palestinians as well, both at home and abroad.

Another Palestinian based in the United Arab Emirates (who wished to remain anonymous) is developing an ethereum-based charity platform. He told CoinDesk the first pilots will distribute crypto donations to schools in both Gaza and the West Bank, aiming to reduce the number of Palestinian children unable to afford a good education. A test experiment began last week.

He said:

“People there [in Palestine] are starting to learn and ask about it. … Palestinians are more using bitcoin [than ether] … to make international transfers and to bypass Israeli control.”

It’s hard to say what the local transaction volume truly is, since the Palestinian crypto ecosystem doesn’t connect directly to banks or global crypto exchanges. Instead, much like the Iranian community in 2018, it is dominated by peer-to-peer transactions, private social media groups and unofficial dealers.

All Gazan sources agreed: most local bitcoin users are cashing out in fiat, not holding or using it for secondary business transactions.

Yet, perhaps as an unintended consequence, the teacher said that Hamas’s ongoing fundraising campaign to gather bitcoin donations from abroad for its military wing, the Qassam Brigades, has actually boosted awareness among the civilian population.

“Everybody was talking about ‘what is bitcoin’ then,” the teacher said about news in February, when blockchain analytics firms identified a Coinbase account participating in a campaign that garnered $4,000.

Hamas effect

Part cypherpunk black market, part terror-driven police state, the Gaza Strip since 2018 has generated a truly unique bitcoin ecosystem.

On one hand, entrepreneurs are using bitcoin in slowly growing numbers thanks to the high demand for mobile financial services. According to recent data from the Palestinian Monetary Authority presented in July at a fintech workshop in the West Bank city of Rawabi, 77 percent of adults in the Palestinian territories are unbanked even though 2.6 million Palestinians have smartphones.

Al-Safadi, the Gaza-based developer, told CoinDesk that Qassam Brigades operations are “secret” and not publicly related to the civilian bitcoin ecosystem. However, bitcoin dealers are now required to record the wallet address, amount and full name and ID number of every client for each liquidation for police records.

“Gaza works like a black market,” he said, adding he doesn’t know what the police do with this “surveillance” information.

Meanwhile, Hamas’s Qassam Brigades have stepped up their bitcoin fundraising strategy this past summer. According to the New York Times, the Qassam Brigade website now features a bitcoin tutorial and a wallet address generator to create a fresh account for each donation.

An anonymous source with knowledge of the matter told CoinDesk these donations have exceeded $12,000 so far this year. Another anonymous anti-money-laundering expert with knowledge of Hamas operations estimated the terror group’s bitcoin mining brought in $195,000 worth of crypto this year.

Such activities related to bitcoin are generally deemed non-compliant by local banks, as there’s still a longstanding rift between Palestinian political factions in different territories. A spokeswoman for the Bank of Palestine, which operates in both the Hamas-governed Gaza Strip and the Fatah-governed West Bank, told CoinDesk that the Palestinian Monetary Authority forbids institutional bitcoin transactions.

“We are not allowed, as banks, to trade with [bitcoin] or use it under any circumstances,” the Bank of Palestine spokeswoman said.

Regional censorship

Even with all these factors considered, most Palestinian sources estimate the aforementioned civilian usage far outweighs bitcoin-related terror activity in the region.

Most Palestinian bitcoin users are accepting bitcoin payments for freelance work, or remittances from family abroad, and cashing it out through local peer-to-peer groups. The UAE-based nonprofit operator said that, in an attempt to curtail terror financing, Israeli and American authorities sometimes interfere with bank transfers.

Indeed, in 2006 after Hamas rose to power, cash transfers to Gaza were temporarily halted across the board.

“The crypto market is promising in Palestine and has a good opportunity to grow there,” the UAE-based source added.

Both Al-Safadi and the local seminar teacher said they hope global exchanges and official banks will eventually allow Palestinians to transact with bitcoin through compliant digital platforms.

“Bitcoin has a unique potential, but it’s not a big potential. There are still many steps to be taken,” the teacher said, adding:

“In Germany, you have places to go to exchange bitcoin easily without extra fees and hustles … something like this has to be here in Gaza. If it stays between some IT guys and money exchangers that are willing to take risks, it stays like this.”

Ethereum classic and ethereum are enjoying a nice bounce ahead of scheduled hard forks while the bitcoin price languishes. | Source: Shutterstock

By CCN.com While the bitcoin price languishes this week, ethereum classic is enjoying a spectacular spike ahead of its scheduled September 17 hard fork. And the ethereum price (ETH) is rising too.

As of this writing, the price of ethereum classic (ETC) rocketed 20% to top $7.38 per coin. ETC has been on a sizzling rally for the past week.

Ethereum classic rockets 20%

In fact, ETC is the best-performing cryptocurrency today among the top 100 most valuable cryptocurrencies by market cap. With today’s surge, ethereum classic is easily outpacing the bitcoin price, which is moving sideways after plunging earlier in the week.

The price of ethereum classic rocketed nearly 25% to $7.82 earlier today — ETC’s highest value since mid-July, as CCN.com’s sister publication Hacked observed.

Atlantis, Istanbul Hard Forks Loom

It’s unclear what exactly is triggering ethereum classic’s abrupt surge. However, such sudden price movements often occur ahead of hard forks – even when they’re not contentious. ETC’s Atlantis hard fork is now less than one month away.

An upcoming fork might also explain the ethereum price’s Thursday rally.

While far more modest than ETC, ethereum’s 3% climb to $192.70 outpaces bitcoin’s recovery by a significant margin. ETH was up as high as $195.11 this afternoon.

The ETH network’s upcoming hard fork upgrade, Istanbul, is set to occur in October. It will involve six codebase modifications (also known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals, or EIP).

The Istanbul Hard Fork will be rolled out in two different phases. Phase 1 is tentatively scheduled for October, while Phase 2 will occur sometime in the first quarter of 2020.

Buterin: ‘Scalability is a bottleneck’

As CCN.com reported, Vitalik Buterin — co-founder of the ETH platform — recently warned that the “scalability is a big bottleneck because the ethereum blockchain is almost full.”

Accordingly, Buterin sounded the alarm on the need to upgrade scalability, saying doing so could bolster mass crypto adoption.

The 25-year-old tech entrepreneur also remarked that while bitcoin hogs up all the media attention, he says the disruptive potential of blockchain transcends bitcoin.

“Five years ago, the blockchain was just about bitcoin, but now it’s much bigger than just bitcoin,” Buterin said. “It’s split off into separate spaces that have a lot of different visions.”

Bitcoin is trading over $10,120 at the time of publication — a 0.08% price increase on the day. Hans Hauge, a senior qualitative researcher at crypto investment fund Ikigai, believes that BTC is still in the middle of a bull run. According to Hauge, the Bitcoin Days Destroyed metric — a measure of the time between movements of an amount of Bitcoin — shows that BTC is not yet at the top of a market bubble.

The number two cryptocurrency, Ether, is one of the higher-performing tokens on the day. At the time of publication, ETH is trading at $190.99 and has moved up in price by 3.52%. But on Wednesday, cryptocurrency investor and Placeholder partner Chris Burniske said that ETH is in a bear market right now. He appears to believe that ETH will continue upward eventually, and noted parallels to BTC’s price patterns. Burniske said:

“To objective observers, the network’s momentum was clear despite the bearish price action; those predisposed to dislike based on perceived vested interests, were blinded by biases & missed the bus. What happened to $BTC then is happening to $ETH now.”

XRP, the second-largest altcoin by market cap, is trading at $0.27 and has increased by 2.25% on the day as of publishing time. XRP was the target of a coordinated sell-off on the young crypto exchange Beaxy a little over a week ago. Beaxy moved to halt trading after XRP/BTC price plummeted to 40% of its trading value on different crypto exchanges.

One of the top-performing cryptocurrencies today is EOS. Trading at $3.63, it is up 4.05% on the day at the time of publication. EOS is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is a coin used on a platform of the same name for creating decentralized apps, also known as DApps.

The total market capitalization of the top 100 cryptocurrencies is more than $265 billion at publication time, according to data from Coin360.",,https://www.coindesk.com/pundixs-crypto-cash-registers-will-be-installed-in-49-retail-stores-across-venezuela,"Venezuela’s largest department store will install blockchain-enabled cash registers in its 49 retail outlets.

The megastore operator Traki announced August 22, it will integrate Singapore-based Pundi X’s point-of-sale device, XPOS, to offer a cryptocurrency payment rail for shoppers.

Already available in 30 countries, Pundi aims to sell 100,000 XPOS devices by 2021. This is part of the firm’s plan to introduce cryptocurrencies for everyday use, through an ecosystem of financial products like its XPASS crypto debit cards and Xwallet.

“We made the XPOS with the mission of creating real-life use cases for blockchain technology, and this couldn’t be better represented than Traki shoppers paying for their daily needs with cryptocurrency,” said Pundi X CEO, Zac Cheah.

Cheah continued to say that Traki has been an early adopter of blockchain technology in Venezuela.

“At Traki, we aspire to offer the most convenient options for our customers, and cryptocurrency has proven to be an effective payment solution,” said Michael Gomez, Chief of Crypto Assets department of Traki. Of Pundi’s near-300,000 wallet users, approximately one-tenth are based in Venezuela.

The XPOS payments system supports payments in a range of cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, Binance’s BNB stablecoin, as well as Pundi X’s own NPXS and NPXSXEM tokens.

A period of hyperinflation and lack of liquidity has seen many Venezuelans adopt cryptocurrency as a store of value and payment option. Last year, President Nicolas Marduro launched the petro dollar cryptocurrency, pegged to the South American nation’s vast oil reserves, as a means to sidestep economic sanctions. Maduro recently ordered banks and state-owned companies to use the token.

Swiss Info reported on Aug. 22 that the Zurich-based institution — which has $8.2 billion in assets under management but faces stiff market competition and an erosion of its margins — has opted to embrace blockchain to rejuvenate its business.

Bid to be “the go-to private bank” in Swiss crypto

In an interview with Swiss Info, Maerki Baumann CEO Stephen Zwahlen said that the bank’s revelation it would be launching a crypto business already signals a dramatic reversal in fortunes, adding:

“In our traditional business, we usually have to run after each client. It’s [...] rather rare for clients to just knock on our door. We suddenly had 400 people wanting to talk with us. And they were exactly the kind people we had been struggling to access for 10 years [...] they were typically between 30 to 40 years old, very well educated and with an entrepreneurial mindset.”

Zwahlen said that Maerki Baumann has “the ambition to be the go-to private bank in the Swiss crypto arena” — stressing that banking support for the nascent industry remains a fraught issue in the country.

“It cannot be that innovative Swiss companies have to go to Liechtenstein for corporate banking services,” he said. “Many of them represent a great opportunity to further develop our financial centre.”

Maerki Baumann’s initial focus — approved by its board in March — will be to offer business accounts and advice for startups launching security token offerings.

By early 2020, it aims to establish partnerships with crypto specialists to introduce outsourced storage and trading services for Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets.

Crypto expected to outstrip traditional business

The third stage of Maerki Baumann’s planned crypto business will be to provide advisory and asset management services for private banking clients who want to invest in new crypto assets such as tokenized shares. Anticipating great demand and payoffs for this new area, Zwahlen said:

“I would expect over time that digital assets such as crypto/blockchain might even take on a greater significance than our traditional private banking business, particularly in terms of asset growth.”

However, the CEO revealed that Maerki Baumann won’t be taking Bitcoin directly onto its books — noting that the bank always outsources trading, clearing and settlement processes.

In its regular mail out, the Weiss team is hawking a video, “3 Cryptos Better Than Bitcoin.” But you need to be a subscriber to actually find out what they are. Decrypt brazenly asked them to spill the beans.

Juan Villaverde, who leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers, began with a qualifying statement: “Our position is that there are several distributed ledgers (“coins”) that have more advanced technology than bitcoin’s. However, that may not necessarily make them better than bitcoin overall.”

So, perhaps, not better after all?

Villaverde went on to explain that the company’s ratings look at four major areas— technology, adoption, risk and reward in order to establish a rating. And, while Bitcoin leads in terms of adoption, currently other distributed ledgers merit higher technology scores. Those two projects are Fantom, a distributed ledger platform based on DAG—Directed Acyclic Graph—technology (which is also used by IOTA and Hedera Hashgraph) and Cardano, a smart-contract platform that aspires to be a new and improved version of Ethereum.

Here’s a deeper dive into the sea of tech that Weiss navigated in order to reach its decision about why, on the technological front at least, they trump Bitcoin.

Fantom

Fantom, says Villaverde, “is pioneering a novel way to reach consensus in a distributed network.” To further elucidate, he pointed us to the company’s recent review of the cryptocurrency it sent out to paid subscribers.

Weiss claims that the project is “blazing a new trail that could substantially change the way distributed ledgers are built in the future,” and many features it already incorporates are only now starting to be researched by major competitors such as Ethereum or EOS.

Fantom is a proof-of-stake blockchain, employing a Practical byzantine-fault-tolerant-derived (pBFT) consensus mechanism, an optimization of the original solution. (For more on pBFT, see here.)

According to its review, what particularly impresses Weiss about Fantom are two factors connected with this technology.

The first is “finality in transactions.” With cryptos like Bitcoin, while the likelihood that a transaction will be reversed is small, “no transaction is ever irreversibly final,” says the Weiss review. By contrast, once Fantom approves a transaction, it's final and irreversible.

Secondly, Fantom makes it possible to perform multiple simultaneous transactions, whereas on conventional blockchains like Bitcoin, only one new block can be written at a time. This, explains the Weiss review, creates a bottleneck.

“On Fantom, multiple new transactions can be written simultaneously by multiple validators. This gives it the potential for formidable processing speed,” says the review, while also allowing for increased decentralization and therefore better security.

Fantom is also built to easily handle Ethereum-style smart contracts, “but without any of the bottlenecks and other limitations that have famously plagued Ethereum,” adds the review.

In essence, the Fantom protocol allows—and even encourages—validators to produce as many blocks they can, as fast as they can. The only real limit is the volume of transactions submitted by users on the network.

But while multiple blocks are formed, “signed” with the amount of Fantom’s native tokens (FTM) that the validator holds, and information shared, the only transaction information shared by all network participants is contained in Fantom’s so-called “Main Chain.” It’s comprised of so-called “super-blocks” (termed “Atropos”) that are signed by two-thirds of the FTM (the holdings of those “signing” must amount to at least two thirds of the total currency held) that's been staked in the Fantom system.

It’s this feature, in particular, that Weiss believes “creates the potential for a breakthrough competitive advantage: It allows the network to execute different processes in parallel. It opens the door to division of labor. And it makes it possible for certain groups of validators to specialize in processing different types of transactions.”

Weiss points out that the technology, while promising much, is still largely experimental, which means that roadblocks and limitations are, as yet, hard to spot. But it adds that the team are offering rewards to anyone who can hack the system, to bring flaws to the surface prior to the launch of the Mainnet.

However, there is one area where the project is vulnerable, says the review: low adoption, and a correspondingly low market cap, which increases its vulnerability to attack.

Cardano

“Cardano, has always impressed us with the high quality of all the elements that contribute to a robust Proof-of-Stake blockchain-based ledger,” Villaverde told Decrypt.

Weiss provided us with its review of the project. Cardano, it says, is “one of the most complex of all the cryptos.” But, “what most sets it apart from the crowd is the way developers are going about building it out.”

The Cardano team, according to the review, avoid hype; submit serious conference papers and get them peer-reviewed; upload detailed videos on how each new feature is to be implemented, clearly disclosing any challenges, and provide an ETA for actual deployment on the live network.

This attention to detail, and getting things right before putting them live, is welcomed by Weiss as becoming of a platform that “aspires to provide critical infrastructure to the global financial system.” It’s in sharp contrast to the fast-and-loose mentality of most of the crypto industry, says the review.

Virtually everything about Cardano is of much higher quality than other cryptocurrencies, and that includes the top-level mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists working on the project, says the review “No other crypto we know of comes close to marshalling the same level of brain power.”

Weiss believes the Cardano team have taken the original delegated Proof-of-Stake concept and improved it.

For instance on Cardano and unlike EOS, voting is incentivized and rewarded with newly minted cryptocurrency. Participants can also pool their stakes to run a validator and then split the profits proportionately among themselves.

The review also contends that Cardano has improved on Ethereum-style smart contracts by completely separating them from the ledger's all-important “settlement layer.” This, it says, means the system is simpler and more robust and “almost crash-proof.”

The ratings agency points out that it has only seen preliminary information on the project’s governance, “but what we’ve seen looks encouraging,” it adds, with positives including staged voting and guaranteed secrecy.

The modular design of the protocol is also praised, with advantages that include freedom for developers to innovate securely.

But, naturally, such high standards have a flip side, and the review highlights three of Cardano’s current challenges: usage is low—the ledger presently runs a mere 3,000 transactions per day; a speed of only 250 transactions per second makes Cardano ""one of the slower Proof-of-Stake ledgers” and the network is centralized—the founding company, for now, controls all the nodes, so it can’t really even call itself a distributed ledger.

Weiss also highlights Cardano’s poor price performance but insists that its token, ADA “still holds its head above average. And with improving prices, could merit an upgrade in the near future—a testament to the technology and development team.”

Where’s number three?

The eagle-eyed will have spotted that the Weiss video is titled “3 Cryptos Better Than Bitcoin,” so what’s the third? We’re not sure, as Weiss plans to release that information to paid subscribers first.

One currency we’re certain it’s not is Nano. The rating agency’s less than complimentary review of the project recently caused it to come under fire from the Nano community (Weiss published a post with its response.)

In that light, Villaverde’s qualifying remarks, before he answered our question, would seem perfectly sensible.

Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology have become mainstream terms and are now featured in most dictionaries. Crypto-related terms have a lot of value when they are tethered to a web domain, and these days digital currency domains are prime real estate, with some selling for up to seven figures.

Crypto Domains Are Being Snatched Up, Squatted and Sold for Profit

Cryptocurrencies have been around for 10 years now and the entire ecosystem is worth more than $250 billion. The many tentacles of the crypto industry have grown thanks to third-party platforms, competing blockchain projects, exchanges and brokerage services, wallets, and payment processors. Each of these projects and businesses has a unique web domain and some of the top bitcoin and blockchain websites are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars – and even millions in a few cases.

Desirable crypto domains include Blockchain.com, Bitcoin.com, Ethereum.com, Crypto.com, Btc.com, and Bitcoin.org. A rough estimate of how much one of these sites is worth can be seen by referencing a domain value calculator. However, that doesn’t mean the owner will be willing to part with the domain at that price; these tools only give a ballpark figure based on traffic scores and ratings from Alexa and Google. For example, the owner of Ethereum.com has left a message for the website’s visitors.

“Ethereum.com was registered on March 11, 2011. It has no relation to the blockchain technology, which later adopted the same name,” the website explains. “Ethereum.com is for sale for $10,000,000 USD.”

Apparently, the person who registered the Ethereum.com domain just happened upon an internet gold mine, but there are many individuals and businesses who register a domain with the intention of selling it later for a profit. Ever since web domains have been tradable, ‘domain squatting’ has been prevalent. This involves a person buying up a bunch of website names that are tied to a specific product or industry and then waiting for a more profitable time to sell them. In the crypto industry, domain squatters are prevalent and individuals and businesses of all sizes have to deal with the pressure of people snatching up the best domain names early. Because of the rising popularity of digital assets, especially after the bull run in 2017, crypto and blockchain-related websites are selling or have been sold for top dollar.

Observers Witnessed the Crypto Domain Price Peak in 2017

In 2009, the website Eth.com sold for just under $20K to a company which held it until 2013 when the subsequent owner used a Whois history privacy protection plan. Then in October 2017, the site was sold for $2 million and the website is now dedicated to ethereum mining. A few months beforehand, in April, the website Cryptobank.com was sold to Craig Ellis, the cofounder of Triangl, but the site is still undeveloped. Allegedly in 2018, Binance purchased the domain Cryptoworld.com from Mike Mann, the founder of Domainmarket.com, for $195,000. At the time, Mann told the world that he purchased the domain for only $11 back in 2011. In 2017, Globalcoin.com sold to someone from Shanghai, China for $35,516 and in January 2018, Cryptotrading.com was sold to William Thomas for $35,000.

There’s a large list of cryptocurrency-related domains for sale today for thousands of dollars on various marketplaces. This includes Bitcointransfer.co ($12,000), Coinsbio.com ($1,000), 360crypto.com ($30,000), Block-chain.com.de ($20,000), Btcwallet.club ($10,000), and Tokenpay.es ($12,000). On Twitter there are also many individuals selling cryptocurrency domains and these days it’s hard not to stumble upon some shilling their domains. One person on Twitter explains the domain name Coinistical.com is a “fantastic brandable domain that’s for sale now.” Another person writes: “The domain name Bitcazino.com is for sale — A fun take on the words ‘bitcoin’ and ‘casino.’” The account @Dotonlydomains, a business that sells dotcom website names only, is also selling the domain Realcryptocurrency.com.

Cryptocurrency-Related Website Sales Are on the Rise Again

Searching through the depths of social media and digital currency forums shows that the crypto domain real estate market is in high tempo. Search results from Namebio suggest a lot of websites associated with crypto names have been sold over the last few months. Cryptocpa.com sold for $12,000, Owncoin.com ($2,050), Cryptofocus.com ($1,155), Bitcoin.red ($4,860), Bituniverse.com ($3,156) and Coinpig.com ($1,225).

Just the other day, Runsonripple.com sold for $10,000, Bitsec.com was purchased for $4,550, and Cryptoman.com was sold by Namejet for $1,350. The average selling price for a digital currency styled domain name was around $1,057 on August 18. Between September and November 2017, domain names involving crypto could range between $2,000 to $4,000 and on October 22 average prices touched a high of $75,000. The most active website brokerage service which has sold the largest number of digital currency domains today is Go Daddy.

With the popularity of digital currencies growing, the domain names attached to this industry will follow the same path. Squatters are gambling as well because they don’t know if that specific name will be a good internet brand and one that will entice a future buyer. On the forum Namepros.com, a marketplace where people buy and trade popular domain names, one user explained that digital currency domains are following market prices.

“The overall momentum in the crypto market has changed from bearish to bullish and we can expect to see higher highs in crypto prices in the near and distant future,” the top member Judgemind detailed this April. “This switch in the market is great for domain investors, more new startups will emerge in the crypto space and blockchain technology will continue to evolve.

According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin started the month of August trading below $10,000; hitting $9,983.08 per coin at 05:44 UTC on August 1.

It then recovered, surpassing the $10,000 mark, reaching $10,036.70 later that day.

Bitcoin’s monthly performance via CoinMarketCap

The cryptocurrency reached its highest value so far this month on August 6 at 10:44 UTC, when it climbed to $12,222.69.

Bitcoin dropped to its lowest point of the month so far on August 15 at 07:44 UTC, hovering at $9,685.83

At the time of writing, the world’s most famous cryptocurrency was trading at around $10,230.29 a coin.

Bitcoin is often dubbed “digital gold,” and pitched as an alternative to the real thing. Earlier this year, a Hard Fork report showed that the two assets performed almost identically for about a month.

Gold’s relatively poor performance is potentially linked to a lack of clarity on the US Federal Reserves’ outlook for interest rate cuts. This, some commentators say, may have triggered investors to cash in some gains ahead of chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming speech. Powell is expected to deliver much-needed clarity on monetary policy, Reuters says.

Spot gold – the price at which gold may be purchased and sold right now, as opposed to a date in the future – was down 0.3 percent to $1,494.60 per ounce as of 04:00 GMT.

Overall, gold declined in value by almost 1.3 percent so far this week, seemingly on track for its biggest weekly percentage decline since March 29.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at over $6,000 more than it was on March 29, when the cryptocurrency’s price hovered just above the $4,000 mark.

Both Bitcoin and gold have proved helpful to investors. They have both, at some points in their lives, been leveraged as speculative investments or safe-haven assets.

One clear difference between the two is that gold is tangible, while Bitcoin isn’t. Similarly, Bitcoin roams wild and free, but gold trading is widely regulated.

They say comparisons are odious and while that’s largely true, I think it’s fair to say that Bitcoin is winning, at least for now.

Cryptocurrencies have remained somewhat elusive to the average internet user – a party that only those “in the know” attend. Since the advent of these digital assets 10 years ago, the blockchain-powered currency market has taken a leisurely amble to where it is now. It still has yet to go mainstream and fully infiltrate day-to-day life.

Yet, ironically, computer screens are continuously bombarded with adverts encouraging investing in cryptocurrencies and promising the opportunity for big returns, with some being fraudulent or not clear about the risks. In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has found over £27m was lost in the 2018-19 financial year to crypto and forex investment scams, prompting it to release Final Guidance on what cryptocurrency activities it regulates.

But cryptocurrencies continue to thrive and with the likes of Facebook already working on making its own digital money – Libra – digital payments and currencies are likely to soon make the widespread impact they failed to in the past decade.

Otherwise known as tokens, cryptocurrencies are alluring because they are independent of Central Banks. Where the Bank of England is responsible for controlling sterling, cryptocurrencies’ value and ownership is monitored by computer systems, blockchain technology and cryptography. These systems are run entirely by computers and keep users of the currencies anonymous. It’s a quicker and cheaper way of carrying out banking transactions, but lacks any regulatory oversight. The relative newness of these tokens – the first, Bitcoin, was launched 10 years ago – and the continual introduction of new cryptocurrencies also means there’s always opportunity to find ones that could soar in popularity and in value.

A changing world

Gavin Brown, senior lecturer at the Future Economies Research Centre at Manchester Metropolitan University, views them as a powerful product.

“If you went to someone 50 years ago and said I’ve invented a product that allows people to be their own bank – that’s the kind of thing that changes the world,” he says.

“If we look at the valuation of Bitcoin now for instance, it’s at $10,000 per coin. All crypto currencies are at about a quarter of a trillion dollars. They’re about a thousand times smaller than all global existing money but if we find that one of them is able to be adopted in a significant sense, then the valuations would be much, much higher in the future. The potential for gains is still very much there.”

There is also opportunity to diversify and invest in a number of cryptoassets, such as casinos, e-commerce stores and social networks.

Iqbal Gandham, UK Managing Director of eToro, a social trading network says: “About 20 years ago people were building businesses on the internet, now we’re building them on the blockchain. Ask yourself: ‘is this a business idea worth investing in?’”

Risky business

There’s no getting away from the fact that what makes cryptocurrencies appealing to many is what also makes them a liability. The decentralisation of tokens means they do not have an arbiter, such as the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).

According to the FCA, investment cryptoasset scams are on the rise. The number of incidents reported to the watchdog more than tripled last year to reach 1,800, with victims losing an average of £14,600 to each scam.

Fraudsters target consumers through adverts on social media that link to professional-looking websites, which then encourage them to invest using cryptocurrencies or traditional money, but never transfer expected funds, or they ask the victim for more money to do so.

However, some cryptocurrency derivatives fall under the regulation of the FCA, in certain areas such as Specified Investment. Here, the FCA applies the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, the EU legislation that regulates firms who provide services to clients linked to “financial instruments”.

“When you’re thinking about whether to invest in a currency or not, you need to look at how well developed that community of interested parties, users and what are called miners,” warns Gavin.

“Because if it’s quite broad such as Bitcoin, which is obviously the lead currency, then that can give you some surety around its validity and use as a money, and hopefully it’s going to more stable moving forward.”

The FCA warns to look out for scam adverts promising high returns from cryptoassets and to always check their list of firms authorised to sell cryptoasset investment derivatives and those that are on their warning list. Even investing with real cryptocurrencies is not for the risk-averse. The market is volatile and cryptocurrencies can quickly vanish from existence. “I would only be getting into investment in crypto if you can cope with potentially losing that money, in the same way you would do with stocks and shares,” says David Thomas, a director at GlobalBlock, a digital asset broker.

‘It’s a really dangerous world in cryptocurrency’ Jay Smith, 31 Crypto trader Basingstoke, Hampshire “I first invested in Bitcoin back in January 2013. I read through the whitepaper a few times, watched a few YouTube videos, trying to figure out how it works and if it had any value. At the time it was worth about $20. “After about three or four weeks of researching, I was pretty confident – to the point where three or four months after that, I withdrew most of my money from the exchange. I was previously trading stocks on the market but I withdrew it and put it into cryptocurrency instead. “It would have been £8,000-£9,000. That was my savings for a house, and I put almost all of it into Bitcoin. Effectively, those Bitcoins made me a millionaire by the end of 2018. I knew it was very inflated at that moment in time, to the point where I did consider selling a bunch, but I haven’t sold any of my original coins at the moment. The more money you have, the more you want to be diversified in safe assets as well. “I have a three-bedroom house now. I still have a mortgage but it’s better than a lot of 31-year-olds. “The industry I was working in at the time was gaming. In that industry you learnt to understand not only the idea of the technology behind it, but also the idea of digital money. It’s massive validation for cryptocurrency, the fact that the bigger companies in the world are investing so much money, but I think on the flipside that it’s a little bit scary and dystopian, the idea of companies running the monetary system. “I’m very much in favour of the FCA regulating exchanges. It’s a really dangerous world in cryptocurrency. But I think if you over-regulate, there’s a risk of losing that industry from the UK or whichever country it is that’s regulating it.”

Regulation vs Institutionalisation

Cryptocurrencies are certainly with us to stay. Currently, the cryptocurrency market cap lists 2,400 in existence, compared to 180 national currencies. While formal regulation may still be some way off, institutionalisation may be a more likely prospect, which would see them available to everyday consumers in a more controlled fashion.

Central banks are already looking to introduce their own types of cryptocurrencies, the bank of England currently researching how it could work in the UK economy.

“Most central banks are thinking ‘here is a disruptive technology which is a bank killer and also threatens the power of central banks, we need to think about how we’re going to respond to it’,” says Gavin.

In February this year, JP Morgan declared the first US bank-backed cryptocurrency which will help in financial transactions between institutional clients.

If successful, Facebook will introduce Libra next year, making it easily accessible to its users. As a big player in the digital world this will undoubtedly make a cryptocurrency mainstream and usable in a way one has never been before.

Here to stay

“It’s a technology that’s not going to go away,” says Gavin. “We’re starting to see a trend where multinationals – particularly if they’ve got a strong brand – are thinking ‘I can also sell [consumers] the monetary system that they’re going to use to purchase these goods or services.’

“All of these other cryptocurrencies, by their very nature, they aren’t a true cryptocurrency because they are centralised, but what you are seeing with the advent of the JP Morgan coin and Libra is that it’s driving the adoption. People can then start understanding and finding out more, which then in itself will attract people to invest within it.”",2019-08-23 16:02:34+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/23/bitcoin-seized-hacker-grant-west-uk-compensate-victims,"A judge has ordered the confiscation of bitcoin worth more than £900,000 from a jailed hacker in the first case of its kind for the Metropolitan police.

Grant West, 27 – previously described as a “one-man cybercrime wave” – had about £1m-worth of the cryptocurrency seized from a number of accounts after his arrest in September 2017, but the value of bitcoin has since fluctuated radically, complicating attempts to compensate victims.

Proceedings in Southwark crown court on Friday morning were temporarily stalled as the order signed by West agreeing to the confiscation of the cryptocurrency related to a higher amount than that which was confiscated.

Eventually announcing the order under the Proceeds of Crime Act, the judge, Joanna Korner QC, said: “I therefore order a confiscation of that amount, £915,305.77, to be paid as a way of compensation to the losers.”

She said West would spend an additional four years in jail if he refused. He has agreed to comply with the order.

UK authorities have been in possession of 82 bitcoin previously obtained by West through criminal activity since before his sentencing. Unlike fiat currencies, there is no centralised exchange rate for the currency, which rose in value to almost £18,000 a bitcoin in December 2017 before falling below £7,000 in May 2018.

The value of the seized assets was calculated by authorities on Friday at a rate of about £8,500 a bitcoin.

Q&A What is bitcoin? Show Bitcoin is the first, and the biggest, 'cryptocurrency' – a decentralised tradeable digital asset. The lack of any central authority oversight is one of the attractions. Cryptocurrencies can be used to send transactions between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing cost, allowing users to avoid the fees charged by traditional financial institutions - as well as the oversight and regulation that entails. This means it has attracted a range of backers, from libertarian monetarists who enjoy the idea of a currency with no inflation and no central bank, to drug dealers who like the fact that it is hard (but not impossible) to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a physical person. The exchange rate has been volatile, making it a risky investment. In practice it has been far more important for the dark economy than it has for most legitimate uses, but in recent years mainstream interest in bitcoin has surged, and towards the end of 2020 it jumped above $17,000 to a three-year high, as a growing number of investors backed it as an alternative to other assets during the Covid crisis.



“Inevitably in any case like this there will have to be a further hearing after this,” the prosecuting counsel, Kevin Barry, told the court. “As the court recognises today, as do the parties, there is likely to be fluctuation which will require in due course for the order to be amended upwards or downwards.”

The Metropolitan police had also seized a much smaller amount in other cryptocurrencies, including ethereum and bitcoin cash, after a lengthy investigation, codenamed Operation Draba.

About £200,000 in bitcoin was being held by the FBI under its own investigation, and had been frozen on the request of the Crown Prosecution Service, Barry told reporters.

Though police were already in control of the assets, the defendant must legally agree to the default sentence because he may have refused to sell the assets. The cryptocurrency was seized by the Met after West was caught on a train from Rhyl to London with his “fingers on the keyboard”.

It was being held by authorities in secure accounts and would be sold on the open market in due course by an agent of the crown, Barry said.

The head of the Met’s cybercrime unit, DCI Kirsty Goldsmith, said: “The MPS is committed to ensuring that individuals who are committing criminality on the dark web are identified, prosecuted and their criminal assets are seized … I am very proud of my team for bringing this offender to justice and ensuring we have secured this order.”

In May 2018, West, of Sheerness, Kent, was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison for a number of offences including unauthorised modification of computer material, conspiracy to defraud and possession of criminal property.

Using the online identity “Courvoisier”, he carried out cyber-attacks over two and a half years on more than 100 companies and organisations worldwide including Sainsbury’s, Asda, Uber, the British Cardiovascular Society and the bookmakers Ladbrokes and Coral.

He sold the information on the dark web and collected his profits in online caches. Officers discovered about 78m individual usernames and passwords along with 63,000 credit and debit card details stored on an SD card recovered from his address.

Masquerading as the food delivery service Just Eat between July and December 2015, he also attempted to obtain the email addresses of more than 160,000 people through an unsuccessful phishing scam, which cost the company about £200,000.

West started trading on the dark web in March 2015 and completed more than 47,000 sales from an online “store”, the Met said. Along with financial data, he also sold cannabis, which he shipped to customers, as well as how to guides instructing others how to carry out cyber-attacks.

The confiscation follows the sentencing in Norwich last week of Elliott Gunton, 19, who hacked the telecom company TalkTalk and sold personal data in exchange for hundreds of thousands of pounds in cryptocurrency.",2019-08-23,https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-employee-explains-why-he-chose-a-100-bitcoin-salary,"""People always ask how I am coping with living on Bitcoin,” a British software developer told The Mirror in an interview this week, “but the truth is that my lifestyle hasn’t really changed.”

The Mirror — a British daily tabloid founded over a century ago — ran its interview with 24-year old Zakk Lakin on Aug. 22.

An employee at crypto exchange CoinCorner, Lakin was given the option to receive part — or all — of his salary paid in cryptocurrency, and he went the full monty.

100% Bitcoin

Lakin noted “buying things with crypto is easier than people think,” given that there are multiple online retailers that accept cryptocurrency and even third-party tools that allow you to settle invoices on platforms such as Amazon.

In the future, he predicts, more and more retailers — from gas stations to eateries — will open up to cryptocurrency, enabling him to spend less in fiat and more in Bitcoin (BTC).

When it comes to his paycheck, he added, under the current crypto market conditions:

“I convert all of my permanent outgoings (such as rent, direct debits etc) to British pounds on payday to avoid any issues around the Bitcoin price movements and then the rest is left for disposable income/savings.""

As The Mirror notes, as an exchange employee, Lakin is spared the platform fees when he sells and trades his holdings for fiat currency.

Aside from running his own Bitcoin node, Lakin said his choice to be paid in Bitcoin was shaped by a sense of the importance of using the cryptocurrency as it was originally intended — as electronic cash. He added:

""On top of it all, the conversations it creates are always worth it for spreading awareness and educating others about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.""

Bitcoin in Albion

As reported, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, memorably claimed in 2018 that Bitcoin had failed as a currency by traditional measures. Volatility loomed large in his criticism, with Carney saying at the time:

“If you had taken out a £1,000 student loan in Bitcoin in last December to pay your sterling living costs for next year, you’d be short about £500 right now. If you’d done the same last September, you’d be ahead by £2,000. That’s quite a lottery.”

This July, Carney argued that people need to acknowledge the issues Facebook is attempting to solve with Libra, regardless of the project’s potential pitfalls. If Libra can conform to regulatory demands, he stated a week later, the stablecoin could have genuine use cases.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-facebooks-libra-has-been-influencing-crypto-politics-and-finance,"Over the past few days, a number of Libra-related announcements have been made — only, they weren’t from Facebook, the Libra Association, Calibra wallet or any other party involved in its development.

First, top crypto exchange Binance announced a project called “Venus” — coincidentally, another astrology-themed name — which will focus on developing “localized stablecoins” worldwide; the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) said it is almost ready to launch its government-backed digital currency, reportedly admitting that Libra prompted it to speed up; and Erik Finman, ostensibly the youngest Bitcoin (BTC) millionaire, launched a crypto peer-to-peer (P2P) payment app, called “Metal” — daringly marketing it as ""the Libra killer.""

Related: What Is Libra? Breaking Down Facebook’s New Digital Currency

Libra has been making waves since its white paper was released in mid-June, prompting regulators across the world to form global task forces, United States legislators to hold multiple hearings in the Senate and crypto firms to roll out competing projects.

However, Libra itself is still far from seeing the light of day: Its initial release is scheduled for 2020, but given the scale of regulatory backlash it has been facing, the future of Facebook’s crypto venture is hardly set in stone. Nevertheless, just two months in, its influence on the space is already palpable.

Libra and the regulatory splash

Libra, a stablecoin-like digital asset and a blockchain-based financial infrastructure project, was officially announced on June 18, when Facebook published its white paper. The release followed several media reports suggesting that the social media titan was developing a cryptocurrency that will facilitate payments across its platforms — WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram — which boast a combined 2.7 billion monthly users.

The project seeks to target the unbanked population, which accounts for around 1.7 billion adults across the globe, with a focus on cross-border remittance. The latter aspect puts Libra alongside the likes of Visa and Mastercard — both of which have invested in the project — as well as some fellow cryptocurrency firms like Ripple and the XRP token.

The project will be governed by the Libra Association, a not-for-profit consortium headquartered in Switzerland, which includes Mastercard, PayPal, Visa, eBay, Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, Lyft and Uber among a total of 28 founding members.

There is also Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary, which is developing an eponymous digital wallet to facilitate Libra transactions, while the currency will be supported by third-party wallets — as the software powering the Libra blockchain is open source, as its developers have said. Once ready, the wallet will be available to all of the social media’s users.

The looming release of Facebook’s new project caused immediate regulatory resentment, triggering a new wave of national-level discussions on the legal status of cryptocurrencies. The company’s infamous reputation for being involved in privacy-related scandals — the most recent being Cambridge Analytica, which resulted in a record-breaking $5 billion fine — its all-encompassing scale and its barefaced interest in cryptocurrencies made it an unmissable target for regulators across the world.

Related: US Congress on Libra Overview: Trust, Privacy and Genocide Accusations

In July, U.S. congressional hearings on the matter began, and Calibra CEO David Marcus was interviewed twice before Congress. The key take-away from those meetings was that Facebook won’t launch Libra until regulators’ concerns are fully addressed, as Marcus explicitly reassured both lawmakers and investors. That has not entirely mitigated the pushback, however, as the European Union antitrust regulators have launched a probe into Libra.

Meanwhile, U.S. legislators — including vocal Libra skeptic Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) — are travelling to Switzerland, the home of the Libra Association, to meet with Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner Adrian Lobsiger to exchange views about digital currencies.

John Todaro, director of research and provider of institutional trading tools for digital currencies at TradeBlock, summarized the main reasons behind the intensified scrutiny in a comment for Cointelegraph:

“The primary attention Libra is getting is because of the size of Facebook, its resources, and its ability to integrate a low cost, efficient digital currency payment channel across a number of its own platforms which could bring significant adoption to the space. Other projects have not seen the same level of interest, mainly because they do not have an ability to accelerate adoption of a stablecoin so quickly, which Facebook could accomplish.”

The scale of the regulatory backlash is not surprising, despite the rawness of Facebook’s project, experts say. Konstantinos Stylianou, assistant professor of competition law and regulation at the University of Leeds, told Cointelegraph that for regulators, it is never too early to start worrying about potential problems. He elaborated:

“Financial regulators are right to go in first, because financial regulation aims to ensure that Libra and its clones comply with set standards before they launch. Other regulators, like the European Commission's antitrust arm, which recently started an investigation into Libra, have a long way to go, because they need to prove actual harm. But even so, their early activity sends a message to the industry that the regulator's watchful eye is there to stop illegal activity at its inception.”

Other experts, like Lars Seier Christensen, chairman of Swiss blockchain identity network Concordium and former CEO at Saxo Bank, are even surprised that Facebook has not foreseen some of the regulators’ worries. Christensen explained to Cointelegraph:

“I actually fully understand the concerns of regulators as Libra raises a host of major issues because of the potential scale of the project. I think Facebook may have been a little too quick off the block here, because many of the concerns about systemic risk, disruption of money markets, and moral hazard were easily predictable and could have been addressed from the beginning.”

Libra and its killers: Chinese government, Binance and Walmart

While many of the aforementioned jurisdictions were busy discussing the potential ways to regulate Libra, China took a somewhat different approach. For the East Asian powerhouse, where the sale of cryptocurrencies is explicitly banned, Facebook's project turned out to be the prime motivator in hastening the development of its own state-controlled digital currency.

Notably, during one of the congressional hearings, Marcus warned lawmakers that vetoing Libra could result in the U.S. being left behind:

""I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will. If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.”

China steps in

Thus, after five years of research and system development work since 2018, the PBoC is almost ready to launch its central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a recent report from the state-owned news portal China Daily. As Yang Dong — director of the Research Center of Finance Technology and Cyber Security at Renmin University of China — told the publication that the announcement of Libra has motivated the project’s designers to involve more private institutions in development and issuance process of a CBDC, which seems to follow the concept of the Libra Association.

Related: Chinese National Cryptocurrency Turns Out Not Being an Actual Crypto

Co-founder of a decentralized cloud computing network Aelf, Chen Zhuling, whose associate Ma Haobo is a committee member of the government-affiliated Chinese Institute of Electronics Blockchain Branch, told Cointelegraph in an email conversation that:

“Considering how mobile payment and e-money has been fully adopted in the Chinese society, it is inevitable that the government is also looking at digital currency initiative. More than half of global Bitcoin hash rate is under mining pools in China, the government is no strange to cryptocurrency.”

Patrick Dai, co-founder of Qtum, a blockchain platform that has a presence in China, is largely optimistic about the project, as he told Cointelegraph that the PBoC’s currency is likely to beat Facebook in terms of public resonance and will challenge “the monopoly” of local giants WeChat and Alipay:

“People’s Bank of China’s digital currency will escalate and affect crypto adoption at a much greater magnitude than Facebook’s Libra announcement. There is already overwhelming distrust of Facebook. Introducing a new asset class also brings healthy competition to the Chinese FinTech ecosystem, which is currently dominated by a few major players. A complimentary payment solution helps break up the monopoly of power from payment giants like WeChatPay and Alipay.”

However, CBDCs and privately issued cryptocurrencies can co-exist, which is relevant for capitalist economic systems exclusively, professor Stylianou said:

“Central bank cryptocurrencies and private cryptocurrencies are not in a zero-sum game. The adoption of one does not detract from the adoption of the other. They can and will most likely co-exist, much like state-provisioned goods co-exist with privately-provisioned goods in every other industry. This, of course, only applies to free capitalistic economies.”

Binance launches a race to the stars

Other Libra competitors come from the private sector. Arguably, the strongest attempt to topple Facebook’s crypto project is being performed by Binance, one of the world’s largest crypto exchange, although, as its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, diplomatically noted, it is “always happy to co-exist.”

Thus, following the astrological theme, Binance’s open blockchain project is dubbed “Venus” and focuses on developing localized stablecoins around the world based on Binance Chain, which reportedly has a wide user base and has already established global compliance measures.

Related: Binance Venus Aims to Outshine Libra and Chinese National Crypto?

However, it is still unclear whether Venus actually could rival Libra for the global crown. Judging by the announcements made in English and Chinese, the tones used are drastically different, with the latter mentioning challenging “financial hegemony” and creating “independent ‘regional version of Libra.’” Binance has not yet responded to Cointelegraph’s request for clarification regarding the relationship with Libra.

There is also a global retail giant, Walmart, that has already filed a patent for a U.S. dollar-backed digital currency similar to Libra. According to the retail giant, it could provide low-income households — for whom banking is costly — with “an alternative way to handle wealth at an institution that can supply the majority of their day-to-day financial and product needs.” Additionally, it could further challenge incumbent banks by removing the need for credit and debit cards, Walmart suggested in the filing.

Libra has also provoked a response from smaller, crypto-oriented startups, which are brazingly calling themselves “Libra killers.” For instance, Erik Finmann, known as the youngest Bitcoin millionaire, has recently announced a crypto P2P payment app called “Metal” that reportedly supports Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), among other cryptocurrencies.

It seems to be working in select U.S. states at the moment, which makes it unclear how it could “finally bring crypto to the people — in ways that Facebook Libra only wishes they could,” as Finmann put it on Twitter, given the scale of the social media giant’s operation. Metal has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request to clarify the scale of its operation.

Libra’s influence has accelerated, despite all the difficulties

While it is not certain if Libra will ever manage to get through the regulatory hurdles it is facing, its impact on the crypto industry — and even the larger financial world — is evident. TradeBlock’s Todaro told Cointelegraph, “Libra has influenced the industry insofar that other large corporate entities and governments have sped up their projects on stablecoins, such as Wal-mart, PBoC, Binance and others.”

Notably, while the overall scope of Facebook’s crypto project could have been predicted, experts are perplexed by the breakneck speed at which everything around it is unfolding. “It was only a matter of time until Libra contenders emerged,” Stylianou told Cointelegraph. “What's surprising is how quickly it's all happening.” He went on to say:

“The majority of Libra killers will be extinct within a few years (including, possibly, Libra itself), as it always happens with prototypes, but that at the same time means that some others will survive.”

Thus, Libra seems to be actively unsettling the crypto space even at its most infant stage, urging other actors to launch similar stablecoin-based projects or join it by investing as much as $10 million. Among the interested parties are online brokerage Monex Group Inc., the owner of the hacked Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck and even the Winklevoss twins, who have famously had a falling out with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook in the past.

On the other hand, some of the earlier investors are reportedly asking to get off the train because they’re frustrated with Libra’s half-baked strategy — as well as the intense regulatory pushback it has been getting.

Cointelegraph has reached out to the Libra Association for further comment, but has not received a reply as of press time.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-taxation-around-the-globe-what-do-regulations-look-like,"Upon its inception, Bitcoin was envisioned as a borderless currency that could be used by its owners without being affected by the regulatory impositions of any centralized agency or government body. And while this idea in itself is quite grand, the fact of the matter is that today's crypto owners (across the globe) are subject to varying tax restrictions on their digital holdings by local regulatory bodies.

Also, over the course of the past few months, a number of tax agencies around the globe, (such as the United States Internal Revenue Service) have been in the process of creating new guidance frameworks for overseeing their respective crypto industries. For example, Japanese tax authorities have been sifting through data obtained from various local exchanges so as to nab evaders and cheats, while the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is currently operating a number of investigations regarding tax-avoidance ploys that involve large volumes of digital currencies.

These developments clearly point to the fact that crypto is a matter of concern for a number of tax departments around the world — primarily because they provide people with an avenue for commerce that expands beyond today's existing financial systems. So, here are some crypto-centric economic frameworks that are being used by countries across the globe.

United States

Per the IRS, digital currencies are classified as property that is liable to taxation according to its annual value appreciation or depreciation. Additionally, the U.S. government does not currently recognize crypto assets as being legitimate forms of money — thereby eliminating any provisions for currency conversion-based tax incentives.

Crypto holders within the U.S. are liable to be taxed on their digital assets that have appreciated in value over the span of a single financial year. Not only that, even cryptocurrencies acquired via mining or other trade activities are subject to tax. In regard to the matter, owners are required to declare the fair market worth of their coins (at the time of their purchase) using published exchange rates to determine their taxable value.

This taxation process is quite cumbersome and has resulted in many people making use of cryptocurrency accounting programs that are designed to automatically generate the required records with price conversions in the form of an auditable, tax-friendly report.

Most members of the European Union make use of radically different financial policies and tax codes to govern their respective crypto sectors. They can be either beneficial or harmful for local investors. For example, in Germany, Bitcoin (BTC) is not subject to any capital gains tax — thereby allowing investors to avoid paying significant levies on their holdings if the value of their BTC appreciates.

However, the kicker here is that the crypto needs to be held by the owner for a period of at least 12 months. Also, crypto business owners are required to pay a levy on any gains that are derived from their personal Bitcoin-related possessions (i.e., via corporate income taxes).

In addition, it must be acknowledged that EU citizens currently have the right to move around the region and take up residence anywhere across Germany to favor their commercial pursuits. However, tax residency in Germany is subject to a number of factors including:

Whether the applicant has a private residence in Germany or not.

Whether that person has physically stayed in Germany for more than 6 months at a stretch.

Whether, in matters related to dual citizenships, the individuals tax status in Germany is determined by ""the contracting state in which the employee has a centre of vital (personal and economic) interests.""

Last but not least, per rule 23 EStG, German crypto enthusiasts can trade their tokens in a completely tax-free manner — provided that their capital gains do not exceed a total of 600 euros per year.

Switzerland

One of the world’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions in the world, Switzerland currently houses the headquarters for the Ethereum Foundation as well as the Libra Association. When studied closely, the country’s tax treatment of cryptocurrencies is quite interesting. For starters, any income acquired through mining has to be declared as self-employment income, while income gained through professional trading is subject to business tax.

Individuals receiving their wages in crypto need to declare their assets for income tax purposes.

If an investor qualifies as somebody who trades solely from his/her personal account, their cryptocurrency gains are treated as tax-exempt capital gains.

Switzerland makes use of a canton tax structure, wherein different regions levy different taxes on a person’s cryptocurrency holdings.

Australia

The Australian Taxation Office recently released a guidance framework that clearly expounds its stance toward the digital asset industry — especially Bitcoin and certain other premier cryptocurrencies. The ATO classifies BTC, Ether (ETH), etc. as being “forms of property” that are taxable.

On this very subject, a spokesperson for the regulatory body was quoted as saying: ""Any financial gains made from the selling of bitcoin will generally be subject to capital gains tax (CGT) and must be reported to the ATO.""

Additionally, the ATO views BTC-based transactions as being “barter arrangements” that are not subject to goods and services tax. However, deals involving the the flagship crypto asset are still subject to capital gains tax. The spokesperson mentioned this matter, saying:

“Our view is that bitcoin is neither money nor a foreign currency, and the supply of bitcoin is not a financial supply for goods and services tax (GST) purposes. Bitcoin is, however, an asset for capital gains tax (CGT) purposes.”

Japan

There are a number of Asian countries that have taken crypto adoption quite seriously. For example, Japan — a nation where it is legal for people to facilitate their everyday payments using crypto — digital currencies are treated as commodities that are subject to income tax, capital gains tax and corporate tax.

While the filing process is slowly becoming streamlined — with taxes ranging between 15% and 55% — many people still find the process quite cumbersome because they are required to pay levy’s on their asset/conversion gains. Also, owing to the fact that BTC/yen is one of the most popular trading pairs in the world, it seems as though Japan’s existing tax framework will allow the Asian powerhouse to draw in large streams of revenue from its crypto industry.

Lastly, the Japanese government recently announced its decision to create a new tracking system that will allow the National Tax Agency to obtain data from transaction intermediaries, such as digital currency exchanges, altcoin trading portals, etc. Not only that, new regulations will be enforced by the end of the year, making the crypto owners — who earn over 10 million yen (about $88,700) in profits — subject to certain niche taxes.

South Korea

As things stand, the South Korean government is seeking to derive financial benefit by taxing both its digital currency market as well as its Initial Coin Offering industry. In this regard, Han Seung-hee — commissioner of Korea’s National Tax Service — recently told media that he was planning to tax the use of Bitcoin after the digital asset’s local trading volume skyrocketed not long ago. He also said that he is looking at a number of different ways in which to foster BTC’s relationship with the nation’s existing capital gains tax, value-added tax and gift tax structures. Han said:

“Gains and losses (gains or losses recognized on the basis of relative relationships with foreign currencies or foreign currency) arising from the use of bitcoin, as a general rule, except for cases arising in association with acts that cause various incomes such as business income, are classified as miscellaneous income.”

Malta

One of the most popular crypto havens in the world, Malta’s existing economic setup is designed in such a way that it does not tax digital assets. However, any money made through activities related to day trading is considered to be business income and is thus subject to regular taxation.

In terms of setting up one’s business, citizens of the EU, the European Economic Area or Switzerland are allowed to freely move and facilitate their commercial activities across the country. However, in order for other interested individuals to take advantage of Malta’s lax crypto regulations, they will have to either buy property worth (at least) 275,000 euros (roughly $300,000) or pay rent of up to 9,600 euros (about $10,600) per year to the local government.

Singapore

Singapore has been a trailblazer when it comes to crypto taxation — with the government only taxing profits that are acquired via trading activities associated with one’s digital currency holdings. Businesses or even individuals who have been in possession of their cryptos for extended periods of time (including long-term investment) are not taxed by the local regulator.

Additionally, corporate tax residency (in Singapore) only comes into the picture if a business is actually running from within the nation’s borders. Similarly, individuals are considered tax residents, if and only if, they have spent a total of 183 days or more within the country.

Belarus

During Q1 2018, the Belarusian government passed a law that was designed to legalize crypto activities across the nation as well as make digital currencies exempt from a host of existing tax schemes. Similarly, under the aforementioned law, even cryptocurrency mining and investment-related activities are exempt from taxes until the end of 2023.

Canada

Canadian laws tax cryptocurrencies in pretty much the same way as they treat any other investment commodity — i.e., 50% of all acquired gains are tax deductible and are automatically added to an individual’s annual income (for that financial year).

Also, day traders who indulge in high transaction volume activities may be considered to be business entities by the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA), as a result of which they might have to file their taxes using different forms. Lastly, the law requires investors to keep an accurate tab of their crypto-trading activities for purposes related to capital gains tax — and failing to do so might make them liable to certain penalties and financial impositions by the CRA.",,https://www.coindesk.com/amazon-cloud-outage-causing-major-issues-at-some-crypto-exchanges,"Problems with Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, are disrupting services at some cryptocurrency exchanges on Friday.

The Binance exchange is seeing problems internationally, according to its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who tweeted:

It’s causing some 500 error messages on APIs and affecting some withdrawal processing — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) August 23, 2019

The KuCoin cypto exchange is also saying there are problems with its AWS Tokyo-hosted services.

The firm states on its website:

“Due to the overheating of part of our chassis in the machine room we deployed in AWS, Tokyo, part of our services might become unavailable. The engineering operation team is currently deploying relevant resources of high availability across regions to deal with any possible emergencies that might happen. Some services might be effected during the deployment.”

Founding partner at Primitive Ventures Dovey Wan has tweeted that a number of Asian exchanges are affected and the AWS issues are producing erratic market data.

“Many Asian exchanges see price instability (and trades were able to execute, yes you can buy extremely cheap Bitcoin if you had limit orders there),” she wrote.

She also tweeted a screen grab, apparently of order book data from an unnamed exchange that suggests traders have been able to buy 45 bitcoin for less than $1 (in the tether stablecoin, USDT). The price of bitcoin at time of writing should be around $10,190, according to CoinDesk’s global average price index.



In a similar instance, some users were able to execute trades on bitcoin for as low as $0.32, based on CITEX exchange’s order book (see long green candle on image below). The candle appears backed by high volumes as orders were presumably triggered by the super-low price.

AWS’ status page indeed indicates that there are problems at its Tokyo facility. The firm says it has found the root cause and the situation is starting to return to normal.

CoinDesk has reached out to confirm the reports of bitcoin purchases at sub-$1 levels and will update this article if more information is received.

What no one saw coming was a Donald Trump-shaped bump in the road. So when the US president waded in with his two penneth – branding bitcoin as being based on “nothing but thin air” – it stopped the advance in its tracks. There then followed a series of outbursts from senior financial figures in the US, coupled with a string of scandals that did little to curb the unease of anyone with trust issues over cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin – still the most dominant crypto by some considerable margin – slipped from its lofty perch and began to fall down the branches of $12,000 and $11,000 before crumpling in a heap at $10,000 where it currently crouches in what many see as a safe place. Don’t hold your breath, though. Donald Trump has the bit between his teeth now and is sending in some more heavies to kick BTC while it’s down. Seizing on the current momentum behind fixing America’s crippling opioid epidemic, the White House this week sent an advisory to all its financial institutions urging them to help tackle synthetic drugs – namely fentanyl.

Donald Trump is not a fan of bitcoin

That advisory note detailed how the White House believed drug smugglers were financing their opioid rackets across the Mexican border, and the finger of blame is being pointed directly at cryptocurrencies. In fact, it specifically singles out Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Monero as having a direct bearing on an opioid epidemic that has gripped the US for years. Almost a thousand people a week die across the states from opioid-related overdoses. ""Drug traffickers and consumers increasingly use clearnet and darknet e-commerce markets, paired with online payment systems and virtual currencies, to further anonymise fentanyl purchase and distribution,"" says the White House advisory.",2019-08-23 10:33:00+01:00

The move projects Coinbase Custody to the status of the world’s largest institutional digital asset custodian, securing more than $7 billion on behalf of over 120 clients globally. According to some estimates, Coinbase could now be holding over 5% of all Bitcoin in circulation.

Xapo, founded by early crypto evangelist Wences Casares and reported to be stashing cryptocurrency in secure vaults hidden in the Swiss Alps, has stated that the decision was prompted by the need to focus on the firm’s core retail exchange business.

The community response in the wake of the news revealed a complex amalgam of sentiments and considerations with regard to the emerging custody concentration dynamics — ranging from excitement for the upcoming onslaught of institutional investors to concern over monopolistic tendencies to excavation of prophecies from Bitcoin’s early days.

The role of custody

Put simply, custody is a service of securely storing somebody else’s assets in a way that ensures regulatory compliance and allows users to perform operations — such as on-demand retrieval, collection of dividends or collateralizing derivative instruments, to name a few. While keeping track of where and how their money and stocks reside is easy for most individuals, it is a task traditionally outsourced on an institutional scale.

As crypto assets become a prominent part of the financial ecosystem, with institutional actors leveraging immense volumes of cryptocurrency, the question of how to go about storing and handling digital wealth at scale comes to the fore. However different from traditional financial instruments, blockchain-based assets still need to be secured in an organized manner to ensure a comparable level of compliance and protection.

Alex Lam, co-founder and CEO of digital asset services platform RockX, observed to Cointelegraph that custodians in the crypto space do for institutional actors what hot and cold wallets do for retail investors:

“For large financial institutions and corporations who trade on a much larger scale than regular market participants, the security provided by trusted third parties bearing the burden of custodianship will give these legacy organizations the confidence and certainty they have come to expect in more traditional markets.”

Legitimizing the asset class

In traditional finance, custody is seen as the layer responsible for security and stability of the system, as it ensures that the assets held are both safe and compliant with the existing regulatory frameworks. Many stakeholders of the digital asset domain expect institutional custody to do the same job in the still-volatile cryptocurrency markets, serving as a legitimizing force for the industry in the eyes of both regulators as well as capital-rich financial firms wary to invest in the space.

Charles Lu, CEO of Findora, a blockchain service for building decentralized financial applications, said in a statement to Cointelegraph that he sees maturing custodial services in the blockchain sector as lowering the barriers for institutional investors to enter the market, which is a welcome development:

“Institutional investors require built-in support for automated compliance, as well as security, privacy and transparency. To succeed, the crypto finance ecosystem needs to listen to the needs of the market. Until more regulated, secure, reputable custodians enter the market, widespread institutional investment in digital assets will remain low.”

Tom Maxon, head of CoolBitX’s operations in the United States, emphasized the role that financial regulators play in shaping the custodians’ business, telling Cointelegraph that:

“Custodians tend to be large and reputable firms that are responsible for holding customers’ assets or securities for safekeeping in order to minimize the risk of their theft or loss. As this role is mandated by regulators overseeing the operations of financial institutions, they are unlikely to abandon the use of a custodian to enter into the cryptocurrency realm.”

Maxon added that the role that centralized exchanges currently perform in the crypto space is similar to that of institutional custodians, although such platforms are not particularly well-equipped for this position, saying, “It is widely-known that centralized exchanges are often hacked, making them unreliable and too risky for centralized crypto exchanges to be considered custodians by regulators.”

Interestingly, while many commentators associate the emerging centralized crypto custody trend with the prospect of a more efficient and straightforward regulatory framework for the industry over time, some are worried about the current lack of oversight.

For one, entrepreneur and investor Roy Sebag pointed out in a tweet how Coinbase has amassed an enormous pool of value without having to go through standard auditing and financial reporting procedures, which would be unimaginable in the traditional finance.

Kevin Sekniqi, co-founder and chief protocol architect at AVA Labs, and Amani Moin, the company’s chief protocol architect for cryptoeconomics, noted to Cointelegraph in a joint statement to Cointelegraph that there are certain scenarios that are likely to engender the increased likelihood of consolidated crypto custody:

“Concentration of custody in and of itself is not necessarily disastrous, but concentration of assets increases the impact of black swan events. Given the lack of clear regulations in the crypto space, this risk is heightened even more than in traditional finance.”

Diverging assessments

As there seems to be some degree of agreement among industry experts with regard to what is happening on the crypto custody front, opinions differ considerably about what the consolidation trend means for the industry. Generally, the valence of evaluations hinges on whether the speaker views the arrival of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space as a positive thing or otherwise.

Jill Carlson, the co-founder of Open Money Initiative, articulated the feelings of the angst-ridden part of the community, wondering if the trend toward consolidated crypto custody was a step in the direction of “recreating the same, broken financial system.” Mike Poutre, managing partner at a blockchain-focused hedge fund Terraform Capital told Cointelegraph that he sees the Wall Street agenda behind the growth of crypto custody sector, saying:

“The big banks and brokerage firms want to introduce custodial relationships so they can produce more products to sell their existing customers. Their motivation is revenue based – pure and simple. Governments want to introduce custodial relationships so they can maintain their control over their citizens — pure and simple. Crypto purists should be very worried. Wall Street will most likely win this. Coinbase’s recent acquisition shows the writing on the wall.”

Lars Seier Christensen, chairman of the blockchain network Concordium, is skeptical about the very idea of outsourcing the custodial function to a third party in the domain of crypto finance. According to Christensen’s statement to Cointelegraph:

“It is a somewhat strange discussion as one of the main advantages with crypto is that you are your own custodian, per definition. Picking an external custodian is just introducing another point of failure and risk. This is only relevant for non-professional players in the industry — which may of course include some institutions that are not very serious about the space. In my view the role of being a custodian is vastly overestimated and there are far too many of those projects out there compared to potential clients.”

Institutional investment vs. ideological purity

Paradoxically, in order to get anywhere close to making the dream of an open, decentralized financial system come true, the crypto industry has to cooperate with the old guard that it aspires to eventually take down. Some experts who spoke to Cointelegraph on the matter saw the expansion of concentrated custody as a compromise between the crypto movement’s foundational ideas and the need to funnel institutional money into the space for the sake of mainstream adoption. RockX’s Lam said:

“Concerns that this marks a centralization of the cryptocurrency market are, to an extent, valid. However, if we are truly dedicated to bringing the cryptocurrency revolution mainstream, it is necessary to welcome institutional actors into the space.”

If the cryptocurrency industry is indeed hoping for institutional investors to join in, then the infrastructure has to be present. Maxon of CoolBitX commented regarding this:

“If we are aiming for cryptocurrency to become a viable alternative to the existing financial system, regulated custodian services will become necessary. With that, however, the industry could come to resemble aspects of the old order to which it was born to oppose.”

Other observers contend that adding a centralized layer on top of the crypto ecosystem’s decentralized foundation is nothing criminal, as Hans Sundby, head of crypto for blockchain protocol Geeq, told Cointelegraph, “A custodian is just a third party that offers a regulatory compliant, secure and efficient way of handling large investments and holdings.” CEO and founder of the Credits Blockchain platform Igor Chugunov told Cointelegraph that custody is something the crypto community will have to accept:

“It is not an attempt to copy someone, it is an attempt to cope with the issues that concern the audience of new investors, which the market of crypto needs. Moreover, we should take into account the strict security requirements demanded by regulators. Application of custody makes sense to me: the end justifies the means.”

Twitter user Oded Leiba noted that the emergence of crypto custodians is in line with the renowned computer scientist Hal Finney’s 2010 prediction that “Bitcoin banks” would arrive at some point, creating an arrangement in which the original cryptocurrency is used for interbank transactions while consumers deal with the second-level, derivative digital asset system. Perhaps far-fetched 10 years ago, such a prophecy doesn’t sound unfeasible today.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/telx-technologies-launches-first-crypto-facilitating-sim-card,"Cryptocurrency and telecommunications company Telx Technologies announced the launch of the first crypto SIM card wallet that enables transactions via SMS.

According to the company’s Medium post published on Aug. 22, the card allows its users to send cryptocurrencies via SMS with their dedicated crypto phone number. Notably, these transactions do not require a smartphone or an active Internet connection. On the other hand, the system also offers no control over a user’s crypto wallet.

Crypto transactions on “dumbphones”

As the crypto community tried to teach those new to the space during the “Proof of Keys” event in January, there are significant disadvantages in not having direct control over a wallet. More precisely, placing one’s assets in a wallet managed by a third party forgoes the trustless, decentralized and disintermediated nature of the technology involved, according to many crypto enthusiasts.

That being said, having your private keys managed by a third party often enables a higher degree of user-friendliness. Telx also mentioned this in its announcement:

“At Telx our goal is to make transacting digital currency as easy and accessible as possible. This means creating solutions that technical and non technical people alike can adopt. We believe there is tremendous synergy between payments and messaging.”

Everything new is well-forgotten old

Per the Medium post, the crypto SIM card is available in over 180 countries, allows unlimited SMS messaging and supports Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), DASH, Zcash (ZEC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). To execute a crypto transaction via this service, its user can send an SMS to any phone number.

Lastly, the company promises to prevent SIM swapping and phone number porting, to accept transactions originating only from the proper SIM card, to protect the wallet with a dedicated PIN number and to provide backup keys in case of a theft or loss.

As Cointelegraph reported in May, Sean Coonce, engineering manager at cryptocurrency custodian BitGo, announced that he became a victim of a SIM swapping hack.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-fights-to-hold-10k-support-while-altcoins-see-drops,"Saturday, Aug. 24 — Crypto markets continued to see red as Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below the $10,000 price mark several times within 12 hours.

Mark Carney weighs in

Yesterday, the Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said that a digital currency such as Facebook’s not-yet-launched cryptocurrency Libra could replace the United States dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Anthony Pompliano, founder of crypto investment firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets, pointed out that the supportive stance to Libra from the British regulator and central bank indicates the rapid adoption of crypto. He wrote on Twitter:

“It only took 10 years for central bankers to go from unaware of digital currencies to calling for one as the global reserve currency. This is moving much faster than almost anyone expected.”

Commenting on Carney’s recent call for a global monetary system to replace the U.S. dollar, crypto and blockchain expert Joseph Young noted that it is a “very interesting time for bitcoin and gold” as the currency war is intensifying alongside rising geopolitical risks.

Young added that while Bitcoin’s short-term price trend seems heading downward, there is a chance that more investors will take a better look at alternative stores of value as foreign exchange wars rage on.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/send-token-payouts-with-ease-using-bitcoin-coms-slp-dividend-calculator/,"Send Token Payouts With Ease Using Bitcoin.com's SLP Dividend Calculator

On August 23, Bitcoin.com released a new application called the SLP Dividend Calculator. The new platform allows users to build a transaction to make dividend payments to any Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) token holder.

Also read: How to Create Non-Fungible Assets and Collectible Tokens With Bitcoin Cash

Testing the New SLP Dividend Calculator From Bitcoin.com

Over the last year, SLP tokens have been extremely popular among BCH proponents, and so far supporters have made thousands of unique coins on the BCH chain. As time has progressed, the SLP ecosystem has matured a great deal and there are many third-party solutions supporting the token infrastructure. This week, Bitcoin.com added a new platform to our Tools.Bitcoin.com portal called the SLP Dividend Calculator. The application provides users with the ability to make grouped dividend payments to specific SLP token holders. For instance, if you distributed fractions of an SLP token to a group of three people, then you could enter the token’s ID and send funds to all three holders at a specific point in time. With the ability to pay BCH dividend payments to SLP token holders, the new tool opens the door to all kinds of real-world use cases.

After the new tool was released, I decided to test the service in order to highlight just how easy it is to use the new Bitcoin.com SLP Dividend Calculator. I tested the app with my cousin, Andrew Brow, because back in June I sent him some custom SLP tokens called “Andy Coin (ABC)” just to show him how simple it is to create tokens. At the time I created 21 million ABC coins and sent 10 million to my cousin’s Badger wallet. Last night I opened up the SLP Dividend Calculator and pasted the token’s unique ID number into the first window.

Sent an SLP dividend payment flawlessly just now. Sent the funds and paid the unique payment code that said ""Paying 0.003176 #BCH to holders of SLP Token ID…"" It paid perfectly splitting the funds between addresses, confirming in 1 block. Was also a Schnorr transaction. 👏 pic.twitter.com/CnpIpjrB2g — Jamie Redman (@jamieCrypto) August 24, 2019

Then I decided to pay $1 to the Andy Coin token holders, which means it will be split in half between both of us, because we are both ABC token holders. The SLP Dividend Calculator can pay a lot more than just two addresses, but for this test two was enough. After making sure the SLP token ID and the number of funds I wanted to send were correct, I decided to make the funds available at the last confirmed block height. You can also choose to broadcast it as is in the latest mempool state or you can choose a custom block height as well.

The service gives you two choices after the customization is complete: you can either press the button “Start over” or “Build the transaction.” After I chose to build the transaction, the application showed me exactly what would happen after I paid the unique payment invoice. The SLP balances were scanned at block height 597121 and I sent a dividend payment of 0.003176 BCH, which would be paid to the token holders of the Andy Coin token ID number. The platform also told me that two addresses would receive a BCH dividend payment after I paid the QR invoice code through Pay.Bitcoin.com. Any wallet that supports invoices, like the Bitcoin.com Wallet, can pay the invoice by copying the URI scheme or scanning the QR code. I used the Electron Cash wallet to pay the invoice, because I had some available funds in the wallet and I wanted to see exactly how the transaction was built and executed from the client perspective.

Opening the Door to a Decentralized Stock Market, Trust Payments and Bearer Bonds

After paying the invoice, the transaction broadcasted and my cousin Andrew and I were both sent $0.50 in BCH each. The transactions confirmed in the following block and the entire test can be seen on Bitcoin.com’s Block Explorer or Simpleledger.info as well. The tool could be used for a variety of interesting dividend payment ideas. For instance, Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman, Roger Ver, recently sent BCH dividend payments to Cashgames.Bitcoin.com Dividend Test Token (CGT) holders for being Cashgames.Bitcoin.com patrons.

A person with four children could create four separate non-fungible (NFT1) tokens with the kids’ names attached to them and call them Trust Tokens. After a specific block height, the Trust Tokens can be sent a BCH dividend payment in order to leave an inheritance to the children. Or a business could have people invest in the company by initiating an initial coin offering (ICO) and token holders could reap the profits in the form of dividend payments over time.

The sky’s the limit when it comes to the variety of concepts that can derive from people using the Bitcoin.com SLP Dividend Calculator. Since the application was launched, a bunch of BCH supporters have tested the platform to send funds to certain token holders. “Fantastic,” one BCH enthusiast wrote on the Reddit forum r/btc. “[This] gives us decentralized stock market… dead easy to use.”

“Holy crap the new SLP dividend tool is awesome. Just played around with it and sent all holders of the MIS token their share of .01 BCH just to test it out,” another BCH user said on Twitter. “This is magic internet money for reals.” If you have created SLP tokens you can try sending a dividend payment to token holders by using the SLP Dividend Calculator. The process takes less than two minutes to complete and you don’t need to be a tech wiz to use the new tool. Check out the platform at Tools.Bitcoin.com and send your first BCH dividend payment today.

The opinions expressed here are the author’s own. The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter for institutional investors focused on crypto assets. You can sign up here.

It’s one of the worst-kept secrets in the alternative investment industry: net of fees, hedge funds struggle to outperform broad equity markets.

In 2007, before bitcoin was even a glimmer in Satoshi Nakamoto’s eye, Warren Buffet famously bet a prominent fund of hedge fund manager $1 million that over the subsequent decade, an S&P 500 index fund would outperform any basket of hedge funds he could put together. Buffet won handily.

It’s not that Buffet didn’t think there were capable investment managers out there; Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway has often been described as a giant hedge fund. Instead, his confidence relied on his intuition that between fees and trading costs, even the best hedge fund managers would struggle to beat a low-cost index fund.

We might logically assume that crypto hedge funds, which generally have a 2 and 20 fee structure similar to that of their traditional counterparts, would suffer a similar fate.

But since the beginning of 2017, when reliable data became available, the result has been quite the opposite. An equal-weighted index of crypto funds significantly outperformed bitcoin and most other crypto assets.

The CFR Crypto Fund Index tracks more than 40 crypto funds, mostly hedge funds, across a variety of strategies. It shows that even as bitcoin climbed about 1,000 percent between January 2017 and June 2019, crypto funds gained more than 1,400 percent.

The outsized performance of crypto funds over this period might puzzle the Oracle of Omaha, a man who once described bitcoin as “rat poison squared.” Even without Buffet’s bias against crypto or hedge funds, there are a few reasons one might be surprised:

Performance fees are by nature punitive to returns during bullish periods

Creating a portfolio that can outperform skyrocketing single assets is no small feat

Crypto fund managers tend to be less experienced than their traditional counterparts

Despite these apparent headwinds, crypto funds did outperform. So let’s examine these perceptions a bit more.

Performance fees are too punitive in bull markets

Few investment assets have ever experienced a 12-month bull run like that of crypto assets in 2017.

That’s fantastic for fund managers taking home 20 percent of profits, but certainly eats away at returns. Several crypto funds returned more than 1,000 percent in 2017 – meaning by year-end a fund manager could have taken home more in fees than the fund had assets to start the year.

Still, most crypto funds have a 2 and 20 fee structure similar to traditional hedge funds and many have high water marks (essentially to ensure managers don’t get paid for performance when a fund is below all-time high).

So while crypto fund performance fees have been staggering in absolute terms, the fee structure is no more of a hindrance to crypto funds than to traditional hedge funds.

Diversified portfolios struggle to keep up with single assets

It’s hard to imagine any asset overshadowing bitcoin’s 12x performance in 2017. But that’s exactly what happened. Some other coins were up 100x or more. The Bitwise CCI 30 Index, which measures the performance of the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, was up 42x.

So how exactly did crypto funds outperform during 2017? They didn’t. Not even close.

Crypto funds collectively returned a relatively underwhelming 1,000 percent. Sure, these funds returned more in 2017 than traditional hedge funds have in the past 20 years. But everything is relative. And relative to top cryptocurrencies, crypto funds had a disappointing year.

The story of crypto funds’ outperformance truly began when crypto winter cast a chill over the entire industry in 2018. Philanthropist and investor Shelby Cullom Davis said: “You make most of your money in a bear market, you just don’t realize it at the time.”

It was one heck of a bear market.

In 2018, bitcoin lost nearly 75 percent of its value. The CCI 30 Index lost 85 percent. The CFR Crypto Fund Index, however, was down “only” 33 percent. Or put another way, while crypto funds preserved 4/6 of their value, the CCI 30 maintained less than 1/6 of its value. As the chart above shows, this ability to preserve capital during 2018 propelled the crypto fund index ahead of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

From Q1 2017 through Q2 2019, the CFR Crypto Fund Index has returned 1,430 percent. This easily bests bitcoin’s 1,022 percent return and narrowly surpasses the 1,413 percent of the CCI 30.

Crypto funds lack experience

After overcoming their fee structures and whipsawing crypto markets, crypto fund managers had a final hurdle to overcome: inexperience. It’s difficult to directly compare the total financial experience of managers across disciplines. However, we can look at the average age of funds.

A recent study published by Loyola Marymount University (LMU) found the median age of traditional hedge funds was 52 months. This is a lifetime in the crypto world. No crypto funds in the CFR index have been operational for 52 months and the median age is just 16 months.

This inexperience should hurt crypto fund returns, right? Not necessarily. Somewhat counterintuitively, the same LMU study found traditional hedge fund returns decrease with age. And not by a negligible margin. Hedge fund returns in year one were more than triple those in year five. After year five, the study found, “some funds become liquidated and the pattern is somewhat mixed.”

So inexperience, which would seem to be a significant headwind for crypto fund managers, may actually have been a tailwind propelling their performance past ahead of bitcoin and other benchmarks.

Reasons for caution

That crypto funds have outperformed various benchmarks is encouraging. But there’s also plenty of reason for institutions to remain cautious.

The index covers barely one market cycle. Buffet’s index fund didn’t take the lead over hedge funds until year four of the ten-year bet.

The index has less than 50 constituent funds. While the largest in the industry, it’s quite small compared to traditional hedge fund performance indices which can include thousands of funds.

There are potential biases. Since reporting is voluntary, and the index includes less than 20 percent of eligible funds, we can reasonably assume that poorly performing funds are less likely to report. Funds with particularly poor performance might have already closed, creating a potential survivorship bias. Though not unique to crypto fund indices, these biases shouldn’t be overlooked by investors.

Most crypto funds are quite small by traditional standards and it’s quite possible some strategies that perform well in illiquid markets will not support the same type of returns with more capital invested. Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund manages over $100 billion. Crypto funds manage less than $20 billion collectively.

Despite the potential issues, it’s encouraging that crypto hedge funds seem to have done more or less what they are supposed to, namely preserve capital in bear markets. And with the majority of crypto funds in the index now employing outside auditors, custodians and fund administrators, the industry is becoming less haphazard.

The crypto fund industry is still very much in a maturation phase, but with proper due diligence, crypto funds may present institutions, particularly those unwilling or unable to directly custody cryptoassets, an appealing way to get exposure to the sector.

Some decentralized architecture is said to have an “Oracle Problem”, but at least so far, crypto funds don’t seem to have an Oracle of Omaha problem.

Fiat and cryptocurrency via Shutterstock",2019-08-24 12:30:02+00:00,https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/data-shows-that-bitcoin-and-chainlink-have-highest-number-of-profitable-investors/,"Bitcoin has been on a wild ride over the past several years, and despite a continuous influx of new participants into the nascent crypto market, many investors who jumped onboard in late-2017 and early-2018 have been badly burned by the recent bear market.

Now, newly released data elucidates that Bitcoin and Chainlink have the highest number of investors that are currently profitable, while other cryptocurrencies – including Ethereum and Zcash – have a shocking number of investors who are currently at a loss.

Bitcoin Investors are Widely Profitable – Despite Massive Volatility

Although Bitcoin has grown notorious for its massive volatility, while looking at its price action on a year-to-year basis, the vast majority of this volatility has been bullish, and the crypto is only trading down roughly 50% from its all-time-highs – which is significantly better than many altcoins that are trading down 80% or more from their all-time-highs.

Now, newly released data from intotheblock shows that of all crypto wallets with a positive balance, Bitcoin and Chainlink both have the highest number of profitable investors, while Zcash currently has the most investors who are currently at a loss.

Alex Krüger, a popular economist on Twitter who focuses primarily on cryptocurrencies, broke down this data in a recent tweet, pointing to the below graphic that shows the in-depth data regarding both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

“For any address with a positive balance, @intotheblock identifies avg price at which tokens were acquired, indicating if the address is at profit or loss. Addresses at profit: $BTC 79% – $LINK 56% Addresses at loss: $ETH 74% – $ADA 75% – $ICX 94% – $FET 93% – $ZEC 95%,” Krüger explained.

This data shows just how poorly altcoins have been performing in the time since the 2017 bull run as, with the exception of Chainlink, many major altcoins still have a massive number of investors that may not be able to sell their holdings at a profit for a significant amount of time.

It is not surprising, however, that Bitcoin has the highest number of profitable investors, as its status as the first cryptocurrency means that many investors purchased the crypto prior to the bull run and subsequent crash in 2017/2018.

Additionally, Bitcoin’s positive price performance over the first half of 2019 likely bolstered the number of profitable BTC investors, and its present dominance over the crypto market signals that its recent rally was likely driven from a mass exodus away from altcoins.",2019-08-24 23:27:12+03:00,https://www.coindesk.com/ftc-settles-with-promoters-of-multi-level-marketing-crypto-scheme,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), has settled charges it filed last year against four promoters of crypto-denominated multi-level marketing schemes.

Following a federal trial in a Florida court, the operators of the fraudulent investment schemes are ordered to pay restitution and have been barred from operating or participating in other such MLM schemes, according to a statement made by the FTC on August 22.

Under the corporate names Bitcoin Funding Team and My7Network, the fraudsters promoted their crypto investment schemes by misrepresenting potential earnings. They used social media, YouTube and conference calls to promote the scams.

In one instance, investors were promised $80,000 in monthly income from an initial investment of $100.

Thomas Dulca, Eric Pinkston, Louis Gatto and Scott Chandler sat at the top of a pyramid scheme. In order to stay in operation, investors were encouraged to recruit new participants. Though promised large rewards, most participants “failed to recoup their initial investment.”

In addition to his promotion of Bitcoin Funding Team, Chandler advertised for Jetcoin, “which promised participants a fixed rate of return, but failed to deliver on these claims,” the FTC alleged.

Dulca and Pinkston are required to pay $453,932 and $461,035, respectively, though Pinkston’s, who is unable to pay the full amount, will be suspended upon payment of $29,491. Chandler is ordered to pay $31,000.

It is unconfirmed whether Gatto will pay a settlement for his involvement in the chain referral schemes.

In 2018, the FTC successfully petitioned the court to freeze the fraudster’s assets. The U.S. regulator also asked the court to order the defendants to stop working together or creating new business entities.

As part of the settlement, the men are barred from ever “operating, participating in, or assisting others in promoting or operating any multi-level marketing program, pyramid, Ponzi, or chain referral scheme.” They are also barred from misrepresenting investment opportunities.

According to the official blog, currently Binance is “actively contacting all potential victims with [...] guidance on privacy protection and restitution,” and highly recommends “affected users to apply for new identification documents in their respective region.” The post also states:

“We are compensating affected users with a lifetime Binance VIP membership, including preferential trading fees, support, and more services.”

When a hacker knows your customer

As Cointelegraph reported recently, Binance said that its investigation of a KYC data leak that occurred in the beginning of August is still ongoing. The exchange’s security and investigations team is purportedly trying to identify the source of KYC images similar to those leaked by an unidentified hacker.

Binance announced the leak on Aug. 7, stating that an unidentified individual threatened the platform and demanded 300 bitcoins (BTC) in exchange for withholding over 10,000 photographs of purported Binance KYC data.

Cryptocurrency exchanges often require users to submit an image of themselves presenting credentials in order to verify their identity.

Binance also states that some of the leaked images overlap with the images that were processed by a third party vendor the exchange contacted several times from early December 2018 to late February 2019.",,,,

Top Stories This Week

With Facebook tangled up in regulatory tape and putting Libra on ice, others are seizing the chance to leapfrog the social network and launch their own stablecoins. Walmart’s at it, the People’s Bank of China’s at it, and Binance is now throwing its hat into the ring. The crypto exchange says Venus is an open blockchain project that will focus on developing localized stablecoins worldwide. Binance believes it’s in a strong position because of its existing public chain technology and wide user base. The ambitious venture will put the exchange toe to toe with Mark Zuckerberg’s tech behemoth — and although Venus could end up enjoying a headstart in the sprint to launch a stablecoin, Facebook will easily be able to recoup lost ground when it launches. Or, er, if it launches.

Even as Libra languishes, Zuckerberg is continuing to pursue digital payments far away from meddling politicians in the U.S. Over in Indonesia, Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp is in early stage talks with fintech firms and a state-owned bank to support payments through digital wallets in the region. The tech giant has gingerly confirmed that conversations are currently taking place but refused to share any more specifics. Sources told Reuters that negotiations are currently underway with the transportation booking service Go-Jek, mobile payments provider DANA, fintech startup OVO and state-owned bank Mindri, which operates a digital wallet service. A service is expected to launch in 2020 — that said, this was when Libra was supposedly going to be unveiled to the masses.

In news that’s likely to send a shiver down the spine of altcoin evangelists, new research suggests that Bitcoin’s (BTC) true market dominance may have been drastically underestimated. While mainstream crypto data aggregators claim the world’s biggest digital currency has a 70% slice of the market, analysts at Arcane Research believe BTC dominance is actually more than 90%. It says market capitalization is a “meaningless measure” when liquidity isn’t taken into account, and boffins used trading volume in order to make their recalculations. This doesn’t look good for other cryptocurrencies hoping to compete with Bitcoin — and it could have ramifications for investors, not to mention those developing infrastructure for payments.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang is fed up of standing in queues and waiting to vote in elections. The blockchain advocate has vowed to implement blockchain-based mobile voting if he wins the 2020 race, with ledgers used to verify the results. Yang shrugged off fraud concerns by pointing out that the old-fashioned ballot box can equally be susceptible to manipulation — and he said blockchain ballots have the potential to “revolutionize true democracy and increase participation to include all Americans.” The politician envisages his cutting-edge solution running alongside humble polling places. But given the fact that Yang’s support level currently stands at 1.8%, according to RealClearPolitics, U.S. voters might be standing in those pesky lines for some time yet.

Although BTC has veered into the $9,000s several times over the past week, it has managed to consolidate $10,000 support. Prices briefly flirted near $11,000 before tumbling again — and bullish sentiment at the start of the week fizzled with it. Bitcoin made gains as the weekend approached, potentially helped by the fact that the U.S.-China trade war has escalated yet again, with President Donald Trump planning to raise tariffs on Chinese imports worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Some analysts believe that economic uncertainty in traditional markets helps elevate BTC’s status as a store of value — prompting its comparison to “digital gold.”

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $10,141.93, Ether at $190.96 and XRP at $0.27. The total market cap is at $265,628,172,936.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are Vsync, bitqy and Decentralized Asset Trading Platform. The top three altcoin losers of the week are SounDAC, SealBlock Token and BitBall.

Most Memorable Quotations

“Scalability is a big bottleneck because the Ethereum blockchain is almost full.” Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder

“It’s ridiculous that in 2020 we are still standing in line for hours to vote in antiquated voting booths. It is 100% technically possible to have fraud-proof voting on our mobile phones today using the blockchain.” Andrew Yang, Democratic presidential candidate



""I think there is a day in the future where we can't live without crypto, or imagine a world before crypto."" Cameron Winklevoss, Bitcoin bull

“You have all these currencies, new currencies coming into play. [...] I call them ‘psycho currencies,’ because it’s a matter of faith whether you believe in Bitcoin or any of the other cyber-currencies. I think with the rise of that, there’s going to be a demand for real, hard assets, and that includes gold.” Mark Mobius, frontier markets investor

“We're at a tipping point now where Bitcoin is here to stay. It’s going to end up being in every institutional investor’s portfolio.” Anthony Pompliano, Morgan Creek Digital Assets co-founder

“When Bitcoin became well known, many questioned its legitimacy, and while the jury is still out on the future of Bitcoin, I do believe currencies with a blockchain base will continue to surface and may become more widely accepted across the globe.” Glenn Fogel, CEO of Booking Holdings

“The risk with anonymous transactions is one that we all know well. We know this from 9/11 and terror activity that took place in the 15 years preceding that where we didn’t have good tracking, we didn’t have the capacity to understand money flows and who was moving money.” Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary of State

“When you think about really severe crises taking place, a liquidity crunch, another global financial crisis, I think that Bitcoin will struggle to do very well from a price perspective.” Spencer Bogart, general partner at Blockchain Capital

Prediction of the Week

The handbags were out in force as gold bug Peter Schiff and crypto advocate Tom Lee faced off on Twitter. A testy exchange began when Schiff wrote that CNBC’s Joe Kernen was wrong to be bullish on Bitcoin. That prompted the CNBC host to remind the crypto skeptic that his long-held prediction of gold being worth $5,000 has yet to materialize — with Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee piling in to describe this forecast as hysterical. Down but not out, Schiff got his claws out and replied: “My gold forecast came a lot closer than your Bitcoin forecast. Plus at least gold will eventually hit 5k. Bitcoin will never hit 50k.” Bemused spectators voiced their confusion given that Schiff owns BTC and accepts it as a payment method in his gold business.

FUD of the Week

“The United States is in the midst of an unparalleled epidemic of addiction and death.” That was the White House’s stark reminder in advisories to financial institutions and digital payment platforms warning that fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are being purchased using major cryptocurrencies. The documents said “convertible virtual currencies” — such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and Monero — are popular payment methods for illicit substances, many of which are sourced from China. Given how crypto transactions “generate a significant variety of information elements that may be extremely useful to law enforcement,” financial institutions are being urged to collect details linked to suspicious transactions and pass them on to the authorities.

CCTV footage has shown two people stealing a Bitcoin ATM in Washington, D.C. The camera caught the pair entering a mall, taking the machine, carrying it into a van and driving away — with passersby seemingly paying little attention. Although the suspects had timed their theft so surrounding stores were closed, the mall was still open. It took a week for someone to notice that the machine was missing. This is the latest incident in a recent spike in Bitcoin banditry — but that said, it was more successful than some of the other attempts. In July, a gang of bungling burglars raided a Bitcoin exchange in the British city of Birmingham and tried to steal a Bitcoin ATM using a rope attached to their car. Alas, they left empty-handed.

The Reserve Bank of India is feeling the heat over how it handled a ban targeting cryptocurrency businesses. The country’s Supreme Court has ruled that the central bank inadequately responded to the industry’s concerns when it banned banks from servicing crypto operators in July 2018. Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman has given the RBI two weeks to explain what was going on at the time. This comes as the country’s government is considering making crypto illegal for all citizens — with potential jail terms of up to 10 years proposed for those who flout the law.

They almost have to be, given their adherents’ gargantuan ambition of fundamentally changing how the world works. This means they attract charlatans, lunatics, frauds, and false prophets, and furious battles are waged over doctrinal hairsplitting; but it also means they inspire intransigent beliefs which can, and do, unify many thousands of wildly different people across continents and time zones.

This occurred to me while I was rereading Gibbon’s Decline and Fall, as one does, and in particular its depictions of the early days of the Christian faith:

But whatever difference of opinion might subsist between the Orthodox [church], the Ebionites, and the Gnostics, concerning the divinity or the obligation of the Mosaic law, they were all equally animated by the same exclusive zeal; and by the same abhorrence for idolatry ..,. the established religions of Paganism were seen by the primitive Christians in a much more odious and formidable light. It was the universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics, that the daemons were the authors, the patrons, and the objects of idolatry.

For Orthodox church, Ebionites, and Gnostics, you can read perhaps, “Bitcoin maximalists”, “Blockchain not bitcoin,” and “Ethereum maximalists.” They disagree bitterly, but one view they all share is a disdain verging and frequently exceeding contempt for fiat currencies, untokenized assets, and most other aspects of money and finance as they are currently constructed. Instead they share a deep belief in the superiority, and inevitable supremacy, very different world.

The superstitious observances of public or private rites were carelessly practised, from education and habit, by the followers of the established religion. But as often as they occurred, they afforded the Christians an opportunity of declaring and confirming their zealous opposition. By these frequent protestations their attachment to the faith was continually fortified; and in proportion to the increase of zeal, they combated with the more ardor and success in the holy war, which they had undertaken against the empire of the demons.

I think few will disagree that, similarly, many cryptocurrency devotees seek out and seize every “opportunity of declaring and confirming their zealous opposition” to government money, central banks, rival maximalists, and other features of the monetary, financial, and/or centralized status quo.

The careless Polytheist, assailed by new and unexpected terrors, against which neither his priests nor his philosophers could afford him any certain protection, was very frequently terrified and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures. His fears might assist the progress of his faith and reason; and if he could once persuade himself to suspect that the Christian religion might possibly be true, it became an easy task to convince him that it was the safest and most prudent party that he could possibly embrace.

Similarly I don’t think it’s controversial to note that prophecies of the hyperinflation and collapse of national currencies, the downfall of central banks and fractional reserve banking in general, etc., are not unheard of among some of the … edgier … cryptocurrency people. One might even refer to the notion of “preaching the gospel” of deflationary, censorship-resistant cryptocurrency, sometimes in the hopes of scaring everyone who hears this doomsaying into buying some Bitcoin as a hedge.

Of course the religious parallels do not end with Gibbon. Cryptocurrencies were given to us not by a known, living, breathing, flawed human being, but by a pseudonymous verging-on-mythical quasi-demigod. (Cf eg “Satoshi’s Vision.”) Mythically speaking, that’s easily analogized to Prometheus granting humanity fire, or Moses bringing the stone tablets down from Mount Sinai. They have real and false prophets. There’s even a “Bitcoin Jesus.” And all promise a better world tomorrow, while demanding sacrifices and inconveniences today.

My tongue is obviously in cheek here — but I’m not entirely unserious. Of course all money is ultimately backed by faith (cf “full faith and credit.”) But this is I think unquestionably more true of cryptocurrencies, especially because, a decade on from their creation, they have failed — so far! — to transform the world to a degree anything like their proclaimed potential.

Bitcoin itself is apparently going from strength to strength, as can be seen in its increasing dominance of total cryptocurrency market capitalization, but it’s still beyond tiny compared to the rest of the financial world. Its total trading volume as I write this is roughly ~$15 billion per day, which admittedly sounds like a lot, but compared to the $5.1 trillion a day for the forex market as a whole, it’s roughly one-quarter of one percent.

More importantly, Bitcoin continues to technically iterate (although I’ve grown skeptical about Lightning, which it seems to me will always suffer from all the end-user inconveniences of prepaid credit cards, with few balancing advantages) and has hovered near or above $10,000 in value for months now. But the uncertainties and investigations regarding Tether remain a threatening cloud on its horizon.

As for other cryptocurrencies, though — well, these are complex times.

Ethereum, the best-known and perhaps most interesting, has gone from a wave of DAO excitement shortly after its launch, which faltered, to a wave of ICO madness and “fat protocol” DApps (decentralized applications), which also faltered, to the latest wave and watchword, “DeFi” aka decentralized finance. This essentially aims to reinvent all of Wall Street and the City of London on the blockchain(s), in the long term.

Meanwhile, the technical underpinnings that would allow Ethereum to scale to Wall Street size, known as “Ethereum 2.0,” remain more notional than real. I’m a big fan of Ethereum (my own pet crypto project is built on it) and I don’t think DeFi is doomed to failure … but under the circumstances I can understand skepticism creeping in among those who are not true believers.

There are plenty of other technically interesting cryptocurrency initiatives: from privacy coins such as ZCash, Monero, and Grin, to the use of Tezos by Brazil’s fifth largest bank for security tokens (again, DeFi), to the growth and stabilization of Cosmos’s “internet of blockchains,” to Blockstack’s total-app-installs graph beginning to look a little more exponential than linear, albeit with still-tiny y-axis numbers.

However, I think it’s also fair to say that now that cryptocurrencies are no longer new, unknown, and fascinating, interest among both individuals and enterprises who are not true believers has waned considerably. The cultural whiplash one experiences when transitioning from a conference full of people convinced they are building a new technology that will transform the fundamental order of the world, to outsiders (even technical outsiders) remarking “oh, is that still a thing?” is increasingly sharp.

That was probably true of the Christians after they ceased to be new and interesting, though, and in the end the Christians conquered the most powerful empire in the world from within. I am definitely not prophesying the same outcome here. I continue to think cryptocurrencies will remain a financial alternative, albeit a very significant and important one, used only by a few percent of people.

But I am saying that seeming increasingly distant from the external consensus reality, being driven by intransigent and sometimes bewildering faith as much as rational analysis, and ongoing associations with a cloud of crazy scandal and hangers-on snake-oil salespeople — all of which would be catastrophic signs for, say, a traditional new startup — can actually be indicators of the strength, not weakness, of a strange new religion. Something to bear in mind as we move into the second decade of cryptocurrencies.",2019-08-25,https://news.bitcoin.com/immortality-cryogenics-and-ubi-how-the-crypto-rich-influence-science/,"Immortality, Cryogenics and UBI: How The Crypto Rich Influence Science

The rise of cryptocurrency is changing the philanthropic world by causing the redistribution of wealth from old money to visionary innovators and early tech adopters. The new crypto rich invest their donations by supporting scientific research in groundbreaking fields that may one day enable humanity to cure aging, reverse death and completely change the relationship between work and income.

The Cryptorati Want to Defeat Aging

Examining the record of donations made by the crypto rich reveals a pattern of support for goals that others may feel belong in the pages of science fiction novels. Having benefited greatly from recognizing the potential of peer to peer electronic cash earlier than the masses, it is no surprise that they have great optimism in the power of technology to radically change our lives for the better.

One of the main benefactors of this type of donation focus is the SENS Research Foundation located in Mountain View, California. The non-profit SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) defines its goal as working to develop, promote, and ensure widespread access to therapies that cure and prevent the diseases and disabilities of aging. Unlike the traditional medical approach of only treating or managing old age problems as they kick in, this approach focuses on comprehensively repairing the damage that builds up in our bodies over time, thus mitigating the aging process as much as possible.

In the early 2000s, Michael Novogratz donated to the research organization and the Pineapple Fund gave SENS $2 million in BTC last year. Moreover, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin also donated $2.4 million to SENS in 2018 and another $350,000 in January 2019. The regenerative medical therapy organization also raised another $4.1 million in cryptocurrencies last year in addition to the Pineapple Fund donation.

The chief science officer of SENS, British biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey, talked about the relationship between his venture and crypto proponents last year and detailed that many have donated to the research organization. “I’m not in this to do science for the sake of doing science,” de Grey explained. “I’m in it for the ultimate goal.” He further revealed that a few anonymous donors have given SENS $1 million each and other cryptocurrency personalities are also long-term donors of the foundation.

The Cryogenics Connection

Another main benefactor of donations made by crypto personalities is the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. This nonprofit based in Scottsdale, Arizona, advocates for, researches, and performs cryonics. This entails the freezing of the whole human corpse or just the brain in liquid nitrogen after legal death, with hopes of resurrecting the individual when the requisite technology is developed in the future.

According to reports, a number of crypto rich have anonymously donated to Alcor’s cryonics research. The top connection between the field and cryptocurrency is that Alcor might be preserving the body of a man some believe to be Satoshi Nakamoto himself. Hal Finney is the computer scientist who received the very first bitcoin transaction and helped get the network up and running during its first year. On Aug. 28, 2014, Finney’s body was taken to an Alcor facility soon after his death and underwent the cryogenic process. In May 2018 the foundation announced that cryptocurrency enthusiast Brad Armstrong gave it a $5 million research contribution, being held in the name of the “Hal Finney Cryonics Research Fund”.

Another connection between cryptocurrency and cryogenics is that computer scientist Ralph Merkle, known for creating cryptographic hashing, the Merkle tree and other inventions, is also a researcher and advocate of cryonics. He reportedly knows a few crypto people who have donated to cryonics and also helped raise funds for Alcor.

Universal Basic Income and MDMA

A more economic research topic, but one that could have drastic implications for human society no less than curing aging or cheating death, is Universal Basic Income. UBI is one of the hottest economic debate topics of the last couple of years, talked about as a possible solution to technological unemployment, preventing humans from falling behind once robots take over all the jobs. The idea has even gained support from various politicians around the world recently such as U.S. democratic candidate Andrew Yang.

Basically the UBI plan is to provide everyone with a stipend so that they can live their lives without worrying about making enough money from work just to survive. This raises several questions as it goes against how many believe the world should function and it will also be an unprecedented experiment in the human condition. The Pineapple Fund made a $5 million donation to the organization Give Directly in 2017 to sponsor cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty in Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda where it is possible to test the UBI concept before it’s implemented in more expensive regions of the world. The Pineapple Fund has also donated more than $1 million to aid in the research of using MDMA as a treatment for PTSD.

Crypto rich and well-known community personalities have of course donated to other causes than the above mentioned scientific research projects. To list a few examples, Justin Sun gave $3 million to the Binance Charity Foundation, $250,000 to the ALS association and over $4.5 million to Glide which aims to alleviate poverty. John McAfee donated a 27-foot boat worth $1.1 million to the Belize Coast Guard. The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, even signed the Giving Pledge, the drive started by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates for rich people to give away the majority of their wealth instead of leaving it to their heirs.

The illicit operation came to light when the SBU, Ukraine's internal security service, searched the facility last month and uncovered computer equipment set up to ""mine"" the cryptocurrency.

Mining cryptocurrencies is an expensive drain on power as it often requires vast computer servers to solve complex puzzles in exchange for virtual coins.

According to papers filed with the Central District Court in the city of Mykolaev security agents believe details of the 2,850 megawatt plant's security arrangements - which are considered a state secret in Ukraine - could have been leaked when the computers were connected to the Internet.

Ukrainian media suggested those facing charges could include members of the National Guard who were meant to be protecting the site.

The power station, which runs three nuclear reactors, acknowledged that an illicit mining site had been found, but denied a security breach.

""A search was carried out which revealed that in one of the storage rooms, which is used for spare parts for auxiliary equipment, a power plant employee had placed his own computer equipment for cryptocurrency mining,"" the station, which is run by EnergoAtom, Ukraine's nuclear monopoly, said in a statement.",2019-08-25,https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/25/the-teenager-who-made-millions-on-bitcoin-is-staking-it-all-on-this-obscure-token/,"Erik Finman was 12 years old when he bought $1,000 worth of Bitcoin in the summer of 2011. The world’s first digital currency was just two years old and trading for $10, a time when most folks, if they knew about Bitcoin at all, associated it with the dark web drug trade or its fringe fanbase of libertarians, anarchists, and cypherpunks.

A month before he made the purchase, he’d cut a deal with his parents. If he could turn a $1,000 gift from his grandmother into $1 million, he wouldn’t have to attend university. By 2017, he’d won the agreement.

This lucrative decision would give the Idaho native a financial autonomy unfathomable to most teenagers. He dropped out of high school at age 15 to move to San Francisco and found an online education startup, Botangle (which he later sold and then bought back); he also spent his energy on a couple of pet projects, including a Doctor Octopus-inspired robotic tentacle suit and launching a satellite containing pop culture memorabilia from Earth.

As one might expect, the something-of-a-wunderkind’s sudden riches, business stunts, and cocksure-dropout attitude have resulted in a viral notoriety for the young entrepreneur. And he’s drunk the kool-aid of his own internet fame, often hamming up his success on Twitter.

“I’m not even 21. Just wait,” his pinned tweet from June 10 reads.

Well, the “wait” is apparently over. The world’s youngest Bitcoin millionaire recently announced his next big thing: He’s dumping all of his Bitcoin holdings into Metal, a cryptocurrency that launched an ICO in 2017.

“I’m willing to stake it all on Metal,” he told me in an interview. “I’m converting all my crypto money into this coin.”

Metal (MTL) is the token behind Metal Pay, a wallet that lets users store multiple coins and exchange them for USD seamlessly. Finman bills it as “an all-in-one” application for cryptocurrencies. The Venmo-like app lets its users send dollars to each other and earn MTL for their activity on the app (those reward tokens come out of the app’s “PoPP pool,” a trove of 26,000,000 tokens that represents a little over a third of the entire MTL supply).

“It makes crypto sexy,” Finman said, speaking of the application’s sleek design.

It was Metal’s attractive design and founder/CEO Marshall Hayner’s drive to make crypto “sexier” to the general public, that turned Finman on to the project. After liaising on Twitter, the two sat down to a six hour business dinner in June, and Finman left feeling that the encounter had “rekindled [his] love for cryptocurrency.” He had agreed to convert his entire crypto portfolio into MTL tokens and to announce his investment on August 19, the same day Metal Pay finally graduated from beta testing.

Finman told me yesterday that he’s already put “a good amount” of funds into MTL but that he still has 446 Bitcoin (worth about $4.5 million right now), which he plans to move into MTL incrementally. He justified drawing out the process by saying “one big off pump” would create price hype and disrupt any “actual grassroots support” for the platform.

Finman has also taken on a role at the company, although his bio on Metal Pay’s website doesn’t include a job title, so it’s not clear what his function is. “I don’t believe in titles,” he told me. “Just last night I was working on product. I was helping with hiring two days ago. Other times, I’m making videos about announcements. I’m working on anything I physically can because, as you know, we have big goals to say the least.”

Big goals indeed. Finman has boasted that Metal Pay will beat out Libra, Facebook’s ideation on digital currency, and he’s even gone so far as to say that Metal will replace Bitcoin.

“Yeah, these are bold claims,” he told me in an interview Friday. “I thought 10 years ago we’d be a lot further along in the blockchain space [by now].” He sees Metal Pay as the killer app that will finally make cryptocurrency “usable for normal people.”

“I like to say we have dragon energy. I feel like the momentum is here. I’ve really never seen momentum like this happen so quickly, so fast, and even more to come. … We were the number one in trading volume and price gain on Binance yesterday.”

The Metal token enjoyed a $40 to $60 million 24-hour trading volume in the days following Finman’s announcement. For most of July and August, the token was clocking anywhere from $300,000 to a few million dollars in daily trading (save a spike of about $18 million a few days before the announcement). The increased trading activity has bumped the price up to $0.40, nearly double its price a week ago. Like most so-called altcoins in the crypto market, this is a far cry from its all time high (~$13) at the peak of the 2017 market mania.

Also like most altcoins, MTL’s liquidity is thin — even the numbers Finman cites likely have faked volume. (His numbers come from CoinMarketCap, which features exchanges known to spoof volume.) Messari provides what is likely a more accurate data feed, though even this volume might not be completely spot on. Messari, for example, only takes data from three of MTL’s markets because the others don’t meet its standards for data transparency and accuracy; CoinMarketCap lists 18, causing about a $1 million spread between the two.

All of that to say, with MTL’s market cap hovering around $19 million (Bitcoin’s, for comparison, is about $185 billion), it wouldn’t take much to double its price. In fact, MTL’s price has been so flatlined of late that this week’s surge caused barely a blip on its chart.

I asked Finman what he thinks about the price increase, and more pointedly, if this runup was the result of his own buying or of crypto enthusiasts chasing his investment — or both. He said, “I guess people see me and see me backing it and see me believing in it, and seeing the product itself. I think the product really speaks for itself with how beautiful it is.”

Beautiful or not, the MTL token is struggling to find users. Sure, Metal Pay, the wallet, is sleek and functional, and according to Hayner it has 30,000 users who send dollars or exchange cryptocurrencies on the platform (available only on iOS devices; Metal Pay has 2.8k ratings for an average of 4.3 stars on Apple’s App Store). But the token itself has little practical utility. For now, its primary use case is as a rewards system to encourage people to use the app. A less accessible, secondary use case allows users who stake a heap of tokens on their Metal Pay wallet to receive zero-fee trading privileges on the platform.

And Metal doesn’t even have its own blockchain; instead, it runs on the Ethereum chain, although Finman told me that “it won’t for long.” He wouldn’t give more specifics.

So is Metal going to be as hot as Finman thinks it is? Well, it’s clear that Finman’s contributions so far have given the project’s token price a boost. But as for how long the rally lasts and where the token goes from here, well, we’ll see how long the project can run on dragon energy.

You can find him on Twitter @AsILayHodling.",2019-08-25,https://cointelegraph.com/news/internal-revenue-service-sends-new-round-of-letters-to-crypto-holders,"Last week, the United States Internal Revenue Service sent another round of letters to crypto traders called CP2000. These notices were sent to traders of some crypto exchanges due to inconsistencies found in their tax reports.

Using the information provided by third-party systems — such as crypto exchanges and payment systems — the IRS has been able to determine the amounts traders owe and included the amounts in dollars in the notices. Individuals who have received these notices are required to pay within 30 days, starting on the delivery date indicated in the letter.

If you think the exchange — on which you traded — provided your details to the bureau, you are probably right, but do not hold it against the exchanges. The regulation stipulates that all broker and barter exchange services are required by law to annually report trader activity on a 1099-B form, send it directly to the IRS and send a copy to the recipient.

In addition, transaction payment cards and third-party network transactions are also required to report on Form 1099-K, send it directly to the IRS and send a copy to the payee.

The IRS has not yet published specific guidelines for crypto exchanges. In fiat stocks, every broker must submit 1099-B to the IRS and send a copy to the trader. In crypto, the IRS still didn't publish clarification whether exchanges should provide 1099-K or 1099-B.

Exchanges can benefit from the uncertain situation to provide 1099-K — like Coinbase Pro and Gemini — but some do not provide any forms, such as Kraken and Bittrex. Meanwhile, the exchange must provide the users with the 1099-K copy by the end of every January, so they will be available to use it in their capital gains report. The users, at the same time, don't submit the IRS their copy of 1099-K, as they only use this form to calculate and report on their capital gains or loss report.

Similarly, earlier this month, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, has reportedly requested that digital currency exchanges provide it with information about traders' names and transactions, aiming to identify cases of tax evasion.

In the U.S., data gathered from these exchanges is collected by the IRS and compared to every trader’s 1099-K report. If the reports do not match the data provided by the exchanges, the IRS will send the CP2000 notice to traders. The notice includes the amount every trader is expected to pay within 30 calendar days.

What’s more, the notice generally includes interest accrued, which is calculated from the due date of the return to 30 days from the date on the notice. This Interest continues to mount until the amount is paid in full, or the IRS agrees to an alternate amount. It means that interest began on the due date — on the day that you were supposed to report this for the first time. If you should, for example, have included this capital gains on your 2017 report, the interest will start on April 2018 — the last day you should have reported this gain. And it's calculated until the reply date on the CP2000 notice.

Those who received the CP2000 letter have two options:

If the amount proposed is correct:

Complete the response form, sign it and mail it to the IRS along with the tax payment.

If the amount proposed is incorrect:

Complete the response form and return it to the IRS along with a signed statement outlining why you are in disagreement with the amount listed. It is important to include any supporting documentation to your claims.

It is highly recommended to provide a supporting calculation that is comprehensive and includes all wallet activities and transactions carried out on all exchanges in order to have a complete and accurate report as required by the IRS.

You do not need to file an amended return Form 1040X, but if you choose to do so, you should write ""CP2000"" on top of it.

It is important to understand that 1099-K reports for individuals trading crypto can be inaccurate in some cases, and does not include the cost basis, which is crucial for crypto trading calculations.

1099-K only asks for the gross amount of the activity. In crypto reports, you need to know how much it costs you (how much you paid when you bought it) and not only how much you got when you exchanged it. You pay capital gains tax on the profit between the buy amount to the exchange (to fiat or another crypto) amount.

The price you pay for it is called “cost basis.” Without it you will not have an accurate report on crypto. 1099-K forms don't ask this information, only 1099-b forms do.

Therefore, crypto activity must be fully calculated and compared to the previous tax filing before replying to the IRS notice.

Before Bitcoin (BTC) came into existence, billionaire investor Warren Buffett famously placed a $1 million bet (in 2007) that, in the next decade, the S&P 500 index fund would outperform any hedge fund portfolio. The Oracle of Omaha easily won the bet.

Although Buffett might not doubt the competence of investment managers, the various fees and trading costs associated with hedge funds make it difficult for them to perform as well as low-cost index funds.

One could logically assume that digital asset hedge funds, which typically have a 2 and 20 fee structure (like similar traditional investments), would face the same challenges. But since early 2017, an equal-weighted index of cryptocurrency funds has performed a lot better than Bitcoin (BTC) and most other digital currencies.

Bitcoin Up 1,000%, While Crypto Funds Surge 1,400%

The CFR Crypto Fund Index tracks over 40 digital asset funds, primarily hedge funds, across various investment strategies. The index shows that while the Bitcoin price surged around 1,000% between January 2017 and June 2019, crypto asset funds portfolios increased in value by more than 1,400%.

Generally speaking, it’s not easy to create an investment portfolio that will outperform single assets that experience dramatic price increases. Moreover, performance fees are extremely high when compared to returns during bullish market cycles. Most hedge fund managers are also not as experienced as traditional investment professionals.

Despite these challenges, digital asset hedge funds managed to outperform Bitcoin (BTC), Josh Gnaizda, founder of Crypto Fund Research wrote.

Gnaizda pointed out that there are very few investments that have gone through a historic 12-month bull market like that of cryptocurrencies in 2017. This may be a favorable scenario for fund managers as they receive around a 20% cut of the profits.

In 2017, there were several cryptocurrency funds that returned over 1,000%, which suggests that by the end of the year, investment managers could have earned more in fees than the fund had in actual assets to begin with.

2017: Bitcoin Up 12x, Some Other Cryptos Were Up 100x

As explained, most digital asset funds have a 2 and 20 fee structure (like traditional hedge funds and many also have high water marks). This ensures that fund managers don’t earn for performance when a particular fund is below its all-time high.

Even though performance fees have been high, the overall fee structure is not really a hindrance for crypto funds (in the same way it’s not with traditional hedge funds).

Gnaizda, a managerial economics graduate from the University of California, Davis, noted:

“It’s hard to imagine any asset overshadowing Bitcoin’s 12x performance in 2017. But that’s exactly what happened. Some other coins were up 100x or more. The Bitwise CCI 30 Index, which measures the performance of the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap, was up 42x.”

Digital currency funds, combined, yielded a relatively lower return of around 1,000% in 2017. While these funds were more profitable than traditional hedge funds in the last two decades, their performance was not as good as the leading cryptocurrencies.

Crypto Funds Were Better Able to “Preserve Capital” in Bear Markets

During the extended crypto bear market of 2018, Bitcoin lost almost 75% its value from its all-time high. Meanwhile, the CCI 30 Index shed 85% of its value. However, the CFR Crypto Fund Index, only depreciated by 33%.

In other words, as digital asset funds held on to 4/6 of their value, the CCI 30 only managed to keep less than 1/6 of its value (from its all-time high).

Gnaizda observed:

“This ability to preserve capital during 2018 propelled the crypto fund index ahead of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”

Between Q1 2017 and Q2 2019, the CFR Crypto Fund Index is up 1,430% while Bitcoin is up by 1,022%. The CCI 30 returned around 1,413% for the same time period.

However, Gnaizda cautions investors by mentioning that “since reporting is voluntary, and the index includes less than 20 percent of eligible funds, we can reasonably assume that poorly performing funds are less likely to report.”

He added that funds with “particularly poor performance might have already closed, creating a potential survivorship bias.”

The Crypto Fund Research founder further noted:",2019-08-25 11:14:31+03:00,https://www.coindesk.com/what-crypto-and-burning-man-have-in-common,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that crypto aficionados love Burning Man.

Both the long-running festival in the Nevada desert and the bitcoin ethos revolve around openness to exploring new governance models with fewer rules.

Take me, for instance. I still have the colorful Burning Man ticket from 2010, when, like so many future bitcoiners, I went to camp in Black Rock City for a week in late August. Back then, I showed up with little more than a tent, a bikini and a Costco-sized bag of marshmallows to barter for supplies. There were no rules about how to trade these treats or attire myself, so in the free market of campgrounds I did quite well.

These days, you’d be hard-pressed to find rogue attendees. Crypto adherents stick together in their various packs, with elaborate group camps like Camp Decentral, CampDAO and Node Republic, all of which offer blockchain seminars and talks as part of the festival’s offerings.

Crypto entrepreneur Jeremy Gardner told CoinDesk he’s attended the four previous Burning Man festivals and given talks about blockchain technology at these camps.

He often spends time there with Block.One co-founder and former Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce. (Pierce infamously acted out a unicorn-themed wedding ceremony with his wife at the festival.)

“It’s a place to talk about the concepts that are shaping our society,” Gardner said. “I developed closer relationships with people in the crypto community because [Burning Man] is such an incredible bonding experience. But it wasn’t predicated on business. … Blockchain technology is a social movement before it’s a technology.”

Indeed, there’s so much overlap between the crypto community and the Burning Man movement that Gardner joked the market slows to a crawl during the festival, with company announcements waiting until burners return from the desert. (Yet several crypto-holding burners declined to be quoted in this article, concerned they might be associated with Burning Man’s reputation for mind-altering substances and freeform bacchanalia.)

Burning man is a central point of failure for proof-of-stake protocols. — Ryan Selkis (@twobitidiot) August 18, 2019

Both movements growings

Much like the crypto market, Burning Man has evolved dramatically over the past decade.

According to federal tax filings, the Burning Man non-profit garnered $3.7 million (after expenses) in 2017, after acquiring Fly Ranch for $6.5 million in 2016. Roughly 70,000 people are expected to gather in Nevada for the festival this year, which starts Sunday, Aug. 25.

Bear Kittay, a former global ambassador for Burning Man who helped shepherd the annual festival as it established a nonprofit, spawned smaller global events and purchased property, told CoinDesk that Burning Man is still generally dominated by people who work in the tech industry. Kittay is himself a holder of bitcoin and ethereum, plus an investor in the EOS startup Block.One.

“It’s very natural that Burning Man would help inspire and spawn the next generation of leaders in that [tech industry] sense,” Kittay said. “This idea of a decentralized, consensus process that creates an alternative to the nation-state’s central treasuries … is similar to Burning Man. I think you have a ton of people from the ethereum and EOS community and around the world.”

Every year now, an avalanche of articles lament the copious amounts of money and narcotics flowing into the commodification of a supposedly non-capitalist festival. And yes, anyone who has attended will tell you this is a hedonistic playground populated by Silicon Valley elites like Elon Musk.

Yet, From Bitcoin to Burning Man and Beyond author John Clippinger told CoinDesk there may be lessons the festival’s evolution can offer the decentralization movement.

“There was something in the air, the whole idea of self-organizing, autonomous communities,” Clippinger said, describing the early days of both phenomena, adding:

“The challenge of designing these communities is how to keep them open and effective and able to scale, but also to maintain that diversity and resistance to control from people with special interests.”

Burner Tokens

Clippinger said that in 2015 there was discussion among festival organizers about using cryptocurrency as part of the Burning Man experience. (Fiat and other forms of money aren’t allowed for payments on the campgrounds. However, the festival’s flagship nonprofit accepted bitcoin donations in 2014.)

“They had a retreat to specifically look at this, but there was a lot of hostility toward the hyper-libertarian idea of bitcoin,” he said.

Eventually, even the idea of creating a unique token was deemed too controversial for a festival centered on a gift-giving economy. Since festival co-founder Larry Harvey passed away in 2018, Clippinger said the community entered a transitional phase that could determine the future of Burning Man.

“Are they going to build it as a business or keep that same ethos?” Clippinger said. “When it starts to solidify, it gets captured by parties with certain interests. … I think that’s still at the point of exploration.”

One anonymous burner from the ethereum community – a former executive at one of the blockchain industry’s leading companies – told CoinDesk she spent time with several executives at the festival, but would not endorse conducting business in such an environment. (Kittay, on the other hand, connected a startup with investors at the event back in 2011, which led to a Series A raise promptly thereafter.)

The ETH-loving burner added she felt inspired by the concept of Burning Man’s evolving governance.

“Burning Man is itself like a decentralized organization,” she said. “It’s a great example of what you can do outside the system.”

Philosophical overlap

Perhaps old-school burners will complain about how “mainstream” the event has become, but corporate interests appear to be an inherent aspect of market growth.

Kittay, for example, said that so far bitcoin has mostly helped a small group of men accrue wealth, not established a cohesive cultural movement. Kittay and Clippinger both pointed out that Burning Man developed a distinct ethos around free expression and gift-giving economies, while cryptocurrency users often belong to conflicting cultural groups.

From their perspective, bitcoiners are more likely to be libertarian and even ethically capitalist, while other crypto communities like ethereum are passionate about rebuilding economic structures.

These aren’t mutually exclusive, as people like Kittay hold both bitcoin and ether. But they certainly are distinct in terms of the values espoused at meetups, conferences, startups and talks at Black Rock City.

“There are a lot of synergies that exist,” Kittay said of diverse crypto communities. “There is a smorgasbord of people interested in different things for different reasons.”

With regards to ethereum and Burning Man, which share more communal values, he added:

“What we’re talking about here is evolving capitalism from a win-lose dynamic to … a deeper alignment with the planet and moving away from competition. … How do we evolve capitalism to be comprehensive, to account for the true costs?”

Whether crypto entrepreneurs are drawn to the festival by a love of greater freedoms in public spaces, or a desire to “basically save the world” as Kittay put it, all generally agree the next few years will be a decisive time for the evolution of these various projects.

Some call them playgrounds for the rich. Others call them radical social experiments. In reality, they are both.

“No one can point and say we’ve solved that problem,” Clippinger, the Bitcoin to Burning Man author, said, referencing disproportionate influence from profiteering groups. “We’re still working on that issue.”

And there’s nothing quite like the emptiness of a desert, peppered with costumed revelers and the ashes of a spiritual effigy, to inspire such reflection.

My first morning at Burning Man 2010, a topless woman in a pink fuzzy hat approached my tent to share tips with me, the obvious newbie. I’d need more water and sturdier shelter, fast, she said. A movement only grows this way, by sharing knowledge regardless of the recipients’ ability to pay givers back (beyond marshmallows).

Bitcoiners will also need to keep paying it forward to avoid value-capture dominating the system.

It’s a naive, even childish hope to pin on advocates for a new financial asset, the type of “save the world” idiom uttered after a bong rip. But sometimes, when the wind tastes like dust, anything feels possible.

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.

In case you missed it, a new self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto came out of the woodwork last week, this one brandishing a “proof” based on numerology and an obsession with BCCI, the scandal-ridden bank that collapsed in 1991.

The widely debunked “reveal” from Bilal Khalid, aka James Caan – Khalid officially changed his name to that of the American actor – followed a host of equally absurd developments in a Florida court case against the other “Faketoshi,” Craig S. Wright. These included a hand-written note to the judge in which yet another person, one Debo Jurgen Etienne Guido, also laid claim to being bitcoin’s secret progenitor.

Sensible minds in the crypto community remind us that this is all a sideshow, that these competing claims to bitcoin’s creation ultimately mean nothing to its value proposition.

Still, it begs the question: why does it keep happening? Why do the scammers emerge so readily? What is about the crypto community that attracts a parade of false prophets?

Let’s take the question further: why does crypto generate so much drama generally? Bitter feuds over software forks; relentless conspiracy theories; disputes between maximalists, altcoiners, nocoiners and shitcoiners; competing social media memes; token “armies;” Twitter trolls; fraudsters of all kinds – it’s the crypto circus, and many of us secretly love it, at least in doses.

But why? How did a technology spawned by the most math-driven, nerdy and precision-obsessed fields of computer science give rise to Mexican telenovela-like stream of plot twists?

Other open-source tech communities generate their fair share of drama too, of course. (Type in “Linux community” into a Google search and it auto-completes to “Linux community toxic.”) The leaderless structure of open-source projects means there’s no central authority or pooled profit interest policing behavior or managing the external messaging.

Still, the crypto soap opera takes things to another level of madness. Why?

Learning from ancient history

My attempt at an explanation begins with the fact that, unlike other technologies, this is one is fundamentally about money.

“Money has historically been a political process, a process through which people or states or some kind of entity consolidates authority over others,” says Bill Maurer, Dean of Social Sciences at the University of California, Irvine, an anthropologist who has studied the culture and history of money, adding:

“So, you have this big paradox with something like bitcoin, where its very idea is that there shouldn’t be any one person or authority in control…But because of that, you get this cacophony of voices, each claiming to have some kind of truth and striving to be the one in control.”

The unfortunate reality is that while decentralized, blockchain-based monetary systems restrain political or corporate influences over those systems, this restraint only exists on-chain. There’s no way to stop the power plays – the politics – that emerge whenever someone wants to upgrade or fork the software or when different coins compete for users. There is no escaping the politics of money; it doesn’t disappear just because there’s no government in charge of the monetary policy.

Powerful people have always imposed their ideas of money onto others to reinforce their wealth and dominance.

Maurer notes that the emergence of gold and silver as dominant currencies in the ancient world stemmed because of the fact that wealthy elites had previously acquired status objects composed of precious metals. As they consolidated their power over government and laws, they made those metals currency standards.

Bitcoin has its equivalents of those ancient elites. Big mining firms, early adopters/investors, and core developers all have an oversized interest in promoting it. The same goes for the “whales” of Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, ether and other cryptocurrencies.

This isn’t to say the crypto elites don’t deserve rewards for being early to the game or for helping to develop and secure an ingenious new form of money. Nor can one equate the power they wield – all within a system that doesn’t actively prohibit anyone from mining, owning or contributing code to bitcoin – with that of governments that use military might and judicial threats to control access to their money.

I raise it simply to point out that these influential players are both incentivized and financially enabled to aggressively push and promote their positions.

Believers gonna believe

These competing, financially enabled voices are battling for the minds of users, which means they’re appealing to people’s passions and emotions.

It’s unavoidable. You can be as nerdy and detached as the most cerebral cryptographer, but if you want your favored currency to grow to the point that it becomes money, you must engage in cultural production. You want a shared story of belonging to develop around it, one that’s widely accepted enough that your currency is widely held and used.

Of course, you also need your currency to have intrinsic qualities – those of scarcity, fungibility, transportability, durability and divisibility are common to both gold and bitcoin, for example. But in and of themselves, they aren’t sufficient. For something to become money, it needs belief.

Here we enter into the realm of myths and storytelling, the foundations upon which the most powerful systems of human organization are built – nations, religions, brands and, most of all, money.

Think of the importance attached to the unknown identity of bitcoin’s founder. It not only denied critics a target to accuse of running a get-rich-quick scheme; it gave the bitcoin community its genesis myth. That, in turn, has fed the posturing over Bitcoin Cash and Wright’s Bitcoin SV, the latter’s name alluding unabashedly to the prophet-like notion of “Satoshi’s Vision.”

But here’s the thing: “believers” are vulnerable to manipulation. (Just look at how the powerful have gotten religious communities to do their dirty work through the ages, from priests and mullahs stirring up “ethnic cleansings” to America’s televangelists fleecing their congregations.) Sadly, the increasingly wide communities interested in cryptocurrencies are similarly vulnerable – the thousands hoodwinked into BitConnect, for example.

And in a situation where specialized knowledge about the complex workings of cryptocurrency is limited, those vulnerabilities are heightened for the many who don’t fully grasp the tech.

“Because it’s supposed to be about the code and the mathematics, and not everyone understands the code and the mathematics, people take advantage of that to try to sell you whatever they want to sell,” says Maurer. “People are desperate to have a firmer foundation for their beliefs. So, it’s easier to fall for someone that offers that to them.”

I’m not saying the “trust in code” mantra isn’t useful when applied to the decentralized management of a cryptocurrency’s monetary policy or payments system. But it’s naïve to believe the human networks gathered around this technology are somehow immune to the failings of humanity itself. Worse, that belief enables the scammers.

So, if we want to rid ourselves of the Faketoshis, snake oil salesmen, and general cultural chaos of crypto, it’s up to we humans, not the code or the coders per se, to come up with ways to mitigate those failings. Human governance matters.

Alternatively, we could just leave things as they are. Sit back, grab some popcorn. Enjoy the circus.

Bitcoin’s weekly moving average convergence divergence histogram has turned bearish for the first time in seven months. Even so, sellers need to observe caution as that indicator had trapped bears on the wrong side of the market during the 2015-2017 bull run.

A bull revival, however, would be confirmed if and when prices find sustained acceptance, preferably a weekly close (Sunday, UTC), above $12,000.

Short duration charts continue to call a move lower to $9,500. The bearish case would be negated if prices invalidate the lower highs setup seen on the daily chart with a move above $10,956 (Aug 20 high on Bitstamp).

A widely-tracked trend-following bitcoin (BTC) price indicator is flashing a sell signal for the first time since February.

The weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram, which is used to identify trend reversals and trend strength, has crossed below zero and is currently printing a value of -25.13.

That is the first negative value since the first week of February. Back then, BTC was trading at $3,700. As of now, the leading cryptocurrency by market value is changing hands at $10,340 on Bitstamp, representing 2 percent gains on a 24-hour basis.

The histogram crossing below zero is considered a sign of the beginning of a new downtrend, while a move above zero is taken as confirmation of a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

MACD’s bearish crossover

Histogram’s latest drop below the zero lines indicates the rally from lows near $3,700 seen in the first week of February topped out at $13,880 in June and the bears have regained control.

Many observers consider MACD histogram as a lagging indicator. After all, it is a spread between two moving averages (MAs), which are based on past data.

Also, MACD’s bearish crossovers marked an end of corrective pullbacks during the 2015-2017 bull market, as tweeted earlier today by popular analyst Murad Mahmudov.

MACD a contrary indicator

Bitcoin bottomed out in January 2015 near $150 and rose to a record high of $20,000 in December 2017. Throughout the bull run, BTC charted bullish higher lows with histogram’s dip below zero (bearish crossover).

Put simply, MACD’s bearish turn marked an end of corrective pullbacks and what followed was rise to fresh highs.

For instance, BTC’s pullback from the November 2015 high of $502 ended near $360 with the weekly MACD falling below zero in February 2016. The cryptocurrency then picked up a strong bid in April and rose to highs near $800 by mid-June 2016.

On similar lines, BTC charted a higher low at $592 with the MACD’s bearish turn in the first week of August 2016. Further, the negative MACD bar seen in March 2017 turned out to be a bear trap.

So, the latest bearish crossover on the MACD is a strong reason for sellers to observe caution – more so, as BTC is in a long-run bull market, as stated by Mahmudov.

That said, the outlook would turn bullish if and when BTC prints a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000.

Weekly chart

BTC fell 10.49% in the second week of this month, strengthening the case for a deeper pullback put forward by the repeated failure to close above $12,000 seen in the preceding weeks.

Essentially, the rally from lows near $4,050 seen in April has stalled near $12,000 and a weekly close above that level is needed to confirm bullish revival.

Daily and 4-hour charts

Bitcoin has consistently found takers below $10,000 over the last eight weeks (above left).

However, recovery rallies from sub-$10,000 levels have been shallow, as represented by the falling trendline. That indicates a weakening of bullish momentum.

The cryptocurrency’s inability to produce a stronger bounce from the 100-day moving average (MA) support line is also a cause of worry for the bulls.

Further, the rising wedge breakdown, a bearish reversal pattern, witnessed on the 4-hour chart (above right) last week is still valid.

All-in-all, the cryptocurrency remains in the hunt for a drop to the recent low of $9,467. The bearish case would weaken if prices rise above $10,956 (Aug. 20 high), invalidating the lower highs pattern on the daily chart.

We asked legal experts in digital rights, the First Amendment and crypto to comment on the statement.

The claims are based on arguments from before the days of Bitcoin, which posit software as free speech, and thus state that it should be protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution. The topic was evidently first brought to public attention back in 1999, when digital publisher Eric Corley went to court against Universal City Studios Inc. for publishing source code that decodes DVDs.

Referring to that case in 2001, Jon O. Newman, a circuit judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, stated: “When the Framers of the First Amendment prohibited Congress from making any law ‘abridging the freedom of speech,’ they were not thinking about computers, computer programs, or the Internet.”

However, Neil Richards, one of the world's leading experts in privacy and information law, as well as freedom of expression, argued in 2016 that: “Code = Speech is a fallacy because it would needlessly treat writing the code for a malicious virus as equivalent to writing an editorial in the New York Times,” adding that it is simply wrong.

Could the U.S.'s First Amendment regulate the legality of Bitcoin as free speech?

Lata Nott, Executive director, First Amendment Center Freedom Forum Institute Although some courts have recognized code as speech, the Supreme Court hasn't weighed in on this, so I wouldn't call this a settled area of law. Personally, I think that code can be used to express and communicate ideas, and therefore can be viewed as a form of speech. But whether that speech is protected by the First Amendment is a different question. Not every type of speech is. For example, if you threaten someone's life, or hire a hitman, you are certainly engaging in the act of speech, but the First Amendment won't protect it. There are times when speech becomes conduct — when it's more than just an expression of an idea, but constitutes an action — and that's usually when the government can regulate it. Using code to create a video game could be considered an act of expression protected by the First Amendment. Using code to launch denial of service attacks probably wouldn't be. Using the blockchain to donate money to a political cause could be protected by the First Amendment, but using it to implement a smart contract might not be.

Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University Is Bitcoin “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment? Probably not in the way that some appear to be arguing. The argument is that because code is speech, and because Bitcoin is code, Bitcoin is speech. The problem with this argument is that code is only sometimes protected from regulation as free speech — namely, when the regulation affects the use of code as a form of expression. But code generally isn’t protected from regulation that targets its use as a machine. For example, Congress generally cannot prevent computer scientists from exchanging code to express their algorithmic ideas, but Congress can regulate the maximum speed of cars even if doing so requires carmakers to change the code used to set that speed. Bitcoin is made up of ones and zeros, but those bits generally are not expressive, except in the way that normal currency is. For that reason, Congress very likely can regulate Bitcoin in the way it regulates any other currency — by imposing financial regulations and the like — so long as it does not violate the protections recognized for political contributions and expenditures. In short, the fact that Bitcoin is made up of ones and zeros does not on its own imbue it with the expressive character necessary for it to be protected as free speech.

Sheila Warren, portfolio head, blockchain and distributed ledger technology, World Economic Forum Leaving IP protections for code and their First Amendment implications aside, the really fascinating question is whether anonymous payments should be protected under free speech doctrine. There’s a pretty robust history in the United States of prosecuting payments systems, going back in recent times to the hawala prosecutions after the Patriot Act was passed and on to Liberty Reserve. In a post-Citizens United world, however, we’ve pretty much decided (or, SCOTUS has decided) that money is essential to speech. And there’s no question that the giving of money is a critical element of political participation, as established in 1976 in Buckley v. Valeo. But do we really want a society where we sanction the even more anonymous funding of politics?

Robert Corn-Revere, partner at Davis Wright Tremaine, LLP The syllogism is tempting: code is speech; speech is protected by the U.S. Constitution; therefore, blockchain is protected by the First Amendment. But so far there is no clear answer for how far U.S. courts will go in accepting this logic. This is because it ties into a longstanding debate over First Amendment protection for speech versus action, and this can get complicated when the two overlap in the form of “communicative conduct” (such as burning a draft card or a flag in protest). The more code is deemed “functional,” the more those seeking to regulate it will argue it falls on the “conduct” side of the line. The first cases to test the “code as speech” theory had to do with cryptographic source code, the function of which is to enable confidential or anonymous speech — which itself is something the First Amendment protects. It remains to be seen whether courts will accept the same argument for cryptocurrency.

Vinny Lingham, CEO and co-founder of Civic With a history tied to Silk Road and countless cryptocurrencies that are struggling with adoption and volatility, blockchain technology faces challenges of interoperability, scaling, perception and use cases. There’s also an underlying issue with data privacy — we don’t know who we’re interacting with online. When there is an inability to prove who you are, it creates a ripple effect, leaving a wake of disinformation and distrust. Our digital, modern world has brought these trust gaps to light. Raised in South Africa during apartheid, I was born without voting rights. So, election fairness hits close to home for me, especially linked to identity. To unshackle ourselves from old systems based on disinformation, we must foster transparency and trust, and that evolves from allowing people to better control their personal data, through digital identities and zero knowledge proofs. This is also good for business. Not only does protecting data privacy help reduce fraud, it also cultivates brand trust. I’m a firm supporter of First Amendment rights, and I also believe we, as technologists, should be putting our efforts into creating solutions that enable trust and can withstand the test of time.

Carol Goforth, Clayton N. Little professor of law at the University of Arkansas, former Arkansas Bar Foundation professor of law While I am not a constitutional law scholar, it is my opinion that there is merit to the statement, although it probably does not mean what the author hopes. Commercial speech is absolutely protected under the First Amendment, and I am happy to assume that code being put out by crypto developers and entrepreneurs could fit within the scope of that rule. However, this does not mean that there is an absolute right to release and discuss such code free of regulation. In very general terms, commercial speech that is false, misleading, or relates to illegal activity (such as money laundering, or the funding of criminal enterprises, or with the purpose of defrauding potential purchasers), is not really protected by the First Amendment because there is no legitimate interest in providing listeners with that kind of information. Thus, when an agency (like FinCEN or the SEC) imposes regulations and requirements relative to that coding and statements concerning it, they are likely to be advancing a significant public interest and not infringing on First Amendment rights. First Amendment protection has never been a guarantee that you can say anything you want, at any time, without consequences.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/not-an-audit-irs-notice-could-spell-trouble-for-crypto-traders/,"'Not an Audit': IRS Notice Could Spell Trouble for Crypto Traders

The IRS took to Twitter on August, 26, posting a video about recently mailed CP2000 notices, of special interest to crypto traders. The notice, which seeks to rectify discrepancies made by recipients in tax reporting, is another in a series of crypto-related letters recently sent by the agency. Though the promised guidelines for reporting still haven’t been delivered, crypto holders are nonetheless expected to magically know how to file. Some might even be surprised to learn that exchanges are sharing their financial info with the agency.

It’s Not an Audit, It Just Works Like One

The CP2000 notice is not strictly a crypto-related notice like notices 6173, 6174 or 6174-A, but because of the large role exchanges now play in cryptocurrency trading, and the information they release to the IRS, some taxpayers will have reported earnings that do not match the records of the exchanges they utilize. With previously promised guidelines still not issued, the likelihood of discrepancy is arguably large. These letters are not just friendly reminders, either, but come with real threats of severe punitive action. According to hrblock.com:

CP2000 notices aren’t audits, but they work the same. It’s important to fully respond by the IRS deadline.

Many exchange users might be wondering how or from where the IRS got their tax info. It’s worth noting that U.S. law requires all broker and barter exchange services to report individually — via a 1099-B — for “each person” for whom they facilitated trading of “property or services.” What’s more, the CP2000 notices aren’t even created by humans. They’re computer generated, and according to H&R Block, “may not be right.” The tax assistance site goes on to detail: “You might not owe the full amount – or anything at all. In fact, many taxpayers who get a CP2000 notice don’t end up owing anything.”

The IRS’ Sweet Youtube Vid

Posted to the @IRSnews Twitter account on Monday, the linked video features an agency spokesperson (with all the calm, measured contempt of a robot) assuring viewers that the letters are not audits, but that:

They have 30 days to respond

They can contest the proposed adjustment, but must respond either way

If no solution can be agreed upon, the discrepancy can be contested in court

The spokesperson goes on to clarify that:

If we’re not able to accept your explanation … we’ll send you a CP3219A, which is a statutory notice of deficiency.

The CP3219A is basically an escalation of CP2000, which in order to be contested, obliges the recipient to file a petition with the U.S. Tax Court.

The Source of Confusion

Nobody knows exactly how, why, when, or where the IRS will choose to treat cryptocurrencies as securities, convertible virtual currencies, property, or otherwise, and in what combination. Technically, cryptos are “property” in the U.S., as per the last issued guidance in 2014, and taxes apply to property exchange. Some crypto tax accountants advise using like-kind reporting for this reason, to avoid unnecessary payments.

Tax experts have since confirmed that purchasing anything with crypto constitutes a taxable event, and the IRS seems to agree, judging by the new crypto-specific letters they’ve been issuing which state: “We have information that … you may not have met your U.S. tax filing and reporting requirements for transactions involving virtual currency.” This means that trading cryptos is a taxable event as well.

The IRS further requires third-party network and payment card transactions be reported via form 1099-K. Exchanges usually provide these forms to their high volume users to help them calculate capital gains, but which exchanges — outside of Coinbase — might also provide personal user information to the IRS, and how they do so, remains unclear.

Accountants Step Up

Helping confused people file crypto taxes is becoming big business. Especially since so few CPAs actually know how to do it. This is no surprise, as there is not a set procedure issued by the IRS in the first place. There are a few businesses and pioneering minds out there who are stepping up to the plate, however, in the midst of the unsettling ambiguity.

Enrolled Agent Clinton Donnelly of donnellytaxlaw.com recently shared his recommendation for filing safely, telling news.Bitcoin.com that “A great crypto tax return in the U.S. reports both the AML [Anti-Money Laundering] form and the crypto income.” The form being referred to here is 8300. Donnelly went on to clarify that if crypto traders have forgotten to file this form, they can follow a tax amnesty procedure to avoid $10,000+ fines. It’s important to remember, though, that while tax guidance can be a huge help, especially for big time traders, even the new experts don’t always agree. Once again, the non-existence of clear IRS guidance creates the trouble. In the case of new tax services, it has also created real market demand.

A Taxingly Tedious Situation

Ignoring the fact that taxation is a legalized form of stealing (legalized extortion), for those who still wish — for the preservation of their own safety and livelihood, or voluntarily — to comply, things are still not easy. With any number of forms being potentially required, AI databases examining exchange info against personal filings, and a complete lack of clear guidance from the agency demanding the money in the first place, the whole thing reads as darkly comical, bordering on the absurd.

Leave it to the IRS, the sentiment goes, to take a perfectly simple concept like P2P, permissionless exchange, and turn it into the head scratcher of a hot mess it is today, when viewed as a taxable event. It’s fairly certain a small child could devise a better plan, but then again, what would the IRS do without their jobs? There aren’t many openings in the private sector for someone to sit around all day threatening the more productive members of society.

The company said in an announcement on Monday that Binance Lending will be available for customer subscription starting from 6:00 UTC on Aug. 28, on a first-come, first-served basis.

Initially, users will be able to lend their U.S. dollar-pegged USDT, ethereum classic (ETC) and Binance’s BNB cryptocurrency in order to earn interest, payable from Aug. 29 to Sept. 11.

The annualized interest rate for the initial lending products with a 14-day fixed maturity term, has been set at 15 percent, 10 percent and seven percent, for BNB, USDT, and ETC, respectively.

Binance puts out a total subscription cap of 200,000 BNB, 5 million USDT and 20,000 ETC. If all the initially planned products get fully subscribed, Binance would pay out interests of 1,150 BNB, 19,178 USDT and 53 ETC, which worth about $50,000 as of press time.

Each user’s account on Binance will have an initial hard cap for BNB-, USDT- and ETC-denominated lending products at 500 BNB, 1,000,000 USDT, and 1,000 ETC, respectively.

In the meantime, Binance’s recently-launched margin trading business charges users who borrow BNB and USDT an annualized interest of as much as 109 percent and 10.0375 percent, respectively.

And just hours before the lending business announcement, Binance said on its website that starting from Aug. 27, it will increase the annualized margin borrow interest rate for ETC from previously 7.3 percent to 14.6 percent.

The company said it will be “constantly evaluating new coins and tokens to support as lending products based on demand” and new products will be revealed weekly on Monday and become available for subscription on Wednesday.

The plan may not be entirely surprising to some given CZ mentioned during a recent London event that the firm was planning to launch a lending business around mid August.

The launch is another move of Binance in its bid to diversify its business lines to attract and retain users weeks after it formally rolled out margin trading and borrowing in July and revealed plans to add futures trading on its platform.

Today on August 26, digital currency markets have gained around 1.52%, gathering $4 billion since the initial slump. Despite the volatility, cryptocurrencies have consolidated and a few speculators believe a breakout is on the cards that could send prices sky-high or plunge below the current support.

Top Crypto Coins Slowly Move Northbound

On Sunday, August 25, the price of bitcoin core (BTC) gathered steam again after tumbling below the $10K zone. During the late evening trading sessions, BTC prices vaulted upwards $500 in a matter of minutes and many other markets also saw gains. Currently, the price of BTC is hovering around $10,342 per coin and there’s more than $17 billion worth of trade volume today. BTC’s market cap is $185 billion this Monday, which is 69% of the $267 billion dollar market cap of all 2,000+ coins.

BTC/USD markets are up 2.27% today but are down 3.4% for the week. Following BTC is ethereum (ETH), which is up 0.5% today and down 5.3% over the last seven days. ETH is trading for $189 a coin and has an overall market valuation of about $20.4 billion. Ripple (XRP) is selling for $0.27 and prices have dipped in value over 3.8% in the last week. The fifth largest market valuation is held by litecoin (LTC) which is swapping for $74. LTC lost 3.9% last week but over the last 24 hours, LTC is up 1.61%.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

Bitcoin cash (BCH) markets have been holding steady and at press time one BCH is swapping for $309. BCH/USD is up 1.31% today but lost 4% over the course of the week. On Monday, August 26, BCH is the sixth most traded coin below EOS and above XRP with $1.37 billion in trade volume. USDT is the strongest pair trading against BCH with 56% of all global trades. This is followed by swaps with BTC (26%), USD (7.7%), ETH (6.4%), KRW (1.9%), and EUR (0.43%). The exchanges swapping the most bitcoin cash include Coinbene ($182M), Hitbtc ($70M), Okex ($50.4M), Digifinex ($46.6M), and Bibox ($38M). Bitcoin cash transactions in the last 24 hours were around 39,310 with a daily average this week just above 40K.

With a Possible Economic Crisis on the Horizon, Will BTC Act as a Safe Haven Asset Like Gold?

As the global economy shudders and prepares to embrace a looming recession, precious metal markets have rocketed while cryptocurrencies have seen lighter inflow. Some digital currency influencers are not so sure BTC is a safe haven asset right now. Speaking in an interview on the financial newswire Bloomberg, Spencer Bogart, a Blockchain Capital executive, is not quite convinced that an economic crisis is on the horizon. “When you think about really severe crises taking place, a liquidity crunch, another global financial crisis, I think that bitcoin will struggle to do very well from a price perspective,” Bogart explained. Despite the possible struggle, Bogart thinks in the “longer term bitcoin will absolutely be a safe haven.”

In another interview on Nasdaq Trade talks, Nelson Minier, Kraken’s over-the-counter (OTC) lead executive, shared similar opinions. “I’m not so sure that it’s a safe haven asset yet, but I do think that it’s starting to act like one. I think that people are starting to portfolio manage, are starting to come in slowly. And when the market is getting shaky you saw Bitcoin rise, I mean, you wouldn’t see that before, it was trading like a risky asset,” Minier said. Just like Bogart, however, Minier remarked that BTC will likely fall into that category, stating “we’re heading that way for sure.”

BTC Price Reacts in Real-Time to Trump Trade War Tweets

On August 23, U.S. President Donald Trump told the American public that the trade war between the U.S. and China would continue to escalate. Immediately after the Trump tweets the price of BTC/USD spiked and well-known macro trader Alex Krüger noticed a chart milestone. “Today was the first time BTC reacted sharply in *real-time* to a Trade War breaking headline or USD/CNY fix,” Krüger tweeted. “As far as I can recall, this, in fact, is the first time BTC reacts in real-time to any event outside of crypto,” the trader added.

…Additionally, the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, that was being taxed from September 1st at 10%, will now be taxed at 15%. Thank you for your attention to this matter! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019

Similarly to gold, some speculators believe digital currencies can act as a safe haven asset in order to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. The tensions between the U.S. and China also made the price of gold jump more than 2.4% and the price per ounce of gold (Au) right now is $1,530.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Markets Still Indicate an Upward Trend

According to cryptocurrency price analysts, bitcoin cash (BCH) looks poised to break out northbound. The trader Mehak Punjabi explained on August 26 that the price of BCH may continue to rise higher and could target a price of around $330 per coin. “By comparing the price of BCH coin from its lowest value which was $283.29 on 15-Aug-19 at 05:00 UTC and the current trading price, BCH indicates a bullish trend by 10%,” Punjabi said. “The CMF indicator also reflects that the bitcoin cash price is indicating an upward trend. The 7-day high price of the coin $326.88 points the next target of BCH towards $330.” The analyst added:

Trading in the BCH for a long term will yield great returns and dividends.

Crypto Markets May Experience Extreme Economic Fallout for the First Time

Overall, most crypto supporters are still positive about the long term game but are still uncertain about the current period and whether digital currency markets will remain vibrant during a deep economic recession. Currently, the economies in Latin America are floundering and many countries in South America are dealing with severe inflation compared with the rest of the world. Economic growth in India is falling below average and the country’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has plans to focus on priming lending and foreign funding. Moreover, Time reports that 34% of U.S.-based business economists are concerned that the U.S. will see a deep economic recession within the next two years. Most of the economists who participated in the National Association for Business Economics survey believe that America will see the economy tumble hard by the end of 2021.

With the macroeconomic uncertainty in the air and signs of distress, it is still hard to picture what crypto markets will do during an economic fallout. Bitcoin itself was born from the ashes of the 2008 economic crisis and has yet to experience a global recession of that magnitude. For now, with all the ‘doom and gloom’ happening worldwide, seeing a macro hedge spur from gold markets is normal. Despite over-exuberant optimism, no one really knows if cryptocurrencies such as BTC will act in the same manner if the global economy worsens. For now, it’s a case of wait and see.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — of Facebook founding fame — told CNN Wall Street is ""asleep at the wheel"" regarding cryptocurrency.

When asked about governments' fears around digital coins like Facebook's upcoming Libra currency, Tyler said the concerns aren't ""a unique problem to bitcoin or crypto.""

The twins launched the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange in 2015 with the goal of bringing regulation to the volatile assets.

Tyler Winklevoss told Business Insider in April he hopes Gemini can serve as an ""on-ramp"" for institutional investors and banks to start using digital currencies.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — who rose to fame with Facebook's founding — told CNN Wall Street is underestimating the potential of cryptocurrency.

The two warned institutional investors are overlooking bitcoin and similar assets. The two noted that cryptocurrency retail investors have profited off recent gains while Wall Street misses out.

""It's been a retail-driven market, from day one. It still is, and a lot of people have done really well,"" Tyler Winklevoss said. ""Wall Street's asleep at the wheel.""

The twins have a history with endorsing the controversial asset class. Tyler said the two ""believe in the long game"" with bitcoin in a January Reddit comment, adding they ""are committed as ever"" to making a bitcoin exchange-traded-fund. The two even claimed in 2013 to own at least 1% of all bitcoin in existence.

""We had to invest because we were afraid of missing out. We couldn't miss out on this future,"" Cameron Winklevoss told CNN.

The two also addressed fears from government officials around Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency and bitcoin's use in illegal purchases. The concerns aren't ""a unique problem to bitcoin or crypto,"" Tyler said, and are seen with fiat currencies just as often.

""Smart criminals haven't been using bitcoin because its actually very traceable,"" he said.

The Winklevosses announced their Gemini cryptocurrency exchange project in January 2015 with the goal of bringing regulation to the relatively lawless asset. The exchange established its own cryptocurrency — a stable coin pegged to the US dollar — and a mobile crypto-trading app in 2018.

The two explained in April they want to bring digital currencies to mainstream financial institutions, and that increased regulation is necessary for such an endeavor.

Though bitcoin remains well under its December 2017 peak of about 19,000 per coin, the digital asset has surged in recent months. Bitcoin traded at $10,322.79 per coin as of 1:25 p.m. ET Monday, up about 177% year-to-date.

Transacting, however, comprises a small share of the cryptocurrency’s use cases, he explains.

Bitcoin usage: 90% digital gold, 10% digital cash

Swanepoel said during an interview with CNBC published on Aug. 26, that only a small portion of its users buy Bitcoin only then to use it for transactions. Meanwhile, nearly all are either investors or speculators. He explained:

“Roughly about 90% I would put into the category of investments slash speculations, so it could be people who have a long term view on it, people who like to trade it and about 10% would be transactions.”

Portfolio managers should have some exposure

Swanepoel also suggests that — when managing investment portfolios — “it does make sense to put a tiny little bit of money into cryptocurrency.” The reason he provided is that, while risk is high, the potential returns are astronomical.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, head of over-the-counter sales at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken Nelson Minier has compared today’s cryptocurrency trading industry to his early days of Wall Street — adding that it is still too soon to call Bitcoin a safe haven for investors.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin is increasingly being mentioned alongside traditional safe haven assets, as Cointelegraph recently reported. With recent data showing that Bitcoin is the least correlated with traditional markets, investors are increasingly considering Bitcoin as a hedge, particularly as central banks around the globe are showing no signs of stopping their policy of monetary easing.

The Swiss financial regulator has awarded banking and securities dealer licences to two new “crypto banks”. SEBA and Sygnum have been cleared to operate in the new world of tokenised digital securities, a major milestone for the fledging industry.

At the same time, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) issued rules on how to apply anti-money laundering regulations to the banks “where the inherent anonymity of blockchain technology presents increased risks”.

This restricts the transfer of tokens to people the bank knows. “FINMA-supervised institutions are thus not permitted to receive tokens from customers of other institutions or to send tokens to such customers. This practice applies as long as information about the sender and recipient cannot be transmitted reliably in the respective payment system.”

Zug-based SEBA says it will be operational in October once it fulfils “secondary criteria” demanded by FINMA. It plans to offer corporate and asset management services for the new asset class.

Sygnum, headquartered in Zurich, has teamed up with the German stock exchange, telecoms operator Swisscom and other partners to list and trade tokenised securities on a distributed ledger technology platform.

“Being awarded the banking and securities dealer licence from FINMA is a significant milestone, and an important step towards the institutionalisation of the digital asset economy”, said Manuel Krieger, co-founder and CEO of Sygnum Switzerland.

Sygnum also has also been awarded its Swiss licenses on a conditional basis until it meets ""secondary requirements"" demanded by FINMA. It has also applied for a capital markets services licence in Singapore.

The Swiss financial centre has for the last couple of years been gearing up to provide a blockchain-based infrastructure to trade the new digital assets. The Swiss stock exchange operator SIX plans to launch a new platform next year while several start-ups have also sprung up in Switzerland.



Some, such as Bitcoin Suisse, Crypto Finance and Lykke have also applied for licenses from FINMA.

The client application is offering a giveaway 6.6 testnet GRAM tokens — the native currency of Telegram’s TON blockchain platform — for users that activate its wallet, Forbes reported on Aug. 26.

Onboarding a TON of people

Alex Safonov — Button Wallet’s co-founder and CEO — has said the GRAM token giveaway aims to encourage adoption by giving users the practical experience of transacting digital assets without risk. He said:

""Cryptos' biggest obstacle is mass adoption and what we’ve created will help people comfortable with trading cryptocurrency without using real money.""

Safonov alluded to the “fanfare surrounding Facebook’s libra digital currency” — a crypto payments network that the social media titan plans to integrate into apps such as Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.

Notwithstanding this overheated anticipation, he went on to imply that without the concrete experience of using cryptocurrency transaction services, adoption continues to lag behind.

Button Wallet’s chief operations officer Rachel McCrary likewise claimed that “there’s common fear around crypto which is preventing some people from becoming new users.”

Security wobbles

As Forbes notes, just as Button Wallet launches its third-party testing wallet services on the encrypted messaging app, reports have surfaced that a technical bug is causing Telegram’s group messaging chats to be leaked.

Anxiety around the apparent bug has beset pro-democracy activists and Telegram users in Hong Kong, who reportedly fear that the issue could expose them to the Chinese authorities.

Controversial bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow described Ethereum as “a technological dead-end” after the digital ledger project ran out of capacity.

Ethereum Struggles With Congestion Again

The network utilization of Ether, Ethereum’s native asset, soared above 90 percent, according to data provided by Etherscan.io. The surge, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, could prompt transactions costs to increase, making it expensive for corporate users. The comments indirectly referred to Tether Limited, a Hong Kong-incorporated firm that issues its stablecoins atop the Ethereum blockchain.

The past month saw Tether paying $26,000 in fees to miners whose machines process transactions on Ethereum’s ledger. Data researcher Ethgasstation noted that the Hong Kong firm ended up jamming the network, a reminiscent of how CryptoKitties – an app launched on the Ethereum’s blockchain – did the same back in 2017. Only this time, Tether’s impact on the blockchain was 17.5 times higher than that of CryptoKitties.

Mowing-Mowing

Mow, who has been an adamant critic of Ethereum, took to his Twitter profile to reiterate his distaste of the world’s second-largest blockchain project. Saying it is a dead-end technologically, Mow forecasted that Ethereum would die one day because of its own growth. Excerpts:

Ethereum is a technological dead end. The more it’s used, the faster it dies. Fortunately, USDT is also available on the #LiquidNetwork which is more scalable and later will allow Lightning Networks to be created for assets like Tether.

The latest comments made to Mow’s extended record of Ethereum-shaming. As a chief strategy officer of Blockstream, he has called the Buterin’s blockchain project with a string of demeaning names, including “the most impractical thing in existence,” a “science fair project,” and “centralized AF.”

Personally I don't think Ethereum is a competitor. It's a science fair project. Cool concept. Little real world use. https://t.co/cJ7OYP3EV6 — Samson Mow (@Excellion) June 19, 2016

The blockchain bigwig also said that he wishes “ill on Ethereum,” which has “no future.”

Meanwhile, the #2 cryptocurrency is taking steps towards improving its network capacity issues. The blockchain, which currently relies on a proof-of-work mechanism, is looking to switch to more basic approaches known as staking and sharding, which will reduce the network’s burden.

Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a Los Angeles-based asset manager, nevertheless believes that Ethereum still cannot guarantee that its scalability solutions would eventually work. It is, therefore, prompting developers to take their projects on other blockchains.

So the biggest implication today is simply that developers may be incentivized to wait until this transition happens before fully committing to building on Ethereum,” Dorman told Bloomberg. “Tether isn’t helping.

The Boos, Meanwhile

Mow’s latest criticism for Ethereum, meanwhile, has attracted further criticism from the community. People have questioned the blockchain strategist about his allegiance to an ETH-backed startup called INX Limited, for which he allegedly took 100,000 ERC20 tokens as an advisory fee.

Wait, I'm confused, why would you advise inx who is building on eth, if you are being honest about your opinion? Why is inx not on liquid? — The Crypto Lark (@TheCryptoLark) August 27, 2019

Not a week goes by without the world’s most dominant crypto exchange launching a new service or incentive. This week has been no different with the announcement of a controversial crypto lending platform. Reaction has been mixed and not all think it is the best thing for the crypto ecosystem.

In its latest move to cement a growing monopoly in the crypto services industry, Binance announced a lending platform which will launch on August 29. The service will allow users to lend out their holdings for fixed periods of time, initially 14 days, and gain a passive income from the interest. It also added that there will be annualized interest rates for certain crypto assets – with its own native token, BNB, unsurprisingly offering the highest interest rate.

Offering Fixed Interest Rates is Unwise

The crypto community has already reacted to the latest attempt from CZ et al to dominate the industry by hovering up as many customers as it can. Offering fixed interest rates is not so commonplace in the financial industry and could cause problems down the road, especially when one of the proposed interest payment options is in Tether (USDT).

Research director Larry Cermak tweeted exactly that, stating that offering guaranteed rates of return is never a good idea. There were further comparisons of the proposed platform to the Bitconnect lending scam which folded in January 2018. Some of the responses to the announcement were quite vociferous.

“I did not know that @cz_binance is so desperate to try to make us keep his coin … once binance is out from us #BNB will crash so hard that ppl will start starving and they will also ruin his family i think is time to create a blog about all this ponzy scams!”

While it is highly unlikely that Binance is in fact a scam, the new lending scheme does appear to be just another attempt by the company to get people to hodl Binance Coin.

Forget About Basic Crypto Security

Another aspect not overlooked by astute industry observers is the encouragement to keep funds locked up on a centralized exchange that has already suffered a hack this year. Granted, Binance has its SAFU for insurance against such things, but in reality it is just one big digital bank holding all of the keys. And as the old crypto adage goes, ‘Not your keys, not your coins’.

Binance also has ambitions to be the provider of the world’s stablecoins, all built on its own blockchain and protocol of course, to take on Facebook’s Libra. The company seems to have no inhibitions at the moment and is on track to becoming the totally dominant ‘Google of the crypto world’.

In order for cryptocurrencies to fulfill their intended destinies as decentralized money, they need to be released from controlling elements such as centralized exchanges, companies, tokens and lending schemes. Binance’s lending scheme goes completely against the basic rules of crypto security and adds another element of third-party control over user’s funds.

Primary use for privacy reasons

According to a recent Chainalysis webinar, the majority of funds sent to cryptocurrency mixing services or tumblers comes from exchanges, which indicates that such funds are primarily used for privacy purposes rather than for illicit activities.

Conducted on Aug. 14, the webinar called “Cryptocurrency Typologies: What You Should Know About Who’s Who on the Blockchains” covers a large number of risk typologies in crypto industry, including darknet markets, terrorist financing, sanctioned cryptocurrency addresses, stolen funds, scams and others.

Still the main destination for stolen crypto

In the webinar presentation, Chainalysis described a crypto mixer as websites or software for obfuscating the source of funds, which does not require any Know Your Customer procedures, exists both on clearnet and darknet and is typically centrally controlled.

Identifying mixers as a high risk typology, Chainalysis claims that as much as 40% of all funds on crypto tumblers originates from crypto exchanges, while only 2.7% is sent from darknet market.

A significant fraction of funds on crypto mixers is represented by those that come from other mixing services, which is purportedly believed by people to add an extra layer of obfuscation, Chainalysis’ senior product manager of data Hanna Curtis explained.

While stolen coins represent roughly 8% of funds going through crypto mixers, these anonymizing services are still the primary destination of cryptocurrencies after they get stolen, Curtis stated.

Additionally, Chainalysis noted a surging popularity of decentralized mixer protocols as opposed to centralized ones due to the existing vulnerability to law enforcement authorities.

According to the firm, Wasabi Wallet has mixed a total of $250 million in Bitcoin (BTC) so far in 2019, seeing a significant rise in volume since January.

In comparison, major centralized crypto tumbler Bestmixer, which was shut down by Europol in May 2019, mixed $200 million over a twelve-month period, according to Chainalysis.

Recently, Luxembourg-based crypto capital flow firm Clain published a research claiming that at least 4,836 Bitcoin of stolen from Binance exchange in May 2019 was laundered through crypto mixing service Chipmixer.",,https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-erik-finman-bitcoin-investor-millionaire-2019-8,"Finman first learned about bitcoin from a ""hippie"" at a protest, and he thought it sounded promising.

In an interview with Cheddar, Finman shared the origin story of his discovery of bitcoin:

Finman said his older brother brought him to a protest following the financial crisis of 2008. He recalls running from the police and seeing a man wearing a bitcoin shirt, and then asking him what bitcoin was.

""He's like a hippie, he's like, 'Man, I think it's gonna end Wall Street, all the corruption, and all the bad things.'""

That prompted Finman to research the cryptocurrency himself and he decided, along with his brother, that it was the next big thing.

Single Sign-On",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chainalysis-executive-transparency-and-analytics-build-trust-in-crypto,"Jesse Spiro, global head of policy at blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, has said that he believes that transparency builds trust in crypto.

Speaking with Cointelegraph, Spiro addressed widespread concerns that blockchain analytics negatively affect Bitcoin’s (BTC) fungibility and explained why he believes that transparency builds trust in crypto. When he was asked what he believes would be the impact of blacklisting Bitcoin addresses on the coin’s price, he explained:

“Active financial integrity in the ecosystem could also help counter that concern that crypto is a wild west with no way of telling if you’re dealing with someone profiting off of child exploitation. In that sense, transparency and an ability to assess the activity at play, can help build trust in cryptocurrency, which is a significant part of the Chainalysis mission.”

Blacklisting doesn’t affect fungibility

Spiro also explained that he is not of the mind that blocking addresses and marking Bitcoin involved in illegal activity decreases overall value and fungibility. For instance, he explained that in the case of sanctions “BTC would be explicitly untainted by the public removal of sanctions.” Spiro also said:

“Overall, whether frozen or merely identified with problematic activity but still in circulation, the issue is less about fungibility, and more about reasonableness in how far from and what the connection to criminal activity it’s a risk to be transacting (indirect exposure etc), like with fiat (digital or not) today.”

This, according to Spiro, is why blockchain analytics are needed for institutions like cryptocurrency exchanges.

As Cointelegraph reported, Chainalysis recently launched alerts for suspicious transactions across 15 major cryptocurrencies.

In this latest example, a $120 million buy wall was spotted by multiple crypto analysts overnight and into the early morning hours on leverage trading platform BitMEX. But who set the order, and what was the intent behind it?

The Curious Case of the Bewildering BitMEX Bitcoin Buy Wall

Last night, a massive buy order for Bitcoin on BitMEX appeared at $10,150 and then again later at $10,120 and sat there over the course of a few hours, pushing Bitcoin price up incrementally. Buy orders of this magnitude are rare, and when left in a large single order block, are called “buy walls.”

Buy walls can simply be large orders by large players just waiting to be filled. Wealthy investors use large amounts of capital, and could very well have an order set that’s far more than what is currently being sold on a platform.

Other times and the more likely scenario is that the buy wall was part of an elaborate strategy, or was simple spoofing – the practice of setting large orders in an attempt to encourage buying or selling, depending on if the “spoof” is a buy order or a sell order.

A few hours ago, there was a $120M buy wall on Bitmex.

Don't get caught with your pants down. — The Crypto Monk ⛩ (@thecryptomonk) August 28, 2019

Large buy orders like this one give crypto traders false confidence that support or buying interest below exists, and can artificially drive up the price of an asset. The inverse is true for sell walls.

Other theories include the buy wall being used to actually unload Bitcoin. One crypto analyst says that the order could have been set so the person behind the order could actually “unload” their Bitcoin. The analyst says that the buy wall was the only way the price could be sustained while the same person was dumping their Bitcoin at slightly higher prices.

Open Interest Increasing, Is a Big Move Coming?

The buy wall has also had a spillover effect of renewing interest in crypto traders, as open interest has increased on BitMEX by about 11,000 BTC, or by roughly $112 million.

https://twitter.com/macnbtc/status/1166668208805482497?s=12

Open interest increasing typically precedes a big move, and given how long Bitcoin has been trading sideways, the largest move in some time is expected. One crypto analyst suggests that the “next move is going to be something else.”

Backers of other cryptocurrencies are now fighting to ensure the fusillade doesn’t take them down, too.

Crypto lobbyists are trying to convince lawmakers that efforts to slow or stop Facebook’s virtual coin shouldn’t apply to bitcoin and other older digital currencies. The lobbying is expected to take on new urgency during the coming weeks as lawmakers return from recess and renew efforts to define and rein in Libra.

“What we don’t want to happen is members of Congress for the first time come in and author legislation that aims to go after Facebook and inadvertently takes out the other part of the industry,” said Kristin Smith, director of the Blockchain Assn., a trade group that represents several large cryptocurrency companies, including some also involved in Libra.

Facebook’s June announcement that it’s trying to create a new cryptocurrency to make online payments cheaper and easier met with swift pushback in Washington. Though the project is a joint effort with Visa Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and 25 other partners — and Facebook emphasized it had no more power over the project than the others — its prominent role drew criticism from policymakers who were already concerned about the social network’s issues with privacy and market power.

President Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have all questioned Libra. Trump said in a series of posts on Twitter in July that Libra “will have little standing or dependability” and that he is “not a fan” of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission are also paying close attention to Libra and could choose to define it as a security — a potential death knell for the project. Defenders of other cryptocurrencies want to avoid a similar fate.

Some critics of Libra have said its planned structure as a coin backed by multiple currencies and short-term government debt looks similar to that of exchange-traded funds, which typically receive SEC oversight. Although not commenting on Libra directly, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said that if something looks and operates like an exchange-traded fund, it should be regulated like an exchange-traded fund. That could potentially cripple Libra as a digital currency by creating onerous reporting rules and requirements for protecting investors.

In the last two months, at least four new firms have registered to lobby for Facebook on cryptocurrencies and related issues. The latest registrant was John Collins of FS Vector, a lobbying and regulatory compliance firm in Washington. He’s a former executive with the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Inc.

U.S. lawmakers are planning legislation that would make it difficult, if not impossible, for Libra to launch. Intentionally or not, that could affect other cryptocurrency projects.

The outcome could be critical for bitcoin, ether and scores of other cryptocurrencies that the market values in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Some bitcoin advocates believe Libra could make Facebook’s more than 2 billion users more comfortable with digital currencies overall. But Facebook’s privacy and data breaches are also drawing unwelcome links.

At House and Senate committee hearings in July, lawmakers blasted Facebook executive and Libra co-creator David Marcus, criticizing the project’s initial white paper for being light on details. The lawmakers also linked Libra to other Facebook missteps from the past several years.

To distance bitcoin from Libra, the Blockchain Assn.’s Smith said the trade group met with the offices of 60 lawmakers during the two weeks before the hearings. The meetings included the staffs of most of the Senate Banking and House Financial Services committee members.

The Libra Assn., a Geneva, Switzerland-based nonprofit that is to govern the proposed cryptocurrency, has plowed ahead since the hearings even though the blowback rattled some participants, people close to the project said. Members have formed working groups to address various aspects of the project, such as privacy and governance, the people said. And engineers have submitted and reviewed more than 400 revisions to Libra’s open-source code since the week of July 14, when Marcus testified at the hearings.

Dante Disparte, the Libra Assn.’s head of policy and communications, said in a statement that the group believes “financial inclusion, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection are not competing objectives, but rather work in lockstep” with the goal of offering a simpler global currency to billions of people.

Lawmakers are plotting a response. Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) may offer legislation that would have the effect of making currencies such as Libra illegal, according to a draft of the bill reviewed by Bloomberg. The legislation would amend a U.S. statute originally meant to prevent Americans from minting their own physical currencies. The amendment would also make it illegal for someone to create a digital currency, intended to be used as money, whose value is based on assets held in reserve.

House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) has circulated proposed legislation that would forbid large technology platforms such as Facebook from launching cryptocurrencies. Waters said Friday that one of her committee’s priorities in the coming months will be “conducting an ongoing review” of Libra.

Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), the head of the Senate Banking Committee, has also expressed interest in more comprehensive legislation. Few policy analysts, however, expect Congress to pass major legislation before the 2020 U.S. elections.

Supporters of digital currency worry that some of the proposed legislative measures would quash more digital currencies than just Libra. Bitcoin, its backers argue, is less a currency than a store of value because its price can move up or down. But so-called stable coins, such as USD coin and tether, have a fixed price and could be hit by legislation such as Schatz’s proposal. Libra is similar to stable coins but would be backed by several different currencies and debt instruments rather than by only the U.S. dollar.

The crux of the crypto lobby’s pitch is that the bitcoin network is completely decentralized and open to anyone to join. Because no single entity controls bitcoin, regulators can’t turn to any firm or individual to enforce potential rule violations, said Jerry Brito, who runs Coin Center Inc., a nonprofit that promotes bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.

The Libra Assn., on the other hand, decides which organizations are allowed to manage transactions on its network. And while the Libra Assn. could make the disclosures required by securities laws, bitcoin doesn’t have a corporate parent.

“If bitcoin were classified as a security, who would make the disclosure? It’s unworkable,” Brito said. “We have to educate people on that.”

Some lawmakers have long viewed that lack of central control a problem rather than a feature. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Northridge) told Bloomberg TV after the Libra hearings in July that he “absolutely” believes all cryptocurrencies should be illegal. Cryptocurrency “serves no function unless somebody is engaged in nefarious transactions,” Sherman said.

Brito said his goal is to stop lawmakers from conflating bitcoin and Libra. He said his organization has already seen draft legislation from lawmakers who want to contain Libra and tried to guide them to ensure they also don’t stomp on bitcoin.

Bitcoin and Libra “aren’t rivals. They’re completely different things,” Brito said.",2019-08-28 00:00:00.000,https://news.bitcoin.com/erc20-tether-transactions-flip-their-omni-equivalent/,"ERC20 Tether Transactions Flip Their Omni Equivalent

Crypto enthusiasts have noticed that the Ethereum blockchain has come awfully close to reaching capacity due to the added transactions stemming from the Tether (USDT) network. The transaction count since mid-August shows the ERC20 version of tether has surpassed the original version that uses BTC. ERC20 tether transactions cost users more than $260,000 in the last 30 days and the over-saturation of trades is 17X larger than the infamous Crypto Kitties fiasco.

Tether Migrating to ETH Sparks Capacity Fears

In December 2017 during the height of the crypto bull run, the Ethereum blockchain was swamped with unique cats similar to Pusheens that could be collected and traded using the ETH network. The Crypto Kitties event prompted the creators to increase the cat birthing fee in order to incentivize miners to add birthing transactions to the chain. Fast forward to 2019 and Tether has started migrating coins from the Omni Layer network which uses the BTC chain to an ERC20 version which runs on top of the ETH chain. Tether is a $4 billion dollar network with coins spread across multiple blockchains which include BTC (Omni), ETH (ERC20), EOS, and Tron. Data pulled from the website Coin Metrics shows that the ETH-based tether transactions have surpassed the BTC-based versions this month. Today, on August 28, there are 39,000 tether transactions on the BTC network via Omni, but that number is eclipsed by the 126,000 ETH-based tether transactions. At the time of publication, there’s roughly 1.5 billion USDT minted using the ETH chain and 2.5 billion tied to the Omni Layer network.

Since the tether transactions being used on the ETH chain have spiked significantly, the crypto community has been observing the ETH chain grow congested again. Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin told Bloomberg this week that the “[ETH] blockchain has been almost full for years.” ““I think it’s still good to develop apps, but anything substantial should be developed with scalability techniques in mind, so that it can survive higher transaction fees that would come with further growing demand for Ethereum — In the longer term, Ethereum 2.0’s sharding will, of course, fix these issues,” Buterin asserted during the interview. Prominent Ethereum evangelist and founder of Mythos Ryan Sean Adams explained that every asset on Ethereum is “a future revenue source for ETH stakers.” “Tether paid 993 ETH over the last 30 days,” Adams said to further bolster his prior statement.

For Stablecoin Use Cases Like Trading and Arbitrage, the Market Demands Faster Transactions and Lower Fees

The tether migration to Ethereum has been quite noticeable and Coin Metrics’ Nic Carter published data concerning Tether’s growth and transition to Ethereum. “USDT-ETH active addresses (the count of unique addresses that were active in the network as a recipient or originator of a ledger change) skyrocketed over the past week, jumping from 38,600 on August 19 to over 78,800 on 8/23,” the report notes.

“Meanwhile, USDT-OMNI active addresses continue to decline, despite two recent spikes.” The report also notes that the migration from Omni to Ethereum may have stemmed from market demand. “The primary use case for Tether is for active trading and arbitrage — For these use cases, Tether on Ethereum is faster (15-second blocks for Ethereum versus 10-minute blocks for Bitcoin) and require less fees,” the Coin Metrics’ State of the Network research explains. The report adds:

Since these characteristics are desirable for active traders, Tether issuance on Ethereum should continue to grow relative to issuance on Omni. The recent burn in Tether came solely from Tether issued on Omni.

Stablecoin Networks Using the Bitcoin Cash Network Will Benefit From Low Fees and More Capacity

Despite Tether’s move to the ETH chain, a few digital currency fans believe that there could be issues with the ERC20-styled tethers if the network grows too congested. Some skeptics and observers think tether users are paying way too much in network fees. On the bitcoin cash-oriented Reddit forum r/btc, some BCH supporters said that it would be far cheaper to host a popular stablecoin like tether on the BCH chain.

“Tether transactions alone pay $14,000 in transaction fees for 120,000 transactions every single day on Ethereum (a total of $57,000),” Reddit user u/eyeofpython remarked. “With a daily volume of $400,000,000 (source: SQL query on eth.events for the 23 August) — If Tether were to move to BCH, people would only pay $120 of fees in total.” On August 28, the average BCH network fee is only $0.004 per transaction, while the gas needed to push an ERC20 token is between $0.11-0.16 per transaction. Another BCH supporter wrote:

Tether should switch to SLP tokens on the Bitcoin Cash network, which never gets congested, unlike BTC and ETH.

Over the last few days, there have also been discussions as to whether ETH’s capacity can handle various apps alongside Tether. The number of transactions stemming from tether users has grown every year since the stablecoin launched and currently represents 30% of all cryptocurrency trades, rising at times to 40%. At the time of publication, tether (USDT) captures a whopping 77% of all BTC trades, 53% of ETH, and 54% of BCH trades worldwide.

Tether continues to dominate, despite the fact there’s a slew of other stablecoins competing like USDC, DAI, TUSD, and USDH. Most of the stablecoin competitors use the ETH network as well, which presents another set of capacity problems for the chain. The stablecoin Honestcoin (USDH) does not use the BTC or ETH chain and is built on top of the BCH network using the Simple Ledger Protocol. USDH and its nascent network only has a $32,000 market capitalization and $173,000 in global trade volume. However, traders using stablecoins for quick swaps and arbitrage will quickly find that transaction fees at $0.004 per transaction or less are far cheaper.

The cryptocurrency firm has only just been issued a conditional banking and securities dealer license in Switzerland — and now aims to become a fully regulated bank on the island nation so it can provide a full suite of financial services.

Becoming a full-fledged, regulated crypto bank

Sygnum co-founder and chief strategy officer Gerald Goh said its application for the Singapore license will get underway once it becomes a fully fledged Swiss bank later this year.

The financial services it would be able to offer include custodial services for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), as well as conversions between the two cryptocurrencies and Swiss francs, euros, Singapore dollars and U.S. dollars.

As a regulated bank, Sygnum will also be able to roll out digital asset custody, brokerage and tokenization services for accredited investors and institutions.

Fellow co-founder and Sygnum CEO Mathias Imbach said:

“We have been approached over the past few months by many parties who hold a lot of cryptocurrencies and look for a fully regulated bank. One of their biggest challenges is to find banking specialists to connect them to the real world, to pay their taxes, their employees’ salary.”

Zeroing in on compliance

To date, Sygnum has raised roughly 60 million Swiss francs ($61 million), including investments from institutions such as Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.

Chua Kimg Leng — former special advisor for financial supervision at the Monetary Authority of Singapore — sits on the company’s board and heads its internal Anti-Money Laundering committee.

All board directors and roughly 85% of employees at the firm are shareholders.

As it awaits regulatory approval, Sygnum's CEO said the company is focusing on carrying out robust due diligence on all new potential clients to mitigate money laundering risks.

This spring, Cointelegraph reported that Sygnum had partnered with global market infrastructure provider Deutsche Borse Group and Swiss state-owned telecoms and ICT firm Swisscom to build out a compliant financial market infrastructure for digital assets.

Sygnum and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) also this week finalized a banking and securities dealer license for cryptocurrency firm Seba Crypto AG.

On Aug. 26, FINMA published new guidance on regulatory requirements for blockchain-based payments.",,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/28/australian-who-says-he-invented-bitcoin-ordered-to-hand-over-up-to-5bn,"The Australian man who claimed to have invented cryptocurrency bitcoin has been ordered to hand over half of his alleged bitcoin holdings, reported to be worth up to $5bn.

The IT security consultant Craig Wright, 49, was sued by the estate of David Kleiman, a programmer who died in 2013, for a share of Wright’s bitcoin haul over the pair’s involvement in the inception of the cryptocurrency from 2009 to 2013.

Kleiman’s estate alleges Wright and Kleiman were partners, and therefore his family is entitled to a share of the bitcoin that was mined by the pair in that time. Wright denies there was a partnership.

A US district court in Florida on Tuesday ruled that half of the bitcoin mined and half of the intellectual property held by Wright from that time belongs to Kleiman.

One issue is it is not known exactly how much bitcoin Wright holds. It has been claimed that the Kleiman estate could get anywhere between 410,000 and 500,000 bitcoin, putting the value at between A$6.1bn and A$7.4bn as of Wednesday.

Wright claimed to the court that he couldn’t access the bitcoin because he doesn’t have a list of the public addresses of that bitcoin. He claimed in 2011, after seeing the cryptocurrency had begun to be associated with drug dealers and human traffickers, he put the bitcoin he mined in 2009 and 2010 into an encrypted file and into a blind trust. The encrypted key was divided into multiple key slices, and the key slices were given to Kleiman who distributed them to people through the trust.

Wright said this meant he could not decrypt the file until he gets access to the key from a bonded courier who will arrive in January 2020 – a claim Wright has made before in claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin.

In the judgment, Judge Bruce Reinhart said Wright had not proved he could not comply and obtain the bitcoin. He said Wright made inconsistent statements and the whole story was “inconceivable” that he’d had a Dr Frankenstein-like revelation when his creation “turned to evil”.

“During his testimony, Dr. Wright’s demeanor did not impress me as someone who was telling the truth. When it was favorable to him, Dr. Wright appeared to have an excellent memory and a scrupulous attention to detail. Otherwise, Dr. Wright was belligerent and evasive,” Reinhart said.

In 2015, Wright was investigated by the Australian Taxation Office over his involvement with bitcoin with his Sydney home raided by the Australian federal police, leading to speculation he might be Nakamoto.

In 2016, Wright claimed he was Nakamoto, but experts questioned the evidence he provided. He promised to provide further proof, but backed down days later, saying he was “sorry” and did “not have the courage”.

Reinhart said at the start of his ruling the court “is not required to decide, and does not decide” whether Wright is Nakamoto, and the court was not required to decide and did not decide how much bitcoin Wright controls today.",2019-08-28 00:00:00.000,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-salaries-gain-regulatory-recognition-around-the-world/,"Crypto Salaries Gain Regulatory Recognition Around the World

Salaries paid in decentralized digital coins have become a norm across the crypto industry, but there’s really no reason why cryptocurrencies can’t be used for remuneration by businesses in other sectors as well. In many jurisdictions that should be legal even in the absence of dedicated legislation. Switzerland, New Zealand, Japan and Estonia are a few examples. Companies and employees in these countries take advantage of the benefits that come with crypto payments.

Temptation to Tax Crypto Income Works in Favor of Bitcoin Wages

Switzerland has already established itself as a crypto-friendly nation and it is a role model in many respects, including the way it treats cryptocurrency remuneration. Many leading companies and projects in the crypto space have already set up offices or are headquartered in the Swiss Crypto Valley, centered in the Canton of Zug. The long list includes names such as Shapeshift, Xapo, Bitmain, the Ethereum Foundation and most recently the Libra Association.

For many decades, the Alpine federation was a good example of geopolitical neutrality and financial privacy. The latter has been somewhat degraded in the past few years under pressure from powerful players such as the U.S. and the EU. However, decentralized digital currencies are offering Switzerland a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of account holders, and the country has embraced the opportunity.

Many aspects of dealing with crypto assets have been regulated already by the Swiss authorities and that includes taxation. People who receive cryptocurrency as wage income need to declare it and pay tax, just like with fiat salaries. Crypto gains of investors and traders are treated as tax-exempt capital gains but depending on the canton, you may have to pay wealth tax which is levied on the total amount of digital coins you hold, similar to cash or precious metals.

In a confederation like Switzerland, there are multiple levels of income taxation – federal, cantonal, and municipal. Regulations vary from one administrative unit to another and income tax can be progressive or proportional. Amounts owed also depend on the marital status of the taxpayer. The scope of taxable income covers all funds accruing to a natural person from all sources. That includes remuneration received in various forms, including digital.

Cryptocurrency Remuneration Spreads in Friendly Jurisdictions

Switzerland is undoubtedly a leader in creating favorable conditions for crypto businesses, but other nations have been quickly catching up. Among those where crypto salaries are a working option are Japan, Estonia, and the United States. For example, Japanese internet giant GMO announced some time ago that its almost 5,000 employees will be able to receive part of their salaries in cryptocurrency. And this spring, U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken revealed it paid 250 salaries in bitcoin in April.

Crypto companies registered in Estonia, considered to be one of the most advanced digital societies, are often partially compensating or encouraging their employees with cryptocurrencies and tokens. The Baltic nation’s legislation provides for the taxation of such income. But even in jurisdictions where cryptocurrencies are yet to be legalized, crypto salaries are possible. In Russia, for example, half of fintech companies pay their employees with coins.

The crypto industry is not restricted by national boundaries. Cryptocurrencies significantly improve the speed and reliability of cross-border payments and the growing gig economy is taking advantage of the benefits of frictionless digital money. According to a study from 2017, freelancers will form a majority of the workforce in the United States within a decade. And a survey on payment preferences conducted in 2018 shows that a third of them would like to be paid partially or entirely in cryptocurrency.

Crypto-paid remote jobs are rapidly spreading in the global economy as well, thanks to the services offered by companies like Bitwage. It’s also getting easier to find a job paid in cryptocurrency with the help of platforms such as Workingforbitcoins.

New Zealand Tax Authority Adopts Rules for Crypto Payroll

Generally speaking, crypto salaries don’t really need dedicated legislation or special permissions by authorities to be legal. Many countries allow part of an employee’s compensation to be paid with non-monetary assets like commodities. And in jurisdictions where digital coins are not yet recognized as currencies, they have been granted a commodity status. Thus, cryptocurrencies can still be paid and received as fringe benefits.

Nevertheless, it does look like a step forward when a government agency explicitly mentions crypto wages in its official documents. And that’s what the tax authority in New Zealand recently did, deeming it legal for businesses to pay their employees in bitcoin. Companies will now be able to withhold tax on income payments under the existing pay-as-you-earn schemes like those of regular fiat salaries, as per the country’s current tax legislation.

The clarifications were made in an information bulletin issued earlier this month by New Zealand’s Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The ruling will go into effect on Sept. 1, 2019 and will be valid for the next three years. And while crypto enthusiasts have welcomed the arrangement as one that can encourage crypto adoption, doubters have expressed concerns its only goal is to ensure the collection of more taxes by the government in Wellington.

As expected from a regulator, the green light comes with multiple conditions. First of all, only employees working under official agreements can be paid with cryptocurrency. Then, the payments must be for a fixed amount, not exceeding half of the full pay, with the value of the crypto asset pegged to one or more fiat currencies. The crypto wages must be a regular part of the employee’s remuneration and be convertible into government-issued fiat money like the New Zealand Dollar.

The IRD also pointed out that salaries must be paid in a coin that can function as a currency, a substitute to fiat. This requirement aims to protect employees from being paid in an illiquid asset or small altcoin.

The tax agency listed several decentralized cryptocurrencies that meet its criteria. These are bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin core (BTC), bitcoin gold (BTG), ethereum (ETH), and litecoin (LTC). The revenue department also thinks stablecoins such as tether (USDT), or any of its alternatives that are easily convertible to fiat, qualify for that role as well.

In late July, the agency started sending letters to more than 10,000 cryptocurrency holders, warning that they may have violated federal tax laws.

This should not have come as a surprise to anyone, but it’s surely creating headaches for taxpayers and tax professionals who haven’t been sweating the details on cryptocurrency for the last few years. The good news is, it’s not too late to get up to speed. The bad news is, the days of getting a pass by claiming ignorance on the finer points of cryptocurrency tax compliance have come to an end.

At first, confusion about how to deal with the tax side of virtual currency was understandable. At the end of 2013, right when the cryptocurrency hype cycle was starting and bitcoin was valued at roughly $650, major banks, tech companies and accounting firms were convening industry summits to figure out whether cryptocurrency would be taxed as a capital asset, like a stock or a commodity, and thus subject to capital gains rates, or as a fiat currency, such as dollars, euros and yen, for which gains are generally taxed as ordinary income.

By March of 2014, though, the IRS had issued clear guidance on virtual currencies , explaining that it will tax the digital assets as property, not currency. What followed was a five-year drumbeat of announcements and actions that made it clear the IRS was getting serious about crypto. In November of 2016, the agency filed a John Doe summons to the bitcoin trading platform Coinbase, asking for names and other information of everyone who is trading bitcoin. Then, in the summer of 2018, as the price of bitcoin had climbed above the $8,000 mark, the IRS’s Large Business & International Division launched a compliance campaign into how investors who own bitcoin are filing their taxes.

It should have been clear by then that what was once the Wild West was now being carefully monitored. Still, the IRS warning letters issued last month caught many recipients off guard. The reason, of course, is that many people — even tax professionals — still don’t really understand the details of how cryptocurrency is being taxed.

Sure, the IRS categorizes cryptocurrency as property, but keeping track of the tax basis for that piece of property is not as straightforward as many other assets. For one, the price is wildly volatile. This July, the price of bitcoin topped $12,000, which is more than three times its value in December of 2018. In order to accurately calculate gain or loss, anyone selling their bitcoin needs to keep track of its value the day they received it and the day they sold it, and also factor in different tax brackets and other variables that can impact the total amount owed to the IRS. For those who are transacting with bitcoin frequently, those calculations can become exponentially complicated.

Fortunately, the IRS’ steady ramp-up in enforcement acknowledges this complexity, and even those cryptocurrency holders who have received letters still have time to get their houses in order. To help them get started, the following is a general primer on how virtual currency taxes will affect the three primary types of cryptocurrency holders.

Cryptocurrency miners

Many cryptocurrency miners are under the mistaken impression that they are only subject to tax on the amount it costs them to mine the bitcoin. However, according to the IRS, when a bitcoin is mined, the miner is supposed to keep track of what the asset was valued at on that day, and subsequently treat that value as income.



Miners that are engaged in a trade or business are subject to ordinary income, plus self-employment tax. The value of the coin becomes the tax basis, and if you trade or use that bitcoin later, then you have to include in income the value of what you get, minus that tax basis. That requires onerous record-keeping, which many bitcoin miners are not currently set up to do, but is vital to staying compliant with the IRS.

Vendors accepting bitcoin as payment

In May, AT&T announced it would begin accepting bitcoin , which could well be a harbinger of the future of e-commerce. But not all businesses are created equal. A huge corporation like AT&T has armies of accountants and accounting firms to keep track of these transactions. Most, if not all, small businesses don’t have that luxury.

Take, for instance, a small retailer or a consultant that may begin accepting bitcoin. When that small business receives the cryptocurrency, that value is included in the business’s income. But at that moment in time, they now need to track their tax basis in the bitcoin they receive.

For example, if a company sells something for $5,000 in bitcoin, but then uses the bitcoin to buy something else a year later when the price has climbed to $10,000, they now have a reportable gain of $5,000. It’s easy to see how confusing this can get for businesses that don’t have the resources to employ a full-time accounting team to track the daily value of their digital assets.

Investors

While there are many different types of cryptocurrency investors, the principle for them all is roughly the same: Investors have to track when they acquire and how they use the bitcoin.

If an investor is in the business of selling bitcoin, it will be taxed differently than if an investor is engaged in casual tinkering in the cryptocurrency market. The gain recognized by bitcoin sellers will be taxed at ordinary income rates (with a top rate of 37 percent). However, those not in the trade or business of selling bitcoins will benefit from lower capital gains rates (with a top rate of 20 percent).

Employers could also start using bitcoin to pay employees. If they do that, it will add another layer of complexity because the bitcoin would need to be reported on W-2 wages, income tax withholding, employment taxes, etc.

Be prepared

Whether you’ve already received one of these letters from the IRS or you do in the future, it’s undoubtedly unsettling. Frankly, it seems threatening. Rest assured, though, that it is just part of the forced education process the IRS is introducing to the cryptocurrency marketplace. The IRS is essentially putting cryptocurrency holders on notice: We know you have this, and you’re probably treating it improperly on your taxes. That’s why it’s so vital that practitioners help their clients get their ducks in a row. Tax professionals need to change their practice to make sure they are asking and tracking all relevant data. Otherwise, eventually those IRS warning letters will become audits.",2019-08-28 17:27:27.005,https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-regulation-is-the-best-thing-for-crypto,"When we hear about holders of crypto being tracked down by the Internal Revenue Service, or that imprisonment is being considered for anyone using crypto in India, it conjures up a disconcerting image of what regulation might entail.

It’s part of crypto’s DNA to be unregulated, some might say. It falls outside the scope of government and should remain so for all the reasons it was created in the first place.

But if crypto is the future and there are valid concerns, then surely these should be addressed. If we want crypto to be accepted and become part of our everyday lives, then we need to engage in the debate and embrace reasonable and responsible regulation. Even the most devout supporters, who wish nothing more than to see crypto succeed on a mass scale, could agree that the growth of this industry depends, in part, on the establishment of safe, fair and reliable market conditions.

Presently, the regulatory climate is still uncertain and fragmented across jurisdictions. However, recent developments seem to suggest that we find ourselves at a turning point. The contours of a global regulatory framework are coming into focus, and we should welcome it.

An emerging framework

Global

On July 15, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a compelling document containing a useful typology of digital money, an assessment of the risks it poses and policy recommendations. It posits that privately issued stablecoins pose a number of risks to consumers and financial stability, citing liquidity risk, default risk, market risk and foreign exchange risk as comprising the primary concerns.

It argues that digital assets and cryptocurrencies could be attractive and see capital inflows away from fiat currencies in countries with high inflation rates and weak institutions. It furthermore notes that it is hard for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), such as crypto exchanges, to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) regulations when assets are underpinned by decentralized technology and stakeholders are spread across jurisdictions.

But it also provides some solutions. Central banks could play a role in providing issuers of stablecoins with access to central reserves. To prevent monopolies from forming and to protect monetary policy, they could consider issuing their own digital currency, such as what is currently being considered in China. However, to drive innovation in the private sector, the IMF document favors public-private partnerships instead.

Central banks could grant licenses — on the condition of supervision — and hold VASPs accountable for customer screening, transaction monitoring and reporting suspicious activity in accordance with Know Your Customer (KYC), AML and CFT regulations. Industry standards could also be defined for the security of wallets and client data.

The paper from the IMF does stress, however, that any regulation should be applied in proportion to the risks and types of services offered, and that international cooperation is crucial to prevent regulatory arbitrage.

We can see the first attempts at such cooperation being made with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) recently introduced travel rule, which requires VASPs to collect and transfer customer information when processing transactions. Although the FATF’s guidance is not legally binding, the G-20 has declared it will follow the FATF’s guidance.

Domestic: The United Kingdom

But it’s not just at the global level that we’re seeing the crystallization of a regulatory framework. For example, in July, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published two important documents. The first was its “Guidance on Cryptoassets,” which, after extensive industry consultation, makes a clear assessment and distinction between exchange tokens, utility tokens and security tokens — while recognizing that some assets may fall within multiple categories. The second document published by the FCA proposes rules to ban the sale of crypto derivatives to retail investors on account of them being less-equipped in their ability to assess the risks of these types of complex, often volatile financial products.

In studying the FCA’s guidance, a number of remarks are worth making.

Firstly, the U.K.’s overall approach is not all that different from other jurisdictions, such as, say, Singapore, Hong Kong or even the United States, where special attention is given to crypto assets that have the characteristics of securities — i.e., tokens that constitute equity, debt or are part of a collective investment scheme.

Secondly, the documents provide fairly clear guidance with regard to the regulatory status of crypto assets, as they aim to strike a balance between leaving the field open for financial innovation while ensuring retail investor protection.

Thirdly, the FCA’s guidance comes at an interesting time. According to the financial advisory firm deVere Group, the U.K. finds itself in a unique position as it nears its exit from the European Union. This could present itself as an opportunity to chart a new course to potentially turn the U.K. into a crypto-friendly hub in a similar fashion to Switzerland and Japan.

So, what’s driving these processes, and why should an industry that has so far enjoyed nearly unbridled freedom be positive about new regulatory restrictions?

External and internal push factors

Libra cannot be ignored here. When a giant tech company, with a 2.4 billion-strong user base and supported by the likes of MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, seeks to enter the space, it is significant.

Looking past sensationalist coverage, highlighting how Facebook was grilled in U.S. Congress over its proposal, we’re actually seeing the stirrings of a healthy debate. If anything, Libra has served to elevate the discourse about what governments ought to do about this phenomenon called cryptocurrency, which, according to Bitwise, has moved crypto at least three years ahead.

Related: Facebook Libra Regulatory Overview: Major Countries' Stances on Crypto

“Facebook’s Libra project has generated renewed interest in digital currencies and blockchain,” and “with the appropriate balance of regulation, digital currencies, and their innovative underlying technology, could provide meaningful benefits,” U.S. Republican Sen. Mike Crapo said at the Hearing on Digital Currencies and Blockchain on July 30, 2019.

Similarly, increased involvement in the industry from traditional market participants in finance, like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Fidelity Digital Assets Services, can only add further impetus to this debate — especially considering the recent findings of a Fidelity Investments survey, which revealed that unclear regulation is among the major obstacles deterring institutional investors from adding crypto to their portfolio.

But apart from these external push factors, a similar drive can be observed from within the industry itself. It is marked by the rise of a new generation of cryptocurrency and digital asset exchanges, built in collaboration with traditional exchange operators.

Bakkt, for example, which is a Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading platform, was created by the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. ErisX counts Nasdaq as one of its investors. Likewise, at our own exchange, AAX, our matching engine is powered by LSEG Technology, which is part of London Stock Exchange Group.

What these exchanges have in common is a shared recognition that institutional-grade technology and a proactive approach toward regulatory compliance are vital to creating the conditions fit to accommodate institutional investors and bring serious capital into the market.

According to a report published on Aug. 26 by Portuguese business newspaper Jornal de Negócios, the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority have confirmed that crypto transactions or payments are exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT).

The agency reportedly provided the clarification to a local crypto mining company, publishing an official ruling document. In the document, the authority states that the exchange of crypto for fiat money is free of VAT, adding that crypto users do not have to pay any income tax.

Portugal cites a 2015 ruling for crypto tax exempt

In the official statement, the Portuguese tax authority cited a 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice regarding the case involving major Swedish Bitcoin (BTC) portal Bitcoin.se and its moderator David Hedqvist.

As reported at the time, the court ordered that Bitcoin is a means of payment and that the exchange should therefore be exempted VAT obligations. However, the Swedish Tax Agency subsequently argued against the ruling, claiming that the court did not fully understand the matter.

Earlier stance on crypto

The confirmation follows a previous tax ruling by the Portuguese tax authority that cryptocurrencies are not taxed in the country. A document published by the agency in 2016 states that income from the sale of crypto in Portugal is not subject to income tax.

Earlier in 2013, the central bank of Portugal, the Banco de Portugal issued a statement citing a 2012 crypto-related paper by the European Central Bank.

The Portuguese bank raised concerns over the ECB’s Bitcoin recognition as a “phenomenon of innovation in virtual currency models,” claiming that Bitcoin cannot be considered a safe currency as it its issued by unregulated entities.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrencies-such-as-bitcoin-cash-shine-during-hong-kong-protests/,"Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin Cash Shine During Hong Kong Protests

The Hong Kong protests started in June 2019 over a controversial bill and now after weeks of demonstrations, marching citizens are fighting for the future of Hong Kong. In the midst of all the activists protesting, digital currencies like bitcoin cash are being promoted as a way for people to remove themselves from China’s system.

Hong Kong Protests Continue Into the 12th Week

It’s been more than 12 weeks of protests in Hong Kong that started with the 2019 extradition bill called the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance. The bill claims to be an act designed to stop fugitive refugees from hiding as it would allow Chinese law enforcement to extradite anyone from Hong Kong to mainland China if they are accused of a crime. Many Hong Kong citizens fear the extradition bill could prompt the Chinese government to arbitrarily imprison anyone from the country. 130,000 demonstrators marched against the bill on April 28. After the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, showed she was ready to bring the 2019 extradition bill to legislature, over 1 million people protested in the streets on June 9. On the anniversary of the British handover of Hong Kong on July 1, a large number of protesters charged the Legislative Council. In August, activists stormed the Hong Kong international travel hub and the airport had to suspend flights for days.

Even though the bill was put on hold by Lam because of the intensity of the protests, the activists protesting demand more. Leaders of the protest have cited specific demands and the first is completely abolishing the extradition bill forever. The protestors also want the government to remove the changed classification for peaceful protests, which coincidentally is now defined as “riots.” The activists are also demanding an “independent inquiry” into the Hong Kong police force and the government must remove charges brought against protestors who have participated in past demonstrations. Lastly, those who are protesting and support the movement want a slice of independence from China. Protestors demand a better form of universal suffrage that does not stem from China and allows citizens to vote for leaders in a democratic fashion. Also, Hong Kong independence proponent Chen Haotian tried to incite a bank run on Chinese banks operating in the country last week. Haotian believes that a mass bank run in Hong Kong would hurt China’s financial system that’s tethered to the country’s economy.

Hong Kong Crypto Adoption Grows During the Demonstrations

In the midst of the Hong Kong protests, certain individuals and groups are pushing for cryptocurrency adoption in the area. One organization called Genesis Block has been distributing bottles of water and umbrellas to demonstrators protesting in the streets of Hong Kong. Genesis Block is well known for its cryptocurrency workspace in the Wan Chai district and was also one of the entities that mined some of the first bitcoin cash (BCH) blocks in August 2017. The cryptocurrency workspace promotes a range of digital assets but the peer-to-peer digital cash system BCH is promoted a lot more.

In order to bolster the crypto facilities within the region, Genesis Block has installed 14 cryptocurrency automated teller machines (ATMs) throughout the country. During large protests over the last few weeks, Genesis Block handed out water bottles to protesters which had a BCH logo and the bottle read “免费派水 (free water).” On the water bottle’s label next to the BCH logo, there’s a QR code that leads to the website Bch-hkg.com. The web portal is a Bitcoin Cash explainer and teaches people from Hong Kong how to download a wallet and use BCH to spread freedom. The translated message on the website states:

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was created to achieve the original purpose of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system — Bitcoin cash is fast, inexpensive and reliable as it’s medium of exchange and store of value.

Additionally, there are groups who are using cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash to fund charitable efforts like the body of people known as Snowden’s Guardian Angels. In 2013, these individuals and families helped shelter the whistleblower Edward Snowden when many governments were looking to capture him. Snowden’s Guardian Angels were families who reside in Hong Kong and they are accepting bitcoin cash donations for their efforts. Another group that’s accepting bitcoin cash donations is the nonprofit organization Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP). The group is run by independent journalists who promise to be immune to commercial and political pressure. Independent journalism is valued during times of protest because reporters can tell the public how things are being perceived from a non-biased view. Bitcoin Cash proponents can support HKFP by donating to the nonprofit here.

There are also a few BCH accepting merchants in Hong Kong including the male-only salon Men’s Bash, Craft Brew & Co, the bookstore cafe Garden Meow, and Aerial Studios. Moreover, on August 23, the Hong Kong Bitcoin Association announced on Twitter that the department store Pricerite has begun accepting BTC via the Lightning Network. Pricerite will also accept litecoin (LTC) and ethereum (ETH) at its store in the Megabox shopping center. Apart from merchant acceptance, bitcoin cash trading has increased as well, according to swaps made on the Local.Bitcoin.com BCH marketplace. One trader has purchased BCH 195 times on the peer-to-peer platform using the stablecoins USDC and USDH. A few other traders from Hong Kong have completed 20-40 bitcoin cash trades on Local.Bitcoin.com over the last two months.

There have also been a few instances where BTC prices have seen a premium in Hong Kong as spot prices on the exchange Tidebit have been $75-250 higher than the global average. For instance, the price of BTC today on Tidebit is 76,500 HKD, which is $250 higher than the average spot price worldwide. No one knows exactly how the Hong Kong protests will turn out, but it seems many people think it’s a great opportunity to spread the idea of a currency that’s not controlled by a state entity.

Coin burning is a method by which cryptocurrencies keep their market value high and attempt to offset inflation. When a large portion of a coin’s supply is removed, that coin experiences heightened demand, and as a result, the coin’s price goes up.

At least, that’s how it works in theory. In practice, any price increases that occur immediately after a coin burn usually get lost in the noise. The effects of coin burns are usually overshadowed by the long-term price volatility of the entire crypto market, as shown below:

Since most coins experience very similar price changes, it’s hard to say which ones have gotten the best results from coin burning. With that in mind, we’ll look at several burn strategies that have been enacted – and whether some of those strategies are better than others.

Burning the Circulating Supply

Many cryptocurrencies burn tokens that are in circulation – that is, they eliminate tokens that are being traded or held by investors. This means that the organization that issues the cryptocurrency must buy it back from coinholders and exchanges.

Binance does this a few times per year: its 7th coin burn destroyed 830,000 BNB ($16 million) in this way. VeChain and TRON use a similar model as well. This strategy has one advantage:the size of the burn is largely determined by market forces and price action.

The downside is that these burns do not always attract a lot of attention, and the results can be minimal. After two years, Binance has burned about 6% of its BNB supply. TRON, meanwhile, intends to burn $20 million worth of TRX over one year, adding up to 1.7% of its total supply.

Burning the Non-Circulating Supply

Sometimes, coin burns remove tokens that are not in circulation, such as tokens that are allocated to team members, early investors, or the project itself. EOS, for example, recently burned an account containing 34 million EOS (~$150 million) following a community vote.

Binance, meanwhile, has burned 808,000 BNB that was allocated to its team, thereby removing $24 million from Binance Coin’s supply. Presumably, it is easy to burn a large amount of funds in this way, since the funds in question are often located in just a few large accounts.

However, since these tokens are not in general circulation, this sort of burn should not have a large effect on the market (or on prices). This is complicated even further by the fact that there is no universal agreement on what constitutes a coin’s “circulating supply.”

Burning During Each Transaction

Some cryptocurrencies burn tokens during every transaction. VeChain, for example, burns about 70% of its VTHO tokens, which are used to pay for transaction fees. (VTHO should not be confused with VeChain’s primary VET token, which is being burned via buybacks.)

Ripple follows a similar strategy: it burns about 0.5 XRP per minute, which adds up to more than 250,000 XRP per year (though this is subject to change). This strategy has a few things in its favor: it’s very easy to coordinate, and it shouldn’t have any unexpected results since it plays out slowly.

By spreading small burns across many transactions, this strategy should prevent any short-term market cap drops. It should also reduce confusion and misunderstanding among investors, thereby preventing secondary effects such as “panic selling” and other irregular activity.

Unofficial Burns, Dead Addresses, and Lost Coins

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not issued by a central organization or project. Since these coins are mined by a community, there is no group capable of planning an official coin burn. Instead, rules and algorithms prevent too many tokens from being created in the first place.

That said, wealthy groups can take it upon themselves to carry out a burn. Antpool, a popular mining pool, began to burn Bitcoin Cash transaction fees in 2018. This was extremely controversial, and there was plenty of disagreement over whether this was a legitimate way to boost Bitcoin Cash’s value.

Coins can also be destroyed inadvertently, as occurs whenever individuals lose access to their wallet addresses. Some estimates suggest that up to 3.8 million BTC has been permanently lost. Even if this is accidental, it is effectively the same as burning 20% of Bitcoin’s supply.

Price-Targeted Burning

Some cryptocurrencies have managed to fine-tune their burning strategy in order to achieve a specific price. Tether and other stablecoins continually burn (and create) tokens, and the end result is that stablecoin prices always rest around the $1.00 market.

This strategy isn’t generally applicable: Tether relies on U.S. dollars as collateral, and this allows it to achieve stability. Though the full process is quite complex, Tether’s coin burns basically reflect the fact that U.S. dollars are moving out of its reserves.

This means that coin burns reflect, not dictate, Tether’s stability. As such, most cryptocurrencies cannot target prices as precisely as stablecoins do. Furthermore, even stablecoins experience minor price fluctuations, as burns cannot always keep up with market activity.

Do Coin Burns Really Work?

It seems safe to say that, if nothing else, coin burns aren’t doing any harm to cryptocurrency prices. After all, if coin burns did produce extremely undesirable results, the projects that rely on coin burns would end the practice.

The fact that many crypto projects have stuck with their original burning strategy is a good sign—especially since coin burns don’t seem to have immediately noticeable effects on coin prices. This is partly due to the fact that many strategies involve burning tokens on a small scale.

That’s not a bad thing, though: the full impact of coin burns should become more apparent over the next several years, assuming that cryptocurrencies stay dedicated to their strategies. Of course, coin burns could go out of style at any moment as well, so it’s hard to say exactly what will happen.",2019-08-29 12:17:58+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/un-official-cryptocurrency-makes-policing-child-trafficking-exceptionally-difficult,"A top United Nations (UN) official said cryptocurrencies are making international efforts to combat terrorist financing, money laundering and cyber-crime “exceptionally difficult.”

Neil Walsh, chief of the Cybercrime and Anti-Money Laundering arm of the UN’s Office on Drugs and Crime, said that the anonymizing and pseudo-anonymizing attributes of cryptocurrencies provide a “new layer of secrecy that favors the criminals,” when speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s Linda Mottram.

Specifically, Walsh raised concerns about the role cryptocurrencies play in the clandestine child trafficking industry.

“In the past, when we looked at some of the really big high-threat areas like kids getting abused online, it had to be paid for and now, with the use of cryptocurrencies, it’s exceptionally difficult for investigators to track that and try and manage that risk down,” Walsh said.

Walsh said the trade now runs on cryptocurrency, later adding that “child abusers are successful when they can create secrecy,” adding:

“When you add a layer that is encrypted that is anonymous or pseudo-anonymous, then it makes it very difficult for investigators to counter that challenge and also, it really makes it easier for the bad guys to do what they do, and that creates risks, especially for our children.”

Further, Walsh said efforts should target crypto exchanges where illicit funds may be washed. Added security protocols would not interfere with the average user, he suggested, as “there isn’t really a large amount of risk around declaring who you are and that you have an interest in moving value.”

Walsh highlighted efforts put forward by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as one possible way of tracking who might be moving value using cryptocurrencies.

In June, FATF, the intergovernmental organization devoted to combating money laundering and terrorism financing, finalized its recommendations on regulating cryptocurrencies for its 37 member countries, including a rule that “virtual asset service providers” (VASPs), meaning crypto exchanges, enact the so-called “travel rule.”

Under this stipulation, exchanges and wallet providers would be required to have know-your-customer information not only for their own users, but also for the users of wallets or exchange accounts that funds are being sent to.

“We’re still waiting to see how that plays out,” Walsh said, but he added that the U.N. has brought together policymakers and experts to work on finding the best policy to regulate the space.

“We’ve brought together those policymakers, lawyers, those cryptocurrency experts to try and look what policy might look like in this space, because when we look at some of the really high-risk crime where we see kids, I’m talking babies very, very young, six months old and younger, who are in pay per view live online child sexual abuse streaming websites,” Walsh said, adding:

“That’s getting paid for by cryptocurrencies. We need to have some sort of options. We need to know how we try and challenge that threat and reduce the risks for kids and reduce the opportunities for criminals to get involved. And it’s gonna take lots of different brains. It’s going to take technologists, policymakers, philosophers, the whole nine yards.”

Bitcoin price must finish week above $9,533

Data from Coin360 painted a gloomy picture for day traders Thursday, BTC/USD having lost 8% in the past 24 hours.

The turbulence began late on Wednesday, Bitcoin markets shedding $500 in minutes to completely lose support at $10,000. Selling pressure then mounted, BTC/USD putting in a local low of $9,350 before stabilizing closer to $9,500.

As Cointelegraph reported, expectations had been mounting throughout the week that Bitcoin would break its sideways trading pattern to produce fresh volatility.

Those omens came true, albeit to the downside, as analysts admitted that the monthly outlook as well was now looking less than appetizing.

“Price is near weekly support & on weekly perspective, I want to see BTC close above $9533 Sunday or it would form a lower-low,” regular contributor Josh Rager summarized in his latest update.

“Monthly chart looks ugly too,” he added.

Not everyone was concerned by the drop, however. PlanB, the well-known cryptocurrency Twitter account, likened current conditions to Bitcoin in mid-2016, shortly before momentum built to take the cryptocurrency to its record high of $20,000.

That forecast would likely provide little comfort to traders who longed Bitcoin, however, with $150 million liquidated on derivatives giant BitMEX late Wednesday.

Altcoins face “oblivion,” says Keiser

Altcoins meanwhile felt the full force of the bears, with many tokens considerably outpacing Bitcoin in shedding value.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 8.8% to $170, a drop similar to most of the top twenty cryptocurrencies.

The action fuelled the existing lack of faith in altcoin markets, with RT host Max Keiser declaring ETH/USD could soon fall to just $90.

“Bitcoin dominance climbs as alt-season fails to materialize and alts resume downward trek to oblivion,” he summarized on Twitter.

Altcoin Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and its controversial spin-off Bitcoin SV (BSV) should additionally shed another 90% of their value, he claimed.

The overall cryptocurrency market cap took a $20 billion hit from the combined losses, currently sitting at $246 billion, with Bitcoin’s share at 69%.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-bitcoin-com-partners-with-resistance-the-next-gen-dex/,"PR: Bitcoin.com Partners with Resistance - the Next Gen DEX

The Financial Times (FT) reported on Aug. 30 that the asset manager is developing a platform that would tailor portfolios of cryptocurrency funds for institutional investors.

Weeding out the crypto hedge fund space

Elwood Asset Management CEO Bin Ren told the FT that the venture will aim to steer investors towards a selection of vetted crypto funds that have passed robust due diligence so that market participants can avoid the risks associated with the emerging sector.

Ren — who formerly served as chief investment officer at Brevan Howard’s Systematic Investment Group — said that screening of the sector had resulted in Elwood identifying up to 50 crypto hedge funds as “probably satisfy our due diligence.”

While details of the product remain to be finalized, the new fund could enable investors to determine input factors such as the level of risk they are willing to court, their expectations of returns, as well as liquidity terms. It will also measure the potential correlation of the tailored crypto hedge fund portfolio with the rest of their existing assets.

As the FT notes, Elwood’s bid to navigate institutional clients through the new investment landscape is informed by a recognition that many crypto investment vehicles still lack the traditional features of the traditional hedge fund industry.

Product could eventually have $1bn AUM

The report cites research jointly conducted by Elwood and Big Four auditor PwC this year that revealed that crypto hedge funds charge an average management fee of 1.72% plus a performance fee of 23.5% — well above the 1.41% 16.6% respective averages for the traditional hedge fund industry.

For its services, Elwood will apply its own fee on top of the fees that investors pay to access the underlying funds.

“I see this as a very big growth opportunity,” he told the FT, noting he expects the product could eventually manage over $1 billion in assets.

This March, Elwood had indicated it was planning to increase its cryptocurrency offerings as it announced the launch of a blockchain exchange-traded fund in partnership with Invesco.

Howard himself has a host of crypto investments under his belt, including in EOS developer Block.one and the ICE-owned digital assets platform Bakkt.",,https://www.coindesk.com/top-10-cryptocurrencies-now-trading-below-200-day-price-averages,"Bitcoin now stands alone in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value at CoinMarketCap, with the rest having fallen below a key long-term moving average.

The top 10 cryptocurrencies by market value, ether (ETH), XRP, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), binance coin (BNB), EOS, bitcoin SV (BSV) and stellar (XLM), have now all closed firmly beneath their 200-period moving average (MA) on the daily chart.

The event marks a period of greater selling momentum, confirming the majority of the bearish mood currently prevailing among investors. Most traders now have their funds locked up in bitcoin (BTC), as seen by its high dominance rating standing at 69.1 percent.

The majority of the top 10 altcoins had already been trending bearish below the 200-period MA for some time (as early as July) while bitcoin cash (BCH) completed the set passing beneath the average on August 28.

As it stands all major top 10 alternative currencies by total market capitalization are now below the key moving average with traders bracing the possibility for another violent sell-off.

The onus is now heavily on the bulls to recoup losses above the 200-period MA’s or risk reverting back to 2018’s market trend of significant long-term lower lows and lower highs.

Death cross

Deepening the possibility of a greater drawdown from its recent peak high at $146 on June 22, litecoin’s (LTC) death cross looms on the daily chart with the 50-period MA and the 200-period MA flirting for a cross.

When the short-term 50-period MA passes below the long-term 200-period MA it signals a death cross, a reliable predictor of some of the worst bear markets in traditional stocks and crypto alike.

The possibility is notable given that litecoin lead the crypto market recovery earlier this year, when traders bought up the crypto asset in anticipation of its reward halving. Still, despite the event that reduced the mining reward from 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC, the world’s fifth largest crypto by market value appears to be rallying the markets for another drop.

Malta-based crypto platform Binance is ready to engage with all regulators from day one as it prepares to roll out its Venus digital currencies. “If we want to launch Venus in a country, we’ll make sure it complies with the regulations,” the exchange’s co-founder He Yi said in an interview.

Binance announced last week it plans to seek partners to create so-called stable coins -- digital currencies that are pegged to traditional money and thus less volatile than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which fluctuate based on market dynamics. In an interview detailing the project, He said Venus drew inspiration from Facebook’s Libra in many ways -- but that the resistance from governments around the world to the social-media behemoth’s plan served as a cautionary tale.

Facebook hopes its new currency will be used for everyday transactions across the globe after it goes live as soon as next year under the governance of a broad set of partners from Visa Inc. to Uber Technologies Inc. and Spotify Technology SA. But since the release of its whitepaper in June, Libra has drawn wide-ranging regulatory scrutiny. The European Union has started an antitrust investigation, U.S. officials from President Donald Trump to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have questioned Libra and officials from places like India have expressed skepticism.

Binance also plans to form an independent association in charge of Venus, and use a basket of government-backed currencies and securities as its reserve. But He said the company will take a “more conservative” approach to push through the project, with a priority on regulatory compliance rather than technological developments.

Unlike Libra, Venus will focus on partnering with governments and companies in non-Western countries, He said. In a special shout-out to China, she called Venus a “Belt and Road version of Libra,” saying its geographic scope would roughly align with Beijing’s sprawling infrastructure initiative.

The emphasis on regulatory buy-in is yet another sign of Binance’s efforts to improve its relationship with governments. The crypto platform, established in 2017, has at times played a game of regulatory whac-a-mole -- for example, it quit markets including Japan and China to avoid clashes with local financial watchdogs. But more recently Binance has set up regulatory-compliant exchanges in friendlier jurisdictions like Singapore and Malta, allowing customers to trade using real money.

China, meanwhile, is planning to release its own cryptocurrency that would eventually replace cash in circulation and give Beijing even more control of its financial system. The country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has already shut down local crypto exchanges.

“So far regulators around the world can’t gauge precisely the potential risks stable coins will bring to their financial systems, and that’s why they are very careful about Libra-like currencies,” said Hu Tao, founder of Beijing-based crytpo researcher TokenInsight. “In theory, Binance will face the same challenges as Facebook.”

In the Chinese statement announcing Venus, Binance advises governments to launch a regulatory sandbox, which, among other things, allows private firms to issue their own stable coins for payments and cross-border settlements. “It’s better to embrace the change rather than missing the opportunity,” according to the statement written by He.

Binance will likely create a new open-sourced blockchain for Venus, He says, rather than using its own Binance Chain, which already supports a range of stable coins. The exchange operator is willing to give up some commercial interests to attract more partners, she said, although the plan hasn’t been finalized yet.

He is leading a team of more than 10 people in compliance, business development and coding to work on the Venus project. There’s no time line yet for the launch, but she expects more details including partnerships to be released in the next few months.

A TV anchor-turned tech entrepreneur, He launched Binance with “CZ” Zhao Changpeng after leaving Chinese crypto exchange OKCoin, which the two co-founded. Previously she also served as a vice-president of marketing for Beijing-based Yixia Technology, which owns a slew of popular short video apps.",2019-08-30 14:49:05.644,https://www.ccn.com/china-denies-forbes-crypto-launch-claim/,"

China is not launching a central bank-backed crypto in November, says China's state media outlet the Global Times. | Source: REUTERS / Dado Ruvic

China is not launching a central bank-backed crypto in November. That’s what Chinese state media outlet the Global Times said, in refuting a Forbes report.

Central bank calls report ‘inaccurate speculation’

On Twitter, the Global Times shot down a widely-circulated Forbes story. In a terse denial, the Times claims that China’s central bank dismissed the rumor as “inaccurate speculation.”

Neither the newspaper nor the People’s Bank of China (the nation’s central bank) elaborated. Forbes has not updated or retracted its story. That’s not surprising, since the post has garnered more than 84,000 page views so far.

That said, many readers view the Global Times with skepticism. It’s widely considered the propaganda arm of the Community Party of China.

Refuting media reports of launching a state-backed cryptocurrency in the coming months, #China's central bank termed them as ""inaccurate speculation."" pic.twitter.com/Sb4tQVPD3G — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) August 28, 2019

Source allegedly claimed launch could take place by Nov. 11

Not surprisingly, the dubious news of the alleged Chinese cryptocurrency launch thrilled bitcoin investors.

The Forbes story claimed that China’s central bank would unveil a state-backed digital currency and issue it to these seven institutions:

Bank of China

Industrial and Commercial Bank of China

Agricultural Bank of China

China Construction Bank

Alibaba

Tencent

Union Pay.

A financial researcher named Paul Schulte told Forbes that the launch could take place as early as November 11.

Schulte previously worked as global head of financial strategy at China Construction Bank. He gushed that his former employer was one of the institutions that the People’s Bank of China would distribute its digital currency to.

“China is barreling forward on reforms and rolling out the cryptocurrency,” Schulte claimed. “It will be the first central bank to do so.”

Previous Forbes crypto story debunked

Forbes claimed that the Chinese central bank wanted to roll out its own cryptocurrency to beat Facebook’s Libra to the punch.

However, it now seems that the Forbes report may have been wildly exaggerated, premature, or wrong. This is not the first time that Forbes has circulated a cryptocurrency story that was widely shared but later debunked.

In December 2018, Forbes breathlessly reported that KFC Venezuela had started accepting Dash payments. The crypto-sphere celebrated the news, saying it was another example of cryptocurrencies going mainstream.

However, the CEO of KFC Venezuela denied the Forbes report and apologized for the fake news.

China cracks down on bitcoin mining

The Chinese government has often taken a hostile stance toward cryptocurrencies. As CCN.com reported, China has cracked down on bitcoin mining amid recurring problems with scams and electricity theft.

In May 2019, Chinese authorities threw a 61-year-old grandmother in jail for four months for stealing electricity while mining bitcoin.

China Throws Bitcoin-Mining Grandma in Jail for Electricity Theft https://t.co/6GCU1NkIn0 — CCN – Capital & Celeb News (@CapitalAndCeleb) May 27, 2019

Many in the cryptocurrency industry were outraged that Chinese authorities insisted on prison for an old woman even though she paid her fines to the government and reimbursed the electricity company.

Moreover, the grandmother only earned a total of $940 from her bitcoin mining activities.

Facebook’s Libra languishes in crypto limbo

Meanwhile, Libra’s much-vaunted “cryptocurrency” is being stifled by opposition from all sides.

Right now, Libra is flailing in Crypto Purgatory, thanks to opposition from U.S. lawmakers like Congresswoman Maxine Waters.

Waters, who’s the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, is deeply skeptical of Libra and vehemently opposes it in principle.

Like fellow California Democrat Brad Sherman, Waters fears that cryptocurrencies could supplant the US dollar and facilitate money-laundering. “We just can’t allow [Facebook]…to compete with the dollar,” Waters said.",2019-08-30 15:30:02+00:00,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/rich-indians-more-likely-to-buy-bitcoin-think-cryptocurrencies-are-good-investments/1691331/,"With a majority of 30%, Bitcoin has more followers on its side than other currencies. (Reuters)

India’s wealthiest population is more likely to invest in a Bitcoin than other cryptocurrencies as the country’s high-net-worth individuals believe digital currencies are good investments. While real estate is the preferred investment asset for the super-rich in India, according to a Hurun India report, the Indian super-rich have also mulled making an investment in cryptocurrencies. About a tenth of the respondents surveyed by Hurun said that they will invest in digital currencies in the next three years, making it the fourth most preferred asset for investment in future after real estate, stock and fixed income.

However, with a majority of 30%, Bitcoin has more followers on its side than other currencies. Following Bitcoin, Indian HNIs are more inclined towards Ethereum and Ripple. Only about 6% of respondents said that they will invest in other cryptocurrencies. A whopping half of the Indian wealthy also said that they were not aware of what cryptocurrencies are. “Nearly half of the respondents said they don’t know much about virtual currency. Among those who were educated about it, mentioned their preference to invest in Bitcoin (29.15%); the next 8.74% prefer Ethereum and 6.80% would like to invest in Ripple,” Hurun report said. Recently, Facebook-fame Mark Zuckerberg had also announced a cryptocurrency by the name Libra, which is expected to be rolled out in 2020.

Previously, an inter-ministerial committee had said that the government must launch its own digital money. Cryptocurrencies have largely found criticism from investors and economists, globally. Many advanced economies have been trying to regulate digital currency and in some of them, cryptocurrencies are subject to money laundering laws and can also be taxed.",2019-08-30 16:17:25+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/japans-coincheck-crypto-exchange-reduces-leverage-by-20,"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has announced it is reducing the scope of its leveraged trading options to comply with local rules.

In a blog post on Aug. 30, officials said they were reducing the size of leverage available for margin traders from five times to four times.

Coincheck plans Oct. 31 changes

The move has come in direct response to best practices put forward by the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association — or JVCEA — the dedicated self-regulatory body for the Japanese exchange industry.

The changes should take effect from Oct. 31, the blog post says, Coincheck urging traders to cancel any scheduled margin calls and take certain precautions.

Exchange metamorphosis continues

Margin trading, as Cointelegraph has reported, involves a considerable amount of risk, and it has even been suggested the practice can move entire Bitcoin (BTC) market rates.

Nonetheless, the option continues to gain popularity, with new offerings hitting the market from players such as fellow exchange Binance this year.

Coincheck, which recovered from a giant $530 million hack in Jan. 2018, revealed last week it was considering launching a further spin-off for initial exchange offerings (IEOs).

Similar in essence to initial coin offerings —or ICOs — an IEO facilitates sales of crowdsale tokens directly by an exchange without the need for a middleman.

On Thursday, meanwhile, Japan’s financial regulator said it was considering expanding on existing exchange monitoring policies. The plans were reported by local cryptocurrency news outlet, Crypto Watch.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chainalysis-jesse-spiro-on-crypto-wallet-blocking-and-its-potential-impact,"More and more cryptocurrency addresses have been added to the United States Department of the Treasury’s list of Specially Designated Nationals, which are marked as being possibly associated with the global drug trade. According to the Kingpin Act, U.S. companies and individuals are banned from any type of commercial relationship with addresses on the list as well as people connected to them.

The three Bitcoin (BTC) addresses that recently came under a fire belong to Chinese citizens. Less than a week after Chainalysis rolled out a real-time suspicious transactions detector, its global head of policy, Jesse Spiro, shared his concerns about account blocking and the possible reaction of the crypto market.

Cointelegraph: It seems the three Chinese individuals have not been arrested. If in some way, by peer to peer transactions, their Bitcoin comes to my wallet and I exchange it into fiat at regulate exchanges, will my account be blocked?

Jesse Spiro: While we cannot predict how an exchange will treat your account as a whole. Most likely, they would block the transaction itself, pending investigation into its (and your) connection to the designated individual/address.

Unless you had multiple transactions — in both directions — with the identified address, it would be surprising for an exchange to block your account as a whole. Everyone recognizes that someone could send Bitcoin to another without the recipient ""agreeing"" to deal with that person.

However, the exchange would likely look for active engagements between you and the designated individual. If the transaction was merely ""in some way"" sent and not due to you engaging it, then the blocking of the single transaction would presumably not be a major issue for you.

CT: Is Bitcoin's fungibility not a concern here? Isn't it destroying the value of Bitcoin?

JS: Blocking specific Bitcoin involved in illicit activity does not destroy the value of Bitcoin. In the sanctions context, the BTC should be frozen until sanctions are lifted. In that case, the BTC would be explicitly untainted by the public removal of sanctions.

Overall, whether frozen or merely identified with problematic activity but still in circulation, the issue is less about fungibility and more about reasonableness in how far from and what the connection to criminal activity it’s a risk to be transacting (indirect exposure, etc.), like with fiat (digital or not) today.

It takes some investigation for an exchange to assess that risk of engagement with illicit activity (as financial institutions have done for decades with digital transfers), but that’s why Chainalysis helps conduct those assessments: to build trust in blockchains.

Like prior digital transfers and serial numbers, it does not necessarily mean that the Bitcoin is taken out of circulation (aside from being frozen, but then it is not a fungibility issue any more than seizing cash) or that connection to it is tainted forever — in the same way that serial numbers of cash traceable back to narcotics trafficking is not in itself enough evidence that you committed a crime. It is an indicator to look into possible connection to — and distance from — the illicit activity, but people are not convicted on serial numbers alone.

CT: If the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklists a lot more BTC addresses, how will that affect the price?

JS: There are many factors at play for BTC price impact. Price could theoretically go up if more BTC is frozen and taken off the market.

But theoretically, more indicators of BTC involvement in serious illicit activity could further the image of BTC as the “money of dark net operators and criminals,” which could reduce broader adoption — and in turn, the price.

However, active financial integrity in the ecosystem could also help counter the concern that crypto is a Wild West, with no way of telling if you’re dealing with someone profiting off of child exploitation. In that sense, transparency and an ability to assess the activity at play can help build trust in cryptocurrency, which is a significant part of the Chainalysis mission.

CT: How do you see the OFAC’s move on Bitcoin and other cryptos in near future?

JS: The OFAC, characteristically, moved lightly with its first identification of crypto addresses associated with the SamSam ransomware attacks, with limited connection to hosted enterprises. With this recent set of address identifications, touching hosted wallets, the OFAC has moved further into addresses that implicate broader commercial actors, and the complexities of implementation and mitigating collateral impact.

With the world increasingly — and incrementally — on notice that the OFAC is monitoring the use of cryptocurrency for sanctions-related conduct, we expect them to continue to identify more addresses and increase the comfort level of identifying addresses more closely connected to the broader ecosystem as the industry develops its own ability to implement and adhere to the sanctions with greater precision.

Nevertheless, such moves may potentially boost cryptocurrency’s transparency and that, in its turn, fosters greater trust in crypto as a means of exchange, according to Jesse Spiro.

The new platform is being developed mainly for institutional investors and will make investments in various crypto asset hedge funds. According to the Financial Times, the hedge fund will consist of several other funds, and is expected to manage around $1 billion in total client assets.

This crypto venture fund announcement has come during a bull run that’s mostly dominated by Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s leading digital currency. Recent data from Hedge Fund Research reveals that digital asset-focused investment portfolios are up around 60% over Q1 and Q2 2019.

Keeping Digital Assets Safe Can Be A Challenge

Elwood Asset Management, the company responsible for managing Howard’s personal cryptocurrency investments, will be handling the development, launch, and investment strategy of the new digital currency fund. The goal is to find companies that meet Elwood’s due diligence criteria, in order to ensure that clients’ assets remain safe.

Commenting on the potential risks of managing cryptos, Bin Ren, CEO, blockchain funds specialist at Elwood, said:

“Losing traditional assets in the real world is hard. In the digital world, it’s very easy to lose assets — put in the wrong address for a bitcoin transfer and it’s gone forever.”

Howard’s venture fund will aim to identify the appropriate investment companies who are interested in allocating capital while offering their own clients’ portfolio options that meet certain risk profiles, and liquidity and diversity requirements.

Details regarding the investments will be announced in the foreseeable future. Elwood’s management intends to create bespoke portfolios for each client. The investment firm will be charging an undisclosed management fee for its services, and a separate fee for accessing the underlying crypto funds.

Institutions Need More Options for Investing in Crypto Assets

Elwood and investment management firm Invesco had previously introduced an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in firms building various blockchain-based platforms.

During an interview with Bloomberg in March 2019, Ren remarked:

“The only way for institutions to get meaningful exposure to digital assets has been to buy Bitcoin, but many are reluctant or unable to buy Bitcoin — and for good reason.”

Howard has been investing in crypto assets since 2017. He also made a strategic investment in Block.one, a Cayman Islands-registered software publishing firm behind the development of EOS, one of the largest platforms for building decentralized applications (dApps).

Over the last two years, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network’s protocol and third-party infrastructure have grown in robust fashion. There are now more than 70 projects and applications built on and around the BCH chain. The following is an in-depth guide on how to benefit from the growing number of BCH-based projects and tools available today.

Progressive Development and Statistics

Just recently Bitcoin.com published a BCH resource page comprised of a vast number of tools and services available to Bitcoin Cash supporters. The list features more than 70 unique BCH projects and applications accessible at any time like games, social media, payment gateways, merchant services, and wallets. The BCH chain has a lot of third-party support, and protocol development shines as Bitcoin Cash continues to spread innovation. For instance, there are 8 Bitcoin Cash full node clients available including Bitcoin ABC, BCHD, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bcash, Flowee, Scash, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Verde. The BCH chain also has two programming languages including Spedn, and Cashscript.

According to Coin Dance BCH statistics, software engineers have completed 24 projects including increasing the block size to 32MB, enabling Schnorr signatures, re-introducing the Satoshi opcodes, adding OP_Checkdatasig, and Increasing the default datacarriersize to 220 bytes. Coin Dance is another great community-driven statistics and services website that can be found on the Bitcoin.com projects page. Alternatively, for statistics and other types of data perspectives, BCH fans can visit Coinsalad, Bitcoin Fees, TX Highway, and Txstreet.

Social Networks, Blogging, and Tipping

Bitcoin Cash also has a bunch of cool social networks where people can tip, earn, and record onchain data in unparalleled fashion. There’s the BCH social network and protocol Memo.cash and Honest Cash, for example. Then there’s the Memo extension Member Client and the Patreon-like Bitbacker platform. All of these applications allow BCH supporters to participate in discovering and supporting content creators using bitcoin cash for incentives.

Clients like Memo and Member use OP_Return transactions so arbitrary data can be stored on the BCH chain forever. Not only can users choose to tip BCH on these platforms they can also tip and crowdfund with applications like Tippr, Gitcash, Tip Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin.com Freedom Support, and Tips Monitor. Since these projects have been introduced BCH supporters have been tipping random folks to show the power of BCH, funding projects that bolster the advancement of liberty, and using social media applications that foster content creation.

Gaming

The BCH ecosystem has a wide variety of games and casino platforms as well, allowing people to wager funds in order to win more BCH. There’s cashgames.Bitcoin.com which offers a wide variety of games like slots, roulette, Satoshi circle, blackjack, video poker, dice, craps, and keno.

BCH users can also visit the oldest crypto gaming site online, Satoshidice, and other great gaming platforms like Satoshistack, Potodds.cash, Nakamoto Game, and Spinbch. With the Bitcoin Cash network deposits are instant, and because of the transparency of blockchain technology, games are provably fair. Many of the platforms like cashgames.Bitcoin.com exclusively use BCH and offer anonymous and instant registration. BCH-based games are fun and allow participants to win big jackpots by simply depositing small fractions of bitcoin cash.

Extending Bitcoin Cash Innovation

There are other types of software development that have cushioned the BCH chain with many benefits. People can now transact more privately using bitcoin cash with the shuffling app Cashshuffle. Individuals and organizations can now tokenize anything using the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP). Since the SLP launch last year thousands of unique tokens have been created on top of the BCH chain.

There’s also Bitbox Scaffold Websockets, CashID, Cash Accounts, and the Panda Suite. BCH participants can also utilize the Last Will and Mecenas plugins for inheritance and recurring payments. These platforms can be used with certain wallets like the Bitcoin.com Wallet, Electron Cash, Badger, Simple Wallet, Ifwallet, and Crescent Cash.

Moreover, with Cointext people can easily send BCH to their friends and family over an SMS messaging service to any mobile phone even without internet service. Users can also utilize the ultra-fast and privacy-centric Neutrino Wallet created by the BCHD team. There’s also Bitcoin Cash Notes for people interested in unique pre-loaded BCH paper wallets.

Payment Services, Merchant Directories, and Places to Spend BCH

The BCH ecosystem also has a variety of payment gateways and processors that help people spend and accept BCH for goods and services. For example, there are free merchant register applications from Bitcoin.com which are available for both Android and iOS devices. Then there’s Bitpay, Anypay Global, Coinbase Commerce, GoURL, Gateway Cash and Bchpls.io who also provide reliable payment services for merchants and people paying for products using bitcoin cash.

Additionally, people can easily find merchants that accept BCH using the Marco Coino platform that’s available for mobile devices and desktop browsers. Greenpages is a community-maintained bitcoin cash merchant directory as well. Of course, there’s Purse.io where users can save 15% or more on Amazon shopping with BCH. And there’s Bitcoin Rewards too, which gives you cashback incentives in BCH when you transact online. Just launched this week is the new Zeux app for Android and iOS which allows crypto proponents to pay with BCH via Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.

Working for Bitcoin Cash, Decentralized Shopping, and Bounties

There’s a multitude of ways people can earn BCH by using platforms like Openbazaar and Haven. Both applications allow users to shop with bitcoin cash in a private fashion. BCH fans can earn money using Lazyfox and Tewtew by creating content and solving tasks. To commemorate the Bitcoin Pizza day there’s Bchpizza.org, a website dedicated to BCH-accepting pizza shops and rewards. BCH Coffee is a similar platform and instead of pizza, the service offers rewards for people who get coffee shops onboard with BCH. Those looking for freelance work and who are willing to work for BCH can use the website Working For Bitcoins. People can also help with bounties via Bounty.cash, and go on real BCH treasure hunts with the geocaching game Findbitcoin.cash.

Peer-to-Peer Trading and Spreading Economic Freedom

We can’t forget to mention the launch of Local.Bitcoin.com, the peer-to-peer BCH marketplace. Local.Bitcoin.com is a game changer for cryptocurrency trading, global trade, and spreading economic freedom worldwide. There’s also platforms like Bitcoinfiles which allows people to pin data to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Bitcoin Cash blockchain. And there’s Sideshift too, which provides people with the ability to swap BCH and a wide range of other digital assets instantly. There are so many BCH applications and projects that fill our BCH resource page and there’s still a bunch more bitcoin cash apps in the works. Bitcoin Cash supporters believe the future is bright in regard to the potential BCH has to offer the world, and passionate fans are relentlessly spreading the gospel of the decentralized currency’s variety of attributes.

The analyst said that unlike Bitcoin, Litecoin’s price doesn’t have a significant relationship with the stock-to-flow ratio, which makes its halvings less relevant to its price.

Litecoin halvings have very little effect on its price

With the halving of Bitcoin slowly approaching, many cryptocurrency analysts and experts have voiced their opinions on how the quadrennial event will affect the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. While most Bitcoin maximalists believe the reduced supply left after the halving will only increase demand due to the coin’s scarcity, there was a strong current of skeptics that claimed the halving would be detrimental to its growth.

The example of Litecoin was used to illustrate this. As the coin experienced its second halving on Aug. 5 and its price remained unchanged, many said that Bitcoin’s own halving would also have very little effect on its price.

However, prominent Twitter cryptocurrency analyst PlanB claims this logic is flawed and offered an interesting comparison between Bitcoin and Litecoin to show that BTC’s halving would have a significantly different outcome.

Some people think that because litecoin didn't jump on ltc halving, btc halving will also be irrelevant for #bitcoin. That logic is flawed. LTC price doesn't have a significant relationship with stock to flow, so halvings are indeed irrelevant. BTC price-s2f relation is strong 🚀 https://t.co/5Wx7vHLvUd — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) August 31, 2019

The analyst pointed out that unlike Bitcoin, Litecoin’s price doesn’t have a significant relationship with its stock-to-flow ratio. Stock-to-flow is the total amount of a commodity that is held in inventories, divided by the amount produced annually.

Stock-to-flow ratio shows a bleak future for Litecoin

When speaking of cryptocurrencies, stock-to-flow is calculated when the total number of coins in circulation is divided by the number of coins created in one month, and then divided by 12. The value is used to calculate how many years are needed to produce all the coins currently in circulation, with the higher number indicating a higher scarcity.

According to a series of tweets by PlanB, Bitcoin has a strong stock-to-flow ratio. Apart from that, Bitcoin also has a strong relationship with the predicted stock-to-flow value. The analyst said that the 2012 stock-to-flow model is still “working fine” and will continue for some years to come.

Bitcoin only needed 4 years of data to pick up and model the stock to flow signal. That 2012 model is still working fine (out of sample) until this very moment, and probably for some years to come. pic.twitter.com/xY6y9CYKcI — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) August 31, 2019

Litecoin, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have any relationship with the stock-to-flow ratio, the analyst pointed out.

Per request and despite the fact that I think that alts theoretically don't have 'unforgeable costliness' .. I decided to make a #Litecoin #LTC stock-to-flow model (data from Sep 2013). R2 is low .. 25%. Current S2F value is $27 (after 2019 halving $65). Can somebody pls verify?! pic.twitter.com/3RmjaELKv0 — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) June 8, 2019

While he said he wasn’t sure why this was the case with Litecoin, several theories popped up during the Twitter discussion. PlanB said that the lack of network effects such as on/off ramps, futures, options, and liquidity could be what caused Litecoin’s value to remain stable even after the halving.

Others said reduced block rewards combined with lower prices pre-halving caused Litecoin miners to leave en masse. The lack of profitability means less network use, and the only supporters that remain are hodlers that don’t cause massive price fluctuations.

Miners are leaving LTC as block rewards halved while price remains even lower then it was pre halving. LTC miners collected a paltry $671 in mining fees over the past 24 hours. It simple isn't profitable to do business w/ LTC anymore. Remaining supporters are bag holders. pic.twitter.com/nS0o0x9Azl — WhiteRabbit (@WhiteRabbitBTC) August 31, 2019

Whatever the case is, many members of the crypto community seem to have lost their faith in Litecoin. While the halving might not have affected its price, Litecoin will have a tough time protecting itself from the lack of support in the industry.

This comes in response to how he perceives Ripple to be “dumping” billions worth of XRP. He believes this supposed dumping is collapsing the price of XRP tokens.

Crypto Bitlord began by taken offense over alleged XRP “dumping” practices

The crypto investor in question is a cryptocurrency trader known under the pseudonym “Crypto Bitlord”. Moreover, Crypto Bitlord has a substantial following on Twitter, with more than 100,000 followers.

Crypto Bitlord has previously been a vocal supporter of Ripple’s XRP token. As such, he has been held in high esteem within the greater “XRP Army” Ripple community.

Nevertheless, it would seem that the investor has now shifted views on XRP quite substantially. Earlier in August, Crypto Bitlord started a petition on change.org. This petition aims to persuade Ripple into stop “dumping” large amounts of XRP, which Crypto Bitlord argues is crashing XRP’s price.

Instead, Crypto Bitlord notes that the XRP community could instead increase XRP’s price. In the petition, which has around 3,000 signatures, argues XRP supporters should pump the crypto’s price.

Crypto Bitlord is now threatening to fork XRP

With this said, however, it seems Crypto Bitlord wants to take even more dramatic action. He is now threatening to fork XRP. This would be a way for Crypto Bitlord to seize control over Ripple’s token from Ripple itself.

Crypto Bitlord notes that this would allow the XRP community to disregard Ripple’s whims, wishes and overarching strategy. “I’m thinking about forking XRP so we don’t have to deal with the founders dumping. This will be a community effort.”

However, following this statement Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, took to Twitter to address this threat. According to Garlinghouse, XRP sales are necessary and revolve around “helping expand XRP’s utility.”

Nonetheless, Crypto Bitlord did not accept this response. Instead, he wrote that Ripple now only has 60 days to stop dumping XRP. If Ripple does not comply and stop “dumping” the cryptocurrency, Crypto Bitlord threatens to stage a “community takeover”.

This has only made things even worse, according to reports. Crypto Bitlord claims to have even received death threats over the proposed community fork. On the other hand, it is unclear whether Crypto Bitlord’s claims are true or not.

No matter what, any XRP supporter will do well to follow this story and see whether Crypto Bitlord indeed takes control in less than 60 days.

Telegram is not the first messaging app company to be offering a token. Alongside the announcement of Gram, was Kik’s announcement of their own crypto, known as Kin, to much controversy.

Unlike Kin, Gram seems to be moving full steam ahead.

After October 31st, Telegram is required to issue refunds to investors in its token sale, as stated in the user agreement. The messaging service raised over $1.7 billion in 2018 for the project.

As part of the crypto project, a startup has been created by investors in Gram, known as TON Labs. The company is responsible for building developer tools that will facilitate building upon the new network. As TON Labs CEO and managing partner Alexander Filatov told CoinDesk, included in those tools with be a Solidity compiler, which will enable decentralized apps built on Ethereum to also run on TON.

Filatov elaborated on the endeavor:

That was probably the most difficult thing we built. It will allow the advanced Ethereum community to pull everything they wrote for ethereum into TON.

Filatov added that the Solidity compiler has been in testing since July. In fact, the upcoming code release on Sunday will be paramount to the success of Gram:

We have very little time between the node release and the mainnet launch to test, identify and fix possibly bugs and vulnerabilities.

Earlier this year, Telegram shared code with investors, which was promptly leaked to the public. The code allowed moderate tinkering with the blockchain’s anticipated functions:

You can play with GRAMs, write a simple smart contract talking to the node via a light client [and] create a wallet.

If all goes well, the release on Sunday should be the last in a series of code releases by the company.",2019-08-31 09:55:37+03:00,https://decrypt.co/8841/brazil-cielo-payment-processor-pos-bitcoin,"Brazil’s biggest payment processor, Cielo, has unveiled support for cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, on its 1.4 million point-of-sale devices throughout the country.

The news was unveiled at the annual Blockmaster cryptocurrency conference, reports Cointelegraph Brasil.

Users will be able to send crypto to devices via a QR code–users will need an account with Uzzo or Criptohub, Cielo’s network partners. From October, the company is planning to go one step further and accept crypto payments without the need for a point-of-sale device.

As per the report, a mobile app, CieloPay, would be used to generate the QR code instead. The app, launching on October 14, will enable remote payments through applications such as WhatsApp and online stores.

Cielo president Paulo Caffarelli said that the company’s banking partners, Banco do Brasil and Bradesco Bradesco, are backing the new crypto payments offering.

That could be because the competition to introduce crypto payment services independent of point-of-sale is hotting up in Brazil. Earlier this month, Banco Inter, one of the first banks in Brazil to go digital, announced, on Instagram, that it is launching a new card payment method. The system will dispense with the need for a point-of sale device, and would also allow payment with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

In Brazil then, crypto payments are all set to become as easy as pie.",2019-08-31 17:00:30,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-china-trade-war-and-its-effect-on-cryptocurrencies,"The People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country’s central bank, has announced that it is planning to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC), inspired in part by Facebook’s Libra project.

David Marcus, the head of Facebook cryptocurrency wallet Calibra, and known as the co-creator of the company’s venture into cryptocurrencies, had this to say on Twitter:

“Like I said: if we don't lead (and by ‘we’ I mean the Free World, *not FB*) others will. It wasn't a figure of speech, an exaggeration, or a spin of the reality we face. It was the truth.”

In the shadow of United States President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, we are beginning to see the battle lines drawn in a war for global monetary supremacy, with China’s offering representing centralized control and including the suppression of foreign influences. Marcus’s tweet clearly alluded to this clash of East vs. West — but it’s notable that he is taking aim at U.S. regulators and Congress — in particular, the House Financial Services Committee, which is chaired by Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters — to espouse a contrasting regulatory approach based on capitalism, freedom and less central regulation.

China, the great “centralizer”

China has historically suppressed technologies controlled by outsiders in favor of those under its own influence, and the “Great Firewall of China” has been used to suppress social media sites like Twitter, search engines like Google and messengers like WhatsApp, as well as to promote homegrown alternatives like Sina Weibo, Baidu and WeChat respectively.

As such, foreign cryptocurrencies have been similarly suppressed in China. Back in 2018, China issued a ban on any and all crypto activities, including all access to international exchange platforms. And according to Zhou Xiaochuan — the ex-governor of the People’s Bank of China — local financial institutions have been instructed by regulators that digital currencies should not be recognized as tools for retail payments.

Thus, close observers of China should not be surprised to see the PBoC launching its own homegrown CBDC initiative despite government bans. It would be consistent with past technology policies for foreign cryptocurrency projects to be suppressed in favor of this upcoming PBoC coin, and it would also be consistent for this project to be highly centralized.

The government of China has had a tremendous history of benefitting from the power of centralization — but it also has a deep understanding of what a revolution looks like and where it can come from. As such, it has been quick to nip cryptographic assets in the regulatory bud.

While China is expected to launch a single, centralized, monolithic digital currency and suppress all others, the West is expected to launch a plethora of initiatives — both for retail payment and remittances, such as Facebook’s Libra and Telegram’s TON, but also business-to-business, or B2B, examples such as JPM Coin and Signature Bank’s digital payments platform called Signet.

The battle for stability

One of the biggest criticisms to date of cryptocurrencies for payments is their volatility, which is illustrated most strikingly by the story of Lazlo Hanyecz (who paid 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of Papa John’s pizzas in the early days of Bitcoin). Another major criticism is the uncertain regulatory status, especially in regard to the status of cryptographic assets as a security in the eyes of regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

If a cryptographic asset were to maintain a stable value, it would be hard for the SEC to view it as a security, which requires that buyers expect appreciation in the value of securities. This emboldens compliant players such as Facebook or large banking institutions, which have everything to lose from any compliance irregularities.

Payments, the killer application

Because of the regulatory certainty and usability of so-called “stablecoins,” consumer-facing payments would be a killer application for regulated financial services on blockchain.

Payments will generally have two kinds of suppliers: banks and messengers. The banks will be the suppliers of interbank and enterprise payment networks — e.g., the People’s Bank of China coin, JPM Coin or Signature Bank’s Signet project).

The second kind of supplier will be the dominant provider for consumer payments, including peer-to-peer (P2P), e-commerce, in-game, point-of-sale and international remittance applications — namely, mobile messenger apps. The biggest in this category is, of course, Facebook’s Libra project.

But Libra is not alone in this space — South Korea’s messenger Kakao has launched a similar project based on a public blockchain called Klaytn. Telegram (which raised $1.7 billion) is launching TON, which is tied to its messenger that claims over 200 million users. And in the Japanese market, the dominant messenger, Line, has partnered with Visa and promises to bring its user base of over 200 million users onto the blockchain.

The use of a mobile messenger as a consumer payments platform is already a proven application in China, where WeChat Pay and AliPay are the dominant payment providers (neither of which currently use a blockchain-based cryptographic asset). The S&P recently conducted a survey that found 90% of adult internet users in China use WeChat Pay, 94% use Alipay and 86% use both. This duopoly also becomes a factor in the global payments clash between East and West.

The PBoC is rumored to be working with eight institutions that will be the first beneficiaries of the new currency — including Alibaba, Tencent, China Construction Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, Chinese banking association Union Pay and an eighth beneficiary that has yet to be named.

With the huge potential of users coming from messengers, logical payment applications include P2P payments (especially since messengers come with user identities, prebuilt social graphs and communities, trusted friends and family networks, and the ability to communicate about or request payments), in-game payments (as game economies include virtual goods and become a natural target because mobile apps are a natural environment to deliver virtual goods), online services (including music and online content subscriptions), e-commerce (which may come later due to the need for real-world delivery of goods) and remittances.

Why “stablecoin” is a bad name

First of all, stability is a feature rather than a category. Generally speaking, most stablecoins belong to the category of asset-backed tokens. In most cases, the assets are held in a reserve, and if the market value of the coin were to drop, the reserve assets are used to buy back the coin until it regains the target price level.

Similarly, more coins can be released from a reserve if the demand for the coin warrants. A reserve ratio determines how much of an asset is needed in order to support the stability of the price of a coin. Obviously, a 100% (or greater) reserve ratio should preserve a 1:1 ratio of the coin to the underlying asset, thereby theoretically allowing a coin to maintain stability.

The reason why “stablecoin” is a bad name is that there are literally no assets in history that have been known to exhibit a stable value over time — they are only stable relative to the value of another asset. Because of this, there isn’t any universal way to establish a stable threshold of value that is long-lasting.

Another optional property of a stablecoin is redeemability — which means any holder of the circulating asset can, at any time, redeem the circulating asset for the asset in the reserve. The U.S. dollar, for example, isn’t itself stable over time, as the purchasing power of USD has dropped by 95% since 1913.

This decline accelerated in 1971, when the dollar ceased to be backed by gold and silver. Because of this, a cryptographic asset tied to the price of the U.S. dollar (or any other asset) should not be considered a “stable” coin but rather a “pegged coin” — meaning that its value is pegged to the value of something else.

Therefore, a stablecoin can only be less stable that the underlying asset, never more. This is why Facebook has opted to use a trick adopted by central banks, which is to hold a basket of relatively stable assets — typically other national currencies — which reduces the risk exposure to single currencies.

Another reason why “stablecoin” is a misnomer is that stablecoins aren’t even stable relative to the underlying asset — they are typically subject to small fluctuations that are either regulated by the central bank controlling the money supply or by arbitrage traders who expect the central bank to restore the pegged value.

But the biggest reason why “stablecoin” is a terrible name for any cryptographic asset is that it’s typical for any pegged, centrally banked asset to be relatively stable vs. the underlying asset — until it’s not. A pegged asset like a currency can lose its peg, which generally results in devaluation of the currency — typically because the reserve is insufficient to buy the value of the currency back up to the pegged level.

In general, schemes that maintain a high reserve ratio maintain a basket of reserve assets, don’t expose themselves to market speculators and offer redeemability have the highest chance of maintaining their value.

Where it would lead

With the announcement of Libra by Facebook, every player in the game no longer has to guess what the table stakes are, and it’s time for the players to put their antes in. The People’s Bank of China reportedly added nongovernmental organizations to its network. “Inspired by Libra” and by the work South Korea’s Klaytn is doing with its governance council, the PBoC has certainly mirrored what Facebook has done with the Libra Foundation.

With billions of messenger users and bank customers being introduced to blockchain-based payment solutions, we can be sure that every major organization in the world will have to craft a response to this unprecedented situation. And the competition between nations and ideologies — such as China vs. the West — can actively accelerate the delivery of solutions that will form the basis for mass adoption of cryptographic assets.

The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter focused on crypto assets. Sign up here. For a primer on crypto custody concepts, you can download our free report here.

The crypto asset sector is notorious for its confusing use of vocabulary. Seriously, in what sense is a sequence of code a “coin”? And in the real world, “wallets” contain things, not intangible addresses.

The same can be said of the word “custody.” A complicated word at best, the traditional common law definition is being applied to crypto assets, with the result that most investors believe it means the same thing: the authorized safekeeping of property rights. It doesn’t.

This confusion is even more damaging than other misconceptions, as custody is not only an integral part of the security of an investor’s holdings; it is also a fundamental aspect of the emerging regulatory framework.

What’s more, the confusion is being overlaid onto an already baffling web of protections around the concept of asset custody, which highlights the colossal complication of establishing uniform rules and expectations.

Solutions that employ best practices are emerging, which should reassure institutional investors interested in crypto assets; but without greater clarity on what we’re even talking about, it is unlikely that a coherent framework will emerge in the short term, adding a further layer of risk onto a compelling alternative investment.

C is for custody

First, let’s look at the official definition of the word: oh wait, there isn’t one.

“Custody” is not a legal “term of art,” which means that it does not have a specific definition. The term could refer to a legal relationship, or it could be used generically to imply the holding of an asset. Treatment of the concept differs between and even within states, and federal application is often different again. “Custody” can imply transference of ownership, or merely third-party authorization, and does not always come with the guarantee of protection in case of custodian default.

Confusingly, we all tend to think we understand what custody means, but we don’t. Even official agencies often apply the term inconsistently.

One aspect most seem to agree on, however, is that “custody” implies the “holding” of something. In a 2003 amendment to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (just one of many official bodies that oversee custody of investment assets) attempted a formal definition:

“An adviser has custody of client assets… when it holds, ‘directly or indirectly, client funds or securities or [has] any authority to obtain possession of them.’”

But this still falls short of specifying what custody is.

By focusing on the word “holds,” we can start to glimpse how crypto assets can send this definition – and all others that rely on the pillars of “ownership” and “trust” – into a spin.

C is for complication

For the purposes of this conversation, we’ll be focusing on bitcoin; it currently dominates the crypto asset market and serves as the gateway for most investors given its relative liquidity and variety of on-ramps.

Ownership of traditional assets tends to rely on ledger entries. On some computer somewhere, you are listed as the owner of a certain asset. It doesn’t matter who holds that database – only you are the owner.

Bitcoin, however, is a bearer asset, and as such, has no names attached. Instead, bitcoins are associated with addresses, which in turn are associated with “wallets.” The assets themselves don’t live in the wallets, nor in a a central depository, nor in the account of the issuer; they live on the bitcoin blockchain, a decentralized global network with no identifiable accountability.

Whoever holds the private key to those wallets “owns” the bitcoin, in that he or she has the exclusive right to move them. Again, no names or proofs of ownership are necessary – the possession of the private key is enough.

So, how do you confer “custody” without handing over, or sharing, the private key? But if you hand over the private key, you effectively hand over ownership.

If a custodian has equal access to the code that can move your bitcoin, it has as much ownership as you do. Custody is generally understood to be about holding something of yours, on your behalf.

C is for consent

“Multisig” options protect your bitcoin to the extent that more than one private key signature is needed for a transaction – but that also implies a sacrifice of ownership. Your custodian could not move your bitcoin without your consent, but nor could you move it without your custodian’s consent.

Sure, a custodian can commit by contract to recognizing that, although they hold the asset, they recognize that it is really yours.

But then trust comes into the equation. What if the custodian disappears? In theory, traditional securities can be returned to their rightful owners in case of custodian default. With bitcoin, there’s little reassurance that will happen, especially since regulatory protections are scant.

Part of the reason is that globally accepted standards do not yet exist. Associations such as GDF are drafting “best practices” in collaboration with industry participants, but getting agreement on the detail and the application will take time.

C is for consumer

In an attempt to add clarity, in July the SEC and FINRA issued a joint statement highlighting concerns about the custody of digital securities by broker-dealers. They pointed out that the application of the Customer Protection Rule, which protects a client’s holdings in the event of a broker-dealer collapse, is unlikely to apply in the case of crypto assets.

Even if a holder “shares” private keys with a custodian, how does the custodian know that others don’t also have access? With this possibility, how can it ensure safekeeping? How can it be certain that the client’s access point can’t be compromised? The inability to reverse or correct transactions may be one of bitcoin’s value propositions for holders, but it is a significant concern for custodians and regulators.

The statement goes even further in highlighting the barriers of disjointed definitions: a failed broker-dealer would be liquidated in accordance with the Securities Investor Protection Act, which has a different understanding of the term “security” than that of the SEC. This leaves broker-dealer clients who have invested in crypto assets without protection, which the SEC is understandably uncomfortable with.

Obviously, any clarity at all is better than none, but the statement is limited in that it refers to digital securities held by broker-dealers – according to most regulators, bitcoin is not a “security,” and many bitcoin holders bypass broker-dealers by buying directly on exchanges. It does, however, underline the concern at regulatory level about the lack of understanding and standardization.

C is for challenge

So, being a “custodian” for bitcoin is a totally different proposition from being a custodian for traditional assets. And yet we persist in using the same word.

This makes it harder for newcomers to the sector to get their heads around the nature of this new asset class. It also makes it even harder for regulators to establish a coherent framework, when the standard understanding of “ownership” and “liability,” fundamental pillars of the custody concept, crumble under the crypto lens.

Symbolic words such as “coin” and “wallet” have good intentions – they give us a frame of reference. But in the case of “custody,” the misplaced metaphor adds to confusion more than it subtracts.

Throughout history, the development of technology has easily outstripped the emergence of a vocabulary that fits the new concepts. Metaphors are employed to facilitate comprehension, and they usually work. Often the expropriated words change in meaning thanks to their new applications (what do “web” and “net” mean to you today?).

But sometimes the semiotics encroaches onto areas where vocabulary needs to be specific in order to have impact: that of law. The use of the term “custody” to refer to the authorized safekeeping of private keys, and “custodian” to refer to the provider of this service – areas which call for the comfort of regulatory protection – are prime examples.

Coming up with a new term might help, and might even set a precedent on how establishing specific definitions to use across jurisdictions and mandates could facilitate and strengthen oversight. But a systemic barrier is the fragmented nature of financial regulation in the U.S. and elsewhere – who would decide on that new term and its definition?

Not all barriers are insurmountable, however – and with so much at stake, coordination could perhaps be achieved. Meanwhile, the sector continues to mature.

In the case of bitcoin and similar crypto assets, the problem is not so much that crypto custody is so different from traditional security custody – it’s that we’re trying to fit a new concept into an old box that doesn’t have the same dimensions.

Vault door image via Shutterstock",2019-08-31 11:10:07+00:00,https://coinrivet.com/what-should-i-be-buying-with-my-crypto/,"These days, we are constantly advised on the advantages of cryptocurrency as a form of payment – low transaction fees, increased security and an inclusive outlook – and how it will transform the industry for merchants and users alike. But where can we actually spend crypto and what should we be spending it on? Is it not better to hold on to it?

The potentially massive swings in cryptocurrency value might leave some reticent at the idea of buying, spending, or investing in this novel form of money. But really, at the end of the day, it’s still money and a way of exchanging value – an idea that has been around for centuries; long before traditional tender was invented.

Indeed, using cryptocurrencies can be considered an even more secure way to make purchases, particularly online, with cryptocurrency payment platforms offering buyer protection and lower, more transparent fees for both buyers and sellers. With this in mind, we’ve rounded up some ideas for your next purchase with cryptocurrency.

1) Electronics

Whether it’s out of necessity due to an appliance breaking, or a desire to possess the latest smartphone, electronics purchases are often at the forefront of our spending. In Europe alone, €56 million was spent on consumer electronics in 2018. It seems pretty logical to use technology to purchase technology and with platforms like Newegg and Phone House now accepting cryptocurrency payments, you can treat yourself to that new laptop you’ve been coveting or replace the washing machine that recently clunked out.

2) Travel

When it comes to booking a holiday, we all want the most elegant accommodation and most convenient flight itinerary at the most budget-friendly price possible. This often leads to us purchasing the best deals we find from third-party vendors and not from an airline or hotel directly. This in itself isn’t a problem, but fraud certainly is.

Not all third-party vendors are to be trusted and sadly, the tourism industry is no stranger to scams. This is why making holiday plans using crypto is a great idea; you can avoid risks with buyer-protected payment platforms that mediate on your behalf if you are scammed by a fraudulent travel company. A number of travel sites now accept major coins when it comes to booking flights (AirBaltic,SurfAir), hotels (CryptoCribs, GoEureka) and car rentals (EZ Rent-A-Car). Cheapair and Bitcoin.Travel are just some of the full-scope travel agents now accepting cryptocurrencies.

3) Sports merchandise and match tickets

Sport unites many from different countries through shared affiliations to specific sports clubs and sporting heroes, just like crypto transcends borders and brings together like-minded people with a common interest. Using crypto to buy sports merchandise and match tickets is becoming increasingly available, with clubs such as Portugal’s Benfica F.C. now accepting cryptocurrency payments on their website. Making match tickets and club merchandise available for purchase using cryptocurrency means that a fan in, say, South America, can buy an authentic jersey from the European club that they support without facing high currency conversion rates and fees.

4) Fashion and beauty

According to Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics industry accounted for €77.6 billion in 2017. There’s no denying the amount of time and money we spend on fashion and beauty, so why not start using our crypto to make these purchases? Platforms like Lolli even allow you to earn Bitcoin for free as you spend on glamorous brands including Sephora, Lululemon and Bloomingdale’s.

5) Gaming

The gaming industry is one never to be underestimated, with dedicated gamers residing all over the globe. These internationally dispersed gamers can now come together not only while playing online but also in how they buy their gaming essentials. With companies such as Microsoft accepting Bitcoin for its online Windows and Xbox stores, gaming is another way to spend your cryptocurrency and make the once fantastical idea of using decentralised digital currencies a reality.

‘Hodling’ (holding onto your crypto in the hope that it will increase in value) is also an option, and one that many would advocate for at this point in time. It’s true that cryptocurrencies are still volatile but with the fluctuations in geopolitics we’re currently witnessing, traditional fiat currencies such as the British pound, the Argentine peso, and the US dollar are also showing a degree of movement and unpredictability. So to this we say, why not embrace a new universal way of spending money by making everyday purchases using the currencies of inclusion?
