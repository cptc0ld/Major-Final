The world’s largest crypto derivatives exchange Bitmex has accidentally doxed tens of thousands of its users. An email newsletter concerning forthcoming updates to Bitmex indices CC’d a large proportion of the company’s mailing list, exposing the addresses of its users to the public. In a second embarrassment, Bitmex had its Twitter account hacked shortly afterward.

Bitmex Suffers a Day of Reckoning

It’s been a rough 24 hours for derivatives exchanges. Shortly before Bitmex CC’d in its mailing list, Deribit was forced to reimburse traders who were liquidated due to an error in its price index. Bitmex users are now being urged to change their details, with hackers and phishers certain to try and crack the leaked email addresses, many of which are likely to be tied to accounts on different crypto exchanges. The leaked and then aggregated Bitmex database is now up for sale on the darknet.

Deribit will reimburse over $1.3 million in losses from the BTC index calculation data issue around 21:00:00 UTC on October 31, 2019. The Deribit Insurance fund will not be used to cover these losses, but compensation will be covered by Deribit. — Deribit (@DeribitExchange) October 31, 2019

Exchanges such as Binance have already advised their users to modify email addresses if they were also linked to Bitmex. The blunder is a stark reminder to traders to use a unique email address and password for each platform, utilizing a password manager if needed.

The PR disaster was compounded when Bitmex’s official Twitter handle was briefly compromised, with tweets reading “Hacked” and “Take your BTC and run. Last day for withdrawals.”

In a statement, Bitmex cited a software error as the cause of the email breach, and stressed that, beyond email addresses, “no other personal data or account information have been disclosed and no further emails have been sent.” The statement also urged users to add official Bitmex email addresses to their contact lists and ensure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all their accounts.

Tens of Thousands of Addresses Exposed

Bitmex deputy COO Vivien Khoo said that while the email was sent to the majority of Bitmex users, not all were affected. According to skew.com, the exchange – which operates out of Seychelles – has 22,000 average daily users. Larry Cermak said on Twitter that “30,000 unique emails in total” were jeopardized.

In the aftermath of the leak, Twitter was aflame with panicked users, some enquiring how to delete their Bitmex account and others claiming to have already received crypto spam emails. There was further anger when it emerged that Bitmex requires users to undergo full KYC, including a selfie with their ID and the word “Bitmex,” in order to change their email address.

The email breach does not come at a good time for Bitmex, which is reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over whether it permits U.S. traders to use its platform. Armed with thousands of user email addresses, the CFTC may well step up its investigation.

The reputational and regulatory cost of the blunder is still to be counted. In the interim, neglecting to use blind copy on a mass email has given Bitmex and its normally ebullient CEO Arthur Hayes pause for thought.

According to Skew Markets, Bitcoin has been more volatile than other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum in the past week, which does not tend to happen due to the discrepancy in liquidity between BTC and alternative cryptocurrencies. The volatility of Bitcoin’s marked increase following a six-month low indicates that investors remain divided on the potential short-term trend of Bitcoin.

Given the stability of Bitcoin subsequent to achieving $10,600 in late October, some technical analysts favor a bullish scenario in which the Bitcoin price avoids a re-entry into the mid-$8,000 support level and looks to break out above $10,000. However, other traders still anticipate a deeper pullback, considering the entire run up to $10,600 to be a stop hunt, trapping long contracts across margin trading platforms and futures markets.

The bull scenario: clean recovery over $10,000 for Bitcoin

On Nov. 1, the highly anticipated monthly candle of Bitcoin is set to open at previous monthly candle openings, as the Bitcoin price has tended to record a large spike in value. After the opening of the monthly candle of August, the Bitcoin price went on to increase by more than $1,000, going from $10,000 to just over $12,200 over the following seven days. A similar trend also took place in September.

Based on historical data that shows a significant spike in volatility before and after the closure of a monthly candle, traders are anticipating that the Bitcoin price might test the $10,000 resistance level once again in the short term, TurtouseTraiding said on twitter:

“BTC Tomorrow is the day where the relative time period to the 2018 bottom ends. We already had a massive rise in price but bulls aren't out of the woods yet. Tomorrow is also the monthly close. Expecting a big move on BTC.”

Josh Rager, cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, similarly said that if the Bitcoin price is able to reclaim the mid-$9,000 region, it will likely lead the dominant cryptocurrency back above the $10,000 mark, an area considered as an important psychological level by investors, “Daily support below, while overhead is the weekly and monthly open (resistance) with a break and close above these areas on higher time frames will likely be a signal to move up in the $10ks.”

Scott Melker, a trader at Texas West Capital, described the current price action of Bitcoin as a largely bullish trend, based on its rebound from sub-$9,000, “This looks massively bullish to me. Price has broken out of the descending channel and is consolidating with the former resistance as support. Still long from $8.985.”

One potential positive factor for Bitcoin that could contribute to a short-term trend reversal to the upside is the increase in the daily volume of BTC on BitMEX, the most widely utilized cryptocurrency margin trading platform. BitMEX liquidations for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies in the past year reached $21 billion:

Throughout October, when the Bitcoin price portrayed signs of stagnation with a low level of volatility, the asset’s trading volume on BitMEX was hovering at around $1 billion to $1.5 billion, near to the levels seen in March 2019. The daily trading volume of Bitcoin then dropped below $1 billion on Oct. 12, down substantially since June when Bitcoin price hit a yearly high at $13,920.

Bitcoin’s trading volume on BitMEX is an important indicator for trading sentiment, as the exchange tends to see a mass cascade of long or short liquidations that trigger a big price movement to either the upside or downside.

The bear scenario: a bigger pullback based on fractal

A technical analyst and trader known to the cryptocurrency community as “Dave the Wave” has long emphasized the bear trend of Bitcoin since mid-2019, ever since the asset started to fall off from its spike to $13,920.

If the Bitcoin price is following a fractal, the analyst said that a drop to the $6,000–$7,000 range is likely in the short to medium term, adding that BTC has fallen back into the downside trend after its rise to $10,600. The analyst also noted that it is difficult for a two-day spike to dismantle months of BTC’s price action, suggesting that the abrupt surge to over $10,000 on Oct. 26 has not changed the course of the asset, adding:

“Was always unlikely for a multi-month trend to be broken on the basis of a two day spike. Has retraced near 50% already.”

Rager also explained that for the bullish structure of Bitcoin to hold, it will need to defend the $9,000 support level with strength and avoid a drop below $8,800. A bearish trend for Bitcoin could materialize if the asset falls in spite of the monthly candle close, which has historically been a period controlled by bulls.

Some other factors

Social media and search engine engagement for cryptocurrency-related keywords as a direct result of Chinese President Xi Jinping endorsing blockchain technology has increased, especially on Chinese platforms like Baidu.

Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has begun to support the Russian ruble on the platform, as the company is now targeting the Russian market. This is happening on the backdrop of Russia and China — with ambiguous regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrencies — beginning to see progress in developing regulations that may later play as macro factors for the price trend of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

However, cryptocurrency trading still remains prohibited in China, and the People’s Bank of China — the nation’s central bank — has no intention to publicly allow digital asset trading in the near future. Despite this, Bitcoin in China has good local liquidity, according to Primitive Crypto founder Dovey Wanshe:

“For fiat buyers, all the Chinese exchanges operate big OTC, Huobi OTC volume is around a few hundred millions of $ every day on a conservative side Local liquidity of Bitcoin in China is EXTREMELY good.”

With Bitcoin showing a high level of volatility — which it normally does not demonstrate — and potentially large markets for the asset opening up to blockchain technology, macro factors could add to the upside movement of BTC if it breaks out upon its monthly open.",,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/19/11/14708931/crypto-industry-celebrates-bitcoin-whitepaper-11th-anniversary,"The world’s first cryptocurrency Bitcoin celebrated its 11th birthday on Oct. 31.

This is the day when an anonymous actor(s) publicly introduced the digital currency in a whitepaper entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

The Bitcoin genesis block was later mined by Nakamoto in January 2009 — creating the first 50 Bitcoins, and bringing the currency into real action.

Regulatory Hurdles and Critics

Through these 11 years, many prominent individuals and organizations, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Jamie Dimon, have predicted Bitcoin’s “impending doom,” calling it a “bubble,” an “exit scam,” or even “rat poison squared,” among other things.

Many governments across the globe have also come around the idea of a decentralized currency.

Pizza For $91M, Anyone?

On May 22, 2010, Bitcoin programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC to a fellow Bitcoin advocate for a couple of Papa John’s (NASDAQ: PZZA) pizzas.

Those pizzas sold for approximately $41 at the time, are now worth $91.3 million, as of today’s market price for Bitcoin at $9,137.4.

May 22 is celebrated as “Bitcoin Pizza Day” in the community and used to highlight the success of Bitcoin as a financial instrument over the years.

Bitcoin shortly crossed over $20,000 in December 2017, hitting its highest value ever before falling down again.

Increased Competition, But Bitcoin Still King

Digital currency tracking platform CoinMarketCap lists more than 2300 coins on its website. Yet, Bitcoin makes up for more than 67% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, while the other coins share the rest.

Bitcoin also faces competition from traditional companies and banks, who want to launch their own versions of blockchain-based currencies. But the most ardent supporters stick with Bitcoin’s decentralized model.",,https://gizmodo.com/french-students-will-now-have-to-learn-about-bitcoin-1839547502,"Photo : Amanda C ( Flickr

High school students in France may be among the first people in the world to actually understand how cryptocurrency works.

The Next Web reports that the French education ministry, Le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, will integrate cryptocurrency into its curriculum and teach students the influence that bitcoin has on the economy. An outline of the curriculum notes that under this new module, high school teachers will provide a basic overview of cryptocurrency so students can understand the framework of decentralized financial systems.

France announced the decision in June, but cryptocurrency reporters in the U.S. and France have learned of the new curriculum this week.

The education ministry recommends teachers use four educational videos that address questions like “Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?” and “Can Bitcoin replace the Euro?”

According to the cryptocurrency outlet Decrypt, the curriculum outline advises that students should watch the videos and discuss the differences between fiat money (like the dollars in your pocket) and bitcoin.

This is far from the first time academic institutions will be encouraged to teach students about cryptocurrency. A recent Coinbase report found that 42 percent of top universities feature blockchain and cryptocurrency course. But France’s new suggested curriculum is likely the first nationwide program that encourages blockchain studies.

No matter how you feel about cryptocurrency, encouraging young students to understand financial systems can only benefit them and the future economy. If recent generations of students had a healthy balance of STEM and economics in their curriculum, we wouldn’t be as screwed as we are now.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/01/french-kids-will-now-learn-about-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-at-school-cest-woke/,"French high school children will soon learn about Bitcoin, after the cryptocurrency was added to the syllabus for Economics and Social Sciences.

Le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, the French education ministry, has outlined Bitcoin‘s inclusion in the curriculum, noting how it will use the cryptocurrency to help students think about the characteristics of money.

Given the pupils’ youth, Bitcoin will not be explored in great depth, rather it’s more of an introductory overview to help students understand the notion of decentralization in the context of mainstream financial systems.

As part of the course, the ministry has also created four explainer videos, which include “Can Bitcoin replace the Euro?” and “Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?,” to help students get a better understanding of how the cryptocurrency works and how it compares to fiat.

The news comes after a France‘s Financia Business School began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment in October last year.

It’s also worth noting that several other universities across the world accept the cryptocurrency as payment and offer courses about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology to their students.

French President Emmanuel Macron has long pushed for advancements in technology and innovation, hoping to make France into an international superpower in both arenas — and his efforts have seemingly paid off as Paris recently overtook Berlin in terms of capital raised by technology startups.

Earlier this year, he commented on blockchain’s potential to make the agricultural industry more transparent, during a speech at the International Agricultural Fair, held in Paris.

The news was initially reported by Cointelegraph Brazil on Nov. 1.

All in the name of preserving forex reserves

The measures were published in a communication covering several industries in which credit card use was limited or prohibited. The section referring to cryptocurrency reads:

“Acquisition of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies: It is prohibited to purchase BTC with this payment method. The only remaining alternative for this investment is to do so with funds transferred from a bank account.”

It is unclear whether the rules apply only to credit cards or if this includes debit and prepaid cards.

The BCA says that these measures are critical to preserving the country’s foreign exchange reserves.

Bitcoin just part of a wide-ranging crackdown

According to experts, the central bank intends to block the entry of dollars into the country, seeking to have stronger exchange control.

This follows a move by the BCA earlier this week, which limited the amount of U.S. Dollars Argentinian citizens could buy each month. The maximum amount was reduced from $10,000 to just $200.

A firm called Vault12 launched its new passkey security solution for cryptocurrency assets. Vault12 is an application that allows people to enlist their trusted friends and family members to help safeguard their assets. According to the project’s creators, the new application leverages the cryptographic algorithm Shamir’s Secret Sharing which allows keys to be split in a distributed fashion.

Distributing Digital Asset Seeds Using Vault12 and Shamir’s Secret Sharing

Vault12 believes there’s a dire need to safeguard crypto assets as the onset of blockchain-powered innovation continues to grow exponentially. Since the birth of Bitcoin and a slew of other digital currencies, various applications and devices like hardware wallets have been created to protect cryptos. Vault12’s new product allows individuals to take advantage of trusted family members and friends who are willing to help them secure digital currencies. Moreover, guardians are rewarded with ethereum (ETH) to protect the assets as well, giving the trusted network of friends incentive to be a safe keeper. The project officially launched at the San Francisco Blockchain Week and the company is backed by investors like Naval Ravikant, True Ventures, Data Collective, and Winklevoss Capital.

The Vault12 white paper explains when it comes to precious digital assets, there is an “unprecedented threat level” looming for people in need of a strong security solution. “To protect these assets, we need a new cryptographic security platform – one that does not leave security centralized in a single place, with a single person, on a single device or in a single organization,” the research paper details. In order to bolster the security of digital currencies even more, the firm created a decentralized storage system for digital assets via a hierarchical Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) system. The SSS infrastructure is a well known algorithm in cryptography designed by the cryptographer and mathematician Adi Shamir. Essentially the secret (passkey) is shared in the distributed Vault12 system between 3-5 trusted contacts giving each participant its own unique part.

Vault12 Hopes to Fill the Gap Between the Digital Currency Economy and Unresolved Security Challenges

Vault12 allows any owner to set up a vault with friends and family. Custodians can always be recruited from the owner’s personal network at any time. But high-net-worth individuals who need added security can opt for a professional custodian service (PCS). However, the registration for this service requires far more effort and additional safeguards like verifying the owners’ identity with a government-issued ID. “One of the unresolved challenges for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and the blockchain economy is the continued challenge and burden associated with securing crypto assets,” said Max Skibinksy, cofounder and CEO of Vault12. Skibinksy further added:

Previously, to keep our digital money safe, we had to keep our extremely valuable cryptographic backups on pieces of paper and store them in traditional banks. It was ironic. We built Vault12 to be an innovative, convenient solution that replaced this cumbersome process.

Vault12 Setup

Setting up the Vault12 application is a fairly simple process, but you need to decide on 3-5 trusted individuals to help secure your assets. That part of the process may take longer, but setting up the vault after this decision is made doesn’t take too long. The app works for Android and iOS devices and when opened, it immediately asks you if you want to set up a vault and then asks permission to access your phone’s contacts. The company claims the information is not held on the company’s server and you can skip this part and manually add each contact individually as well. After deciding on sharing your contacts with the application, the platform asks you for your name so you can be identified by your guardians helping you protect your vault.

The platform then requires you to choose the number of guardians between 3-5 contacts and the more custodians you use, the more secure the vault will be. Once you save the security level (number of guardians), you cannot change it unless you start a whole new vault. If you opted to manually add contacts, you can send them an invitation or scan their device if they already have Vault12 installed. To add digital assets to the vault you simply upload a picture of the seed phrase or use a file containing the seed. The application will inform you of how many people are guarding the seed held within the Vault12 system.

Overall the Vault12 method is an interesting, novel method of safekeeping digital assets but people may have a hard time with a few requirements such as sharing their name, phone number, and contacts. People also may not trust the upload part where the user is required to upload a file or an image that contains a seed phrase protecting digital assets. However, the project’s key elements are open source and Vault12 users can take a look at the ZAX relay network infrastructure and the distribution of how the shards work. “In the future, other elements of the platform will be released as open-source libraries,” Vault12’s website notes.

A global economic slowdown has already begun as central banks scramble to prop up their economies by printing more money. The last financial crisis was caused by banks and it is highly likely they’ll be responsible for the next one.

Keep On Printing

Just over a decade ago the world was plunged into the largest financial crisis since the 1920s. The US banking system single-handedly collapsed the world economy by over lending to cover derivatives trading. It took years to recover but it seems like the economic skies are darkening again.

Last week the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates for the third time this year. The move is largely to encourage spending and borrowing while discouraging saving. For President Trump, however, this is not enough as he wants negative interest rates.

In another typical Trump tirade the POTUS blasted the FED again late last week stating that the central bank is a bigger economic threat than China, which is having its own banking problems.

“The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar & Rates are hurting…”

People are VERY disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar & Rates are hurting… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2019

Most economists are in agreement that Trump’s war on trade with China has caused more damage to the US economy than high interest rates.

With the FED creating more money the dollar value deflates even further. Since 1913 the greenback has plummeted in value. According to research, back then a person with $100 could buy the same amount of food, clothing, and other necessities as $2,529 would buy today.

Former congressman and Bitcoin bull Ron Paul also took a swipe at the current banking system adding;

“The dollars that you work hard for are always buying less and less, yet the government tells you there’s ‘not enough inflation’. The Fed is a government-created monopoly that counterfeits dollars by the trillions, and you’re supposed to believe that this is “capitalism.””

The dollars that you work hard for are always buying less and less, yet the government tells you there's 'not enough inflation'.

Bitcoin Solves This

Bitcoin, with a predetermined supply, immunity from central bank meddling, and decentralization from any state or nation makes it the perfect solution for this problem. In theory Bitcoin would become the world’s currency giving the control back to the people, not the banks. A massively flawed banking system was the catalyst that spawned Bitcoin in the first place. As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote himself;

“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”

The banks of the world are starting to take measures to prevent another 2008, but the writing could already be on the wall. Bitcoin does solve this as it was designed to.

Ron Paul now owns a gold plated Bitcoin wallet

Lee publicly announced the gift he had given to Paul on Nov. 2, noting that the coin has been loaded into a gold-plated Bitcoin wallet produced by his company Ballet Crypto. He added that extra care has been given to customizing the wallet to better suit the former congressman:

“It was a special serial number AA000820 to match his birthday! And he loves the #Gold color.”

The wallets produced by Lee’s company are non-electronic physical wallets meant for cold storage of cryptocurrency. Their format is similar to that of a credit card, and they feature the passphrase of the wallet under a scratchable layer.

Freedom of money

Paul received the gift at a lunch that took place at the Litecoin (LTC) summit 2019, also in the presence of Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, who said that all three of them share some ideals:

“We are all #libertarian — personal liberty and #freedomofmoney.”

Paul — an outspoken critic of the Federal Reserve — is known for his advocacy of gold. With regards to Bitcoin, Paul noted in July that he’s in favor of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology because he supports competing currencies.

Paul’s stance is also in stark contrast with the ideas of U.S. congressman Brad Sherman, who believes that cryptocurrencies — potentially competing with the national currency, i.e. the dollar — should be banned. In late October, he said:

“Cryptocurrency either doesn’t work, in which case investors lose a lot of money, or it does achieve its objectives perhaps and displaces the U.S. dollar or interferes with the U.S. dollar being virtually the sole reserve currency in the world.”

On the other hand, not all U.S. representatives share Sherman’s dollar maximalist view. As Cointelegraph reported this week, two congressmen showed support on Bitcoin’s 11th birthday, noting that the technology has created “infinite possibilities for technological innovation and privacy protections.”",,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-will-btc-paint-q4-green-with-gains/,"Bitcoin Price Bitcoin Price: Will BTC Cross $10,000 This Quarter?

Is Bitcoin Price Ready to Hit the Five-Figure Mark, Again?

Popular crypto trader and analyst, Josh Rager pointed out his latest observation about the bitcoin market a few hours ago. He noted that BTC has been lying in the sidelines far too long. But the trend seems to be changing. Especially after a $100 move which has taken bitcoin price above the $9300 mark. According to him, it shows folks are badly waiting for this ‘compressed pattern to break out.

He feels that BTC needs to chart a higher high and ‘crack through high volume node (resistance) overhead’. Trading, in general, is 80% psychological, so the word goes. Market movements, especially in the nascent bitcoin and cryptocurrency space, is largely governed by the sentiment of the participants. As it was clearly visible in one of the polls on Josh’s Twitter page today.

A majority want BTC to break past the $9600 mark.

Bullish push up to 5 digits again — Josh Rager 📈 (@Josh_Rager) November 1, 2019

Well-known bitcoin commentator, Crypto Rand presented the case ‘bullish case for bitcoin’ for Q4-2019 a few days back. Applying the falling wedge pattern to bitcoin’s ongoing price action, he expects a ‘reversal pattern’ to play out. This would obviously be confirmed on the breakout of the upper trendline in the pattern. BTC prices could revisit the $14,000 highs attained earlier this year. The scenario is pretty much a possibility.

BTC Realized Market Cap Hits Another High

Realized market cap differs in its calculation from standard market cap. The time since each coin last moved is multiplied by the value of the transaction in which it moved. The result gives a value that some commentators say more fairly shows how dominant bitcoin, in fact, is within cryptocurrency.

Industry observer, Rhythm pointed out today that BTC’s realized market cap has clocked an all-time high of $102.9 billion. This also means that the total amount paid for bitcoin has never been higher than today. This pretty much paints a bullish picture for the market going into the year-end.

Network Fundamentals Are Stronger Than Ever

Frankly, it’s surprising to see bitcoin not getting dumped and holding strong in the $9000-$9500 range. We witnessed BTC’s rally on Halloween/Whitepaper Anniversary and are pretty much confirmed that strong hands (read big bad BTC bulls) don’t want prices to dip below the $9000.

But a point worth noting is the growing strength of bitcoin network fundamentals. Co-founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Anthony Pompliano expressed this trend best in one of his uber bullish BTC tweets yesterday.

195 days until the next Bitcoin halving. Less than 3 million Bitcoin left to mine. Hash rate keeps hitting all-time highs. We are watching the strongest computer network in the world continue to get stronger and stronger. Incredible. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) November 1, 2019

Here is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph Turkey.

Cointelegraph opens new office in Istanbul, Turkey

On Oct. 24, Cointelegraph’s global coverage expanded again with the launch of its Turkish edition. Turkey joined Cointelegraph’s existing bureaus in Germany, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Korea, Spain, and Serbia.

Erhan Kahraman, the editor who will lead the charge, said that Cointelegraph Turkey will expand the global presence of Cointelegraph in the region and will “create a local knowledge base for newcomers to the crypto community, while also covering breaking news from around the globe, price analysis, and market updates for veteran traders.”

Binance CEO to speak at Turkish summit in Istanbul

Cointelegraph reported that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ within the crypto community, will be attending and speaking at the Turkish Capital Market Summit, which will be held in Istanbul from Nov. 19–20, 2019.

CZ will join members of Turkey’s presidential administration. Dr. Ali Taha Koç, the Head of the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey and Arda Ermut, the Head of the Investment Office of the Presidency. The summit also invited major figures in the banking sector, investors and top executives, such as CEO of major holding company Koç Holding, Levent Çakıroğlu.

Gokhan Seckin, the CEO of digital ID firm Kimlic, will present CZ with a number of questions that are selected by the Turkish community.

BtcTurk CEO Özgür Güneri: Soccer is the right tool for reaching the masses

Having started its operations at the beginning of July 2013, BtcTurk was the first of five cryptocurrency exchange platforms in Turkey. The exchange has attracted great attention not only in the local press but also worldwide, with a multitude of sponsorship agreements and visual ads in the world of sports, more specifically, soccer.

The CEO of BtcTurk, Özgür Güneri, said during an interview with Cointelegraph Turkey on Oct. 30 that Bitcoin ads displayed during Turkish soccer games are the right tool for reaching the masses.

In the same interview, Güneri commented on the comparison of Bitcoin to the role of gold as a store of value. He said: “Needs determine where Bitcoin is going. But I do not think that the first priority is to buy coffee.”

Interbank Card Center CEO Soner Canko: Bitcoin solves trust problem

The CEO of the Interbank Card Center Soner Canko, said during a YouTube podcast hosted by Özgür Güneri that the most important problem in the financial world is the trust between parties. The CEO is seemingly convinced that this can be eliminated with blockchain technology, adding that cryptocurrencies are in demand because they provide a solution to this problem of trust in the world. He said:",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cme-group-publishes-bitcoin-options-specifications/,"CME Group Publishes Bitcoin Options Specifications

In mid-September, the foreign exchange company CME Group announced the launch of options on its bitcoin futures contracts in Q1 2020, pending regulatory review. CME Group executive Tim McCourt said there was “increasing client demand” for the firm’s bitcoin derivatives and now the company has published specifications for the options products.

CME Group’s Bitcoin Options

The global markets company CME Group has provided clients with the ability to hedge or trade benchmark options on futures across nearly every asset class. The firm has an average daily volume of $4.3 million this year and aims to offer options on bitcoin futures so investors can have a variety of different methods to trade the asset. When CME announced the launch of bitcoin options, McCourt detailed that the new product will provide “clients with additional flexibility to trade and hedge their bitcoin price risk.” This week, following Bakkt’s recent volume surges, CME published the preliminary contract specifications for the options. Price values will be based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) which is determined by a variety of major crypto exchanges.

The contract unit will consist of one bitcoin futures contract, which is approximately five BTC quoted in USD. There’s a minimum price fluctuation and the listing cycle will mirror the firm’s bitcoin futures exposure. CME’s bitcoin options on futures will be traded between Sunday through Friday on Globex and Clearport. The company notes that the BTC options product is subject to revision and review by financial regulators. “We’re working to launch options on those futures,” McCourt said to crypto analyst Benjamin Pirus in a recent interview. “The option on the bitcoin future will give the holder of that option, either a put or a call, the right — but not necessarily the obligation, to either purchase or sell the underlying futures contracts at maturity.” McCourt further stressed:

It’s very similar to the way other options in the marketplace work. The difference here is the underlying, or the deliverable, of the options contract, is a CME Group bitcoin future.

Is Bitcoin Being ‘Tamed’ Like a Traditional Investment?

Bakkt’s physically-delivered bitcoin futures product has been getting a lot of fanfare lately after the exchange topped a few new records and CEO Kelly Loeffler announced Bakkt will be offering options on bitcoin futures as well. Despite the all-time highs at the Bakkt warehouse, CME Group’s BTC derivatives have seen much more volume. CME’s Globex saw 7,242 bitcoin futures contracts on October 28 and 3,284 in open interest. The following days on Globex through November 1, contracts were between 2,200 and 3,687. November’s CME bitcoin futures contracts today stand at 2,641 contracts and December positions are starting to pile up as well.

The crypto derivatives markets and products have matured a great deal since they launched and it’s been a touch less than two years since CME launched its BTC-based futures. At the time, the company’s chairman emeritus Leo Melamed told Reuters in an interview that adding BTC futures was a “very important step for bitcoin’s history.” Melamed added that he believed institutional investors would be very interested in the new asset class. “We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.” Since then a slew of different companies have offered bitcoin-based derivatives products and futures are coming to other cryptocurrencies like ETH and BCH as well. Reports detail that BCH futures are expected to debut on a CFTC-regulated exchange in Q1 2020.

Turkey is the world's 20th biggest economy. It may be most well-known internationally for its authoritarian President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but it's set to become increasingly important for the global cryptocurrency industry. (Updated on November 9: updates in bold.)

At the moment, trading volumes in BTC/TRY (Turkish lira) are fairly small compared to other major fiat currencies, but recent news indicates that crypto-related companies are setting their sights on the Eurasian country. In October, Huobi announced it will launch an option to trade TRY for tethers (USDT) by the end of the year, while mobile-based cryptocurrency Electroneum signed a deal with three Turkish telecom operators to enable people to pay for airtime using ETN.

And with the Turkish government's plans to introduce its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) by 2023, it's likely that cryptocurrency and blockchain will increase its prominence in Turkey in the years to come.

""There is a huge drive for new and innovative blockchain projects and also the Government is very pro Blockchain. As such, we consider Turkey as one of the most exciting markets in the world both in terms of crypto enthusiast and crypto trading,"" Mohit Davar, Huobi’s EMEA regional president, says, adding that with the population of 80 million and 30 million having internet access, Turkey hold a ""huge potential to contribute in the crypto adoption and ecosystem."" Moreover, ""a lot of young people have joined forced together to deliver blockchain based projects.""

Crypto ownership

Turkey is reportedly one of the crypto-friendliest populations in the world. Last year, ING published a survey indicating that 18% of surveyed Turkish citizens own cryptocurrency of one kind or another, in contrast to 9% of Europeans and 8% of Americans.

This seems hard to believe when data from Coin.Dance and CryptoCompare indicate that the Turkish bitcoin market is pretty small compared to other national markets. For instance, Coin.Dance data relating to trading on the LocalBitcoins P2P exchange reveals that an average of 11.2 bitcoins were traded for Turkish lira each week in 2019 (so far), while the weekly averages for the British pound and New Zealand dollar (representing a much smaller economy than Turkey) are 473 and 25 bitcoins, respectively.

Still, other surveys and indicators suggest that cryptocurrency ownership in Turkey is fairly common, even if the trading volumes for TRY are relatively low. When the Turkish lira plummeted in value last August, Bitcoin.org reported that it saw a 42% increase in visits from users in Istanbul, while trading volumes on Turkish exchanges increased.

And according to the 2019 Statista Global Consumer Survey, 20% of surveyed Turkish people do own cryptocurrency, closely replicating the findings of ING's earlier survey.

Admittedly, it's hard to believe that 16 million Turks own crypto, but the fact that more than one source indicates this kind of figure would support the idea that crypto is popular in Turkey.

“Yes, the cryptocurrency industry is very popular in Turkey nowadays and more and more investors are showing interest in crypto sector each year in Turkey,” the Sistemkoin team, one of Turkey’s biggest crypto-exchanges, tells Cryptonews.com.

Trading volume on this exchange stands at USD 162 million in the past 24 hours (November 1, 11:05 UTC), while the BTC/TRY share is almost 20%.

Trading volume on Sistemkoin

And where there's an increasing ownership of cryptocurrencies, there's a growing market for crypto- and blockchain-related companies.

Start-up ecosystem

This would explain why such companies have started to focus more on Turkey in recent months. Aside from the aforementioned announcements from Huobi and Electroneum, Turkey's largest privately owned investment bank, Aktif Bank, launched its own cryptocurrency exchange in February, named Bitmatrix.

In terms of blockchain startups and companies, Turkey is still small, but there are signs that this is changing.

For one, the country hosted the first ever Eurasia Blockchain Summit in October, where over 1,400 attendees from industry, politics and finance gathered. It also hosts or has hosted a number of other related conferences, including the Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Turkey, Blockchain Economy: Istanbul, and the EuroAsia Cryptocurrency Investment Summit.

Secondly, there are several Turkish crypto start-ups to go with such events, although the total is still small compared to other nations. According to market research firm Tracxn, there are 54 blockchain start-ups in Turkey (as of August 2019), while in the United States and London there are 2,601 and 745, respectively.

Put differently, Turkey's blockchain start-up ecosystem is equal to only 2% of the United States', even though its population is roughly a quarter of the size of US’.

It is, in other words, still a minor blockchain and crypto nation, even if things have begun to turn a corner since last year.

Moreover, according to Mohit Davar, local universities are also bringing in blockchain as a part of curriculum: ""This is not something that we have seen to this extent in the other parts of the world.""

Government intervention

“So far, there has been no laws and regulations regarding the cryptocurrency sector in Turkey,” says Sistemkoin, indicating that this might put the sector at a disadvantage.

“Nevertheless, the government of Turkey has included a central bank-issued digital currency in its 2019–2023 economic roadmap. So it can be concluded that the Turkish government is less likely to restrict or prohibit the use of cryptocurrency in future.”

Not only that, but as part of its digital strategy for 2023, the government also laid down plans for a national blockchain infrastructure.

These plans will see the government establish an open-source platform for using and developing distributed ledger technology. It will be used by the government itself for its own digital infrastructure projects, but it will also be open to use by Turkish firms and organizations.

In conjunction with a potential CBDC, it's highly likely that Turkey's nascent crypto and blockchain sector will be given a significant boost by these initiatives. This is especially the case in light of how the existence and circulation of a CBDC will force Turkish business and the Turkish economy more generally to adopt the infrastructure needed to process it.

Of course, a commitment to distributed ledger technology may still leave Bitcoin and cryptocurrency more generally in an ambiguous position. But given the existing popularity of crypto and the government’s newfound zeal for blockchain, both cryptocurrencies and blockchain are likely to gain further traction in the future.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-is-not-only-unnecessary-its-unethical/,"Andrew Yang’s 'Freedom Dividend' Is Not Only Unnecessary, It’s Unethical

Andrew Yang has taken to Twitter in dynamic fashion as of late, advertising his universal basic income (UBI) proposal known as the “Freedom Dividend.” While throwing money at people out of pocket always generates a buzz, there’s a mathematically and ethically broken side to the plan few are talking about.

A Real-Life Political Cartoon

Not so long ago people used to joke about the typical shyster politician and their larger than life campaign promises. Wisecracks about the next White House wannabe centered around grease-ball politicians literally throwing money at voters to buy their support. Well now, under the guise of a hip new presidential campaign, the money throwing is actually happening. To critique Andrew Yang is no easy task, given the understandable and dynamic support he’s received against the backdrop of a totally corrupt and greedy political and financial system. It stands to ask, though: Is he really set to change things? Upon closer examination, UBI is little more than an inept and unethical ploy for socioeconomic power.

If it feels this good to give 10 Americans $1,000 a month imagine how it will feel to do the same for hundreds of millions of us. It will be one of the greatest days in human history. — Andrew Yang🧢 (@AndrewYang) November 1, 2019

Math. It’s a discipline unlike others for its exact answers and lack of room for debate. One plus one is two. There’s not much dissent possible here, outside of the occasional stoner drum circle or deep metaphysical fireside discussion. Nothing wrong with either, of course, but this is just to lay the groundwork for an argument. Namely, that one cannot give away value one doesn’t have. While Yang is currently giving a “Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families” out of his own pocket, once in office that money set to “do the same for hundreds of millions of us” will come from your pockets.

Mixed Up Math

Yang’s campaign website lays out the groundwork for his proposed “Freedom Dividend.” While a dividend is usually defined as a share of profits paid out to shareholders, Yang’s “dividend” will be made possible “by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value Added Tax of 10 percent.” Not exactly a share of profits as much as money pulled from the pockets of Americans, but for the sake of argument, that will do for now. In assuaging fears of inflation, negative economic impact and even incoming communism, Yang maintains on the site:

The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for bank bailouts in its quantitative easing program with no inflation.

This assessment is massively dishonest, and if not, massively ignorant of basic economic realities. It ignores math, in other words. There are many types of inflation and some of the most pernicious hide beneath the surface of popular reference. While consumer price index inflation (CPI) may appear almost unaffected during some periods of quantitative easing (QE) due to a mix of market factors (including the psychological aspect of consumer confidence), asset price inflation is the real trigger for more serious problems. In other words, even as the debt racket of modern government paper spirals out of control, if the people are confident in their money and the state’s reassurance of its value, CPI may stay relatively stable, and businesses will be unable to increase prices due to this psychology and other factors such as healthy, corrective deflation.

While Yang claims the printing of $4 trillion for bailouts caused “no inflation” the housing and asset market is calling BS in unprecedented and truly frightening fashion. If a house was worth $200,000 five years ago, and now is worth $300,000, this doesn’t necessarily mean the house changed, or that the property became legitimately more valuable. What it often means is that the dollar became significantly weaker against the asset. As these asset prices are thus inflated, banks are able to give out bigger and bigger loans against the asset collateral. Once the jig is up, the bubble bursts and the tumble down is severe, with collateral value no longer covering loans. The graph above shows just how dramatically this buildup is happening currently, with asset inflation signaled by U.S. household net worth against GDP at an all-time-high since 1952 of 535%.

Stolen Generosity

Not only is Yang’s proposition economically unsound, it’s also morally objectionable. This is a hard pill to swallow for many hopeful millennials and Yang gang supporters of all ages, tired of scraping by and struggling in the current corrupt, Keynesian paradigm. That notwithstanding, Yang’s “Forward” is no different from the vague and vapid “Hope,” Change,” or “I’m a better man” of previous candidates.

To pay the Freedom Dividend, Yang proposes you be robbed. Business owners not wishing to apply his suggested VAT would be punished for refusal. Consumers not wishing to pay it, as well. It’s an unpleasant reality, but there’s no way to put it more accurately. Yang explains:

A Value Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share.

Many are unsure of what Andrew Yang’s fair share of their income should be. If I similarly were forced to pay every neighbor I have a portion of my paycheck because 15 or 20 of them said I must, or be put in a cage, people would be understandably scandalized by the sociopathic suggestion. But if the theft is euphemized as a “Freedom Dividend” it’s suddenly made much more palatable to the masses. While some maintain taxation is a necessary evil for preserving civilization, this position is illogical. There’s nothing civil about stealing from anyone under threat of violence, and a social need doesn’t justify criminal activity, anyway. If it did, the folks in the U.S. during the plantation slavery era would have been correct in their protests against abolition: “But who will pick the cotton!?”

Bitcoin’s Fix

Leaving Andrew Yang’s universe for a moment, it seems important to address crypto as a potential solution for the current political corruption he supposedly stands against. A recent opinion piece in the Washington Post proclaims: “Facebook’s cryptocurrency won’t help the poor access banks. Here’s what would.” The piece goes on to detail the impossibility of Facebook’s upcoming Libra cryptocurrency actually helping the unbanked of the world, due to government regulations. The article un-ironically closes by suggesting that the very same overbearing government is the solution, stating: “It’s true that financial inclusion would help millions of Americans and benefit the economy. But it can be achieved through time-tested and democratic institutions. In fact, the United States already has a public payments system: the Federal Reserve.”

What so few in the space seem to realize about crypto is that the potential for banking the unbanked, pulling people out of poverty, and enabling savings and the building of wealth for the average individual is already here. The state stands in the way with endless surveillance, KYC/AML requirements, taxes and capital controls, so it happens in the regulatory cracks, at present.

Instead of a $1,000 monthly paycheck in trash money, why not drop all restrictions on trade and allow people to grow their wealth and businesses independently? If we’re worried that criminal warlords and kingpins would take over, just look around — they already have. It is precisely because of the illogical centralization of power and lack of a logical, level playing field that a candidate like Yang can gain any prominence at all. In a free society — and no offense here to Yang personally — he’d likely be known as just a common con artist.

During a recent Congress hearing regarding Facebook’s digital currency project Libra, US Congressman Brad Sherman warned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the potential to threaten the US dollar’s dominance over the global financial system.

“Cryptocurrency either doesn’t work, in which case investors lose a lot of money, or it does achieve its objectives perhaps and displaces the US dollar or interferes with the US dollar being virtually the sole reserve currency in the world,” he said.

Sherman claimed the US dollar’s dominance over other currencies brings multiple benefits for Americans, such as profits generated by the Federal Reserve for the US Treasury and the ability to influence other countries’ policies and actions through the use of economic sanctions.

“We stand to lose all that because cryptocurrency is the currency of the crypto-patriot,” Sherman argued.

Beating the dollar’s monopoly

This isn’t the first time politicians have expressed concerns about the impact of Bitcoin on the US dollar. In a May 2018 interview with CNBC, St Louis Fed President James Bullard said while Bitcoin is not a threat at this point, “we don’t know how the future’s going to unfold”.

He added: “The dollar has been the winner historically because it’s backed by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy in terms of low inflation, and that’s going to be tough to beat. But a lot of people here want to beat it.”

Meanwhile, a Congressional report released at the end of 2013 warned that if greater use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies leads to multiple monetary units, the stability offered by a single, incumbent currency (the US dollar) could be threatened, particularly if new currencies continue to exhibit high volatility.

The authors said that if Bitcoins are substituted for dollars on a systematic, long-term basis, it would decrease the need to hold dollars and increase the supply of fiat money. This could reduce the demand for dollars, which would affect the rate of circulation.

“In this case, for the Fed to maintain the same degree of monetary accommodation, it would need to undertake a compensating tightening of monetary policy,” the report said.

“At a minimum, a substantial use of Bitcoins could make the measurement of velocity more uncertain, and judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy uncertain.”

Crypto appeal grows

Although any potential threat to the US dollar looks a long way off, the substantial rise in Bitcoin’s value relative to the US dollar is likely to cause heightened concerns. Some analysts reckon the BTC/USD price could reach $100,000 by the end of 2021.

Several countries around the world have also made moves to shift away from the US dollar’s influence. Iran, for instance, recently launched its own cryptocurrency, and a group of several West African states plan to adopt a single fiat currency called the eco by 2020.

The biggest disruption to the US dollar’s influence, however, could be the issuance of a digital currency by a major central bank. If national digital currencies enable faster and cheaper international money transfers, they could be seen as realistic alternatives to the US dollar.

Viable alternative

Whether it is Bitcoin, a national digital currency, or another type of cryptocurrency, there is certainly a growing movement to replace a fiat-based, single-issuer global reserve currency with a sovereign-free, algorithm-based alternative. Many argue it would be more stable and trustworthy than the US dollar.

The main arguments against Bitcoin as an alternative are, firstly, a global currency needs to have a flexible supply and, secondly, Bitcoin is too volatile to become a universal settlement token for trading contracts. Some experts, however, argue Bitcoin’s volatility can be overcome by hedging exposure – and not necessarily against the US dollar, but against currency issued by a central bank directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

At the moment, it seems unlikely that major businesses and governments will give up their preference for fiat, which gives them a degree of control. But as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies start to mature and gain wider acceptance, it’s easy to imagine a future in which the US dollar isn’t the world’s sole reserve currency.",2019-11-02 14:00:31+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/regulated-eth-futures-not-so-fast,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s Director of Research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.

Earlier this month, Heath Tarbert – the new chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – declared that ether, the token of the ethereum blockchain, was a commodity.

This is significant, coming from the regulator of one of the largest derivatives markets in the world. Why? Because it opens the door to the possibility of regulated ether derivatives in the near future. The chairman was even more specific: “I’d say it is likely that you would see a futures contract in the next six months to a year.”

The market got excited because this would enhance the token’s appeal to institutional investors. Derivatives enable hedging, which is a significant part of portfolio management and a solid support for long positions. A lively derivatives market, the reasoning goes, will encourage more investment, which will boost the price, which will encourage more investment, and so on.

Yet, with respect, I believe the chairman is mistaken. We will not see ether futures in significant volume on a regulated U.S. exchange any time soon. If ever.

Reputation risk

Although it’s not just about the lack of demand, let’s look at that first.

Ether futures currently trade on exchanges based outside the U.S., but volumes have been thin relative to the spot market. On BitMEX, Huobi and Deribit, three of the largest crypto platforms that offer ether futures, the average 24-hour volume is less than 10% that of bitcoin, while the equivalent ratio in the spot market is almost 25%.

The difference could be due to ethereum’s relative youth, and the gap could close as the network matures. Or it could be that bitcoin will always be the institutional-grade asset of choice, rendering ether derivative demand too insignificant for major markets to profitably develop.

Either way, demand can be flexible. The real barriers to a successful launch of ether derivatives go much deeper.

Underlying risk

Last week ethereum developers announced the target date for the next system-wide upgrade: December 4. This will be executed via a hard fork, in which the entire ecosystem needs to change – blocks processed on the old version will not be valid on the new. There are several of these coming up.

This introduces an additional element of risk into the market. Earlier this year, an upgrade was delayed just 48 hours before it was due to launch, due to a “critical vulnerability.” And while it is extremely likely that bugs will be found and fixed in time, there is always the “what if?” that risk-takers have to focus on.

Even more worrying for ether derivative watchers is the upcoming consensus algorithm shift. Ethereum currently runs on a proof-of-work consensus algorithm similar to that of bitcoin. It has long been working on a migration to a different system, called proof-of-stake, in which the amount of ether you “stake” gives you the credentials to validate transactions and append new blocks on the blockchain.

This is like changing the motor of your car while it is speeding along the highway. No matter how much testing is done and no matter how many parallel systems are in operation, it’s risky.

True, risk is precisely what derivatives were invented to mitigate – but the creators of derivative products like to have that risk reasonably quantifiable. While derivatives can help investors control risk, they don’t eliminate it; they redistribute it. The extra risk for exchanges will need to be compensated, and uncertainty of this magnitude could make ether derivatives prohibitively expensive.

What’s more, when ethereum hard forks over to its new algorithm, there is always a risk that not all miners will switch. The current ethereum network could continue to exist and perhaps even thrive if enough participants wish it. Which token would derivative contracts track?

Existential risk

Another risk looming over ethereum is that of a network rewind. In 2016, in response to a ~$60 million hack of an ethereum-based application, ethereum’s core participants decided to rewind the blockchain to its pre-hack state, restoring the stolen funds and creating a split in the ecosystem that persists to this day.

This was a few years ago, when ethereum was still young and many believed that such a large hack would stunt its growth prospects – few expect it to be able to successfully execute something similar today. But last weekend, ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin posted the following poll on Twitter:

Thankfully, the “never rewind” majority should reassure the market of the blockchain’s integrity and stability. But almost 40% of voters think ethereum should be able to, and the fact that Vitalik is even asking the question is a reminder that it is possible.

Ether may be a “commodity” in the eyes of the CFTC – but, traditionally, commodities can’t change their history or their characteristics. Has the regulator ever approved derivatives based on such a malleable asset? How would you even start ensuring that there is no information asymmetry and the risk is fairly priced in?

But there’s an even more existential question.

Regulatory risk

Ethereum’s proposed algorithm change could lead to a bigger adjustment: ether could stop being a commodity and become a security.

Under proof-of-stake, ether holders can “stake” their tokens in order to influence transaction validation and block creation. In exchange for doing so, they earn an income.

This exchange isn’t dissimilar to how miners earn rewards on a proof-of-work blockchain such as bitcoin. In proof-of-stake, however, the rewards are distributed as annualized interest as opposed to randomized payout making for more regular and predictable returns on ether.

Is this enough to make ether a security rather than a commodity? Maybe.

This would not invalidate any outstanding ether derivatives. It would, however, move them into the joint jurisdiction of the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

This becomes significant when you compare the two securities regulators’ views towards crypto assets. The CFTC has long championed the innovation behind cryptocurrencies – former chairman Chris Giancarlo is affectionately known in the blockchain sector as “Crypto Dad” – and the new chairman’s recent comments referenced earlier show that he seems to feel the same.

The SEC, on the other hand, has repeatedly blocked the issuance of ETFs based on bitcoin, on the grounds that it is too immature a market. If it thinks bitcoin is not ready, it’s a stretch to conclude it will think differently about ethereum.

This is likely to give any regulated derivative platform pause.

Investment risk

So, given ethereum’s development stage and outlook, as well as little evidence of unsatisfied demand, ether derivatives on a U.S.-based regulated exchange are unlikely any time soon. There are a lot of issues to work out, in a sector that is already giving regulators and infrastructure providers more than enough to worry about.

This shouldn’t affect the phenomenal amount of work underway on the platform. It is, however, likely to affect broad institutional acceptance of ether as an investment asset. Large investors rarely take unidirectional bets.

Does that matter? Not necessarily – development will continue, and ethereum could still end up being a new operating system for the economy. Ether was not created as an investment asset.

Then again, nor was bitcoin. Markets have a way of latching on to and commoditizing ideas, and ethereum may one day become the darling of the alternative investment world. It’s still very young, though, has many teething pains ahead of it, and a while to go before traditional financial infrastructure supports its entrance into the mainstream.

Disclosure: The author holds a small amount of bitcoin and ether.

Singapore based crypto exchange Huobi is set to freeze accounts controlled by US residents in an effort to crack down on those individuals violating the User Agreement, according to a post on their website. This announcement comes after a gradual depreciation of US resident accounts over the past few months and will end with a total freeze of all US accounts on November 13th

The Gray Area of US Crypto regulations

Exchanges have long had issues operating within the United States. Many countries in Europe and Asia have provided concrete legislation outlining how to operate a business in the cryptocurrency space.

However, the US has heavily lagged behind on that front. There is no real framework when it comes down to tax payments, running your business, not even the slight assurance by the government to pass laws regarding the same.

Huobi has long been one of the largest crypto exchanges in Asia. At points, they had the highest trading volume than any other exchange in the region. However when China and other large east Asian countries began cracking down on and regulating crypto-currencies, the company began looking towards global expansion by opening offices in Korea and later Japan.

Removing US User Accounts

Huobi has always had language in their Terms of Service banning US users, but there were many cases where US users were able to make accounts and perform trades on the platform. However, Huobi isn’t just running away with their American client’s money.

The exchange is providing a grace period for any remaining Americans on the platform. Until the 13th of November, users will be able to refund Huobi Point Cards and withdraw any remaining crypto funds from their accounts. For more information on the withdraw, check out Huobi’s blog post.

Many people argue that cryptocurrencies will never be accepted as a valid form of money because governments can just pass laws to outlaw them.

“Remember China, China, China!” goes their mantra.

Trouble is, these crypto skeptics ignore the actual, on-the-ground consequences of such “bans” and how easily they can backfire.

Let’s take a quick round-the-world tour, and I’ll show you exactly what I mean. And yes, we can start in Beijing.

Back in 2017, the Chinese authorities didn’t pussyfoot around. They went straight for the jugular — the cryptocurrency exchanges.

That made sense, or so they thought. Exchanges are formal companies that need to be compliant with the regulatory framework of the countries where they operate.

But here’s the big all-important factoid that Beijing seems to have missed: For a population to adopt cryptocurrencies, they don’t need exchanges.

Are exchanges convenient? Yes.

A dire necessity? No

In fact, as I’ll explain in a moment, they are just one of the ways you can exchange your government-sponsored fiat money into cryptocurrency.

Then, once you’ve completed that initial trade, you’re up in crypto-space. You can teleport your money anywhere you want. Your transactions are almost entirely outside the regulatory reach of any country on Earth.

This doesn’t mean cryptocurrencies live in a Martian No Man’s Land. They do follow a set of bylaws. The difference is, they’re not the edicts or directives by any central authority. Instead …

The only rules that apply to a public distributed ledger are the rules of consensus that exist within its network. Nothing else.

In the parlance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission, you might say that cryptocurrency networks are intensely rigorous — but amorphous — self-regulatory organizations.

So, what was the net effect of the so-called “China ban” on cryptocurrencies?

Beijing was unable to outlaw the possession of crypto assets; it’s almost impossible to even track down who owns what where.

They understood this. So, they didn’t even try.

Reason: By their very design, cryptocurrency networks are anonymous.

Or, they’re at least pseudonymous. In other words, although each account and the amount held is public information, it’s not possible to directly tie the ownership of these accounts to any one individual.

Meanwhile, despite the “ban,” China has turned bullish on blockchain.

Last week, President Xi Jinping declared that China must “seize the opportunity” created by blockchain, and that it will play “an important role in the next round of technological innovation and industrial transformation.” And this week, China’s Communist Party is taking a series of steps to follow through.

It underscores the reality that Chinese citizens are still very active trading crypto assets, despite the fact that the “ban” has been in force for over two years.

This is not to say that banning exchanges has no effect whatsoever. Though said effect is limited. If established exchanges are not available, people simply move to specialized social media sites and similar applications.

Consider websites like LocalBitcoins.com, a peer-to-peer trading marketplace, for example.

These sites provide a framework to ...

Agree on terms and ...

Reduce the risk that either side will run off with the money.

In areas where cryptocurrency trading is officially “banned,” these kinds of platforms merely transform into de-facto over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges.

To put it simply:

So far, the only significant effect of crypto bans has been to drive some traders to OTC (over-the-counter) trading platforms.

And it’s not just China. Similar crypto bans in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe have accomplished little beyond making these platforms that much more popular.

Can governments shut down these as well? That would very difficult.

The parties meet anywhere — at a café, outside a bank, on a park bench. They agree to the terms. The fiat portion of the trade is carried out. And once the buyer has transferred the fiat via bank transfer (or even in cash), the seller releases the crypto.

Plus, for additional safety, both the fiat and the crypto can be locked in an escrow account under a smart contract.

Where crypto trading is literally on the street

Does it work? Absolutely! I know because I’ve personally done these over-the-counter trades.

My experience isn’t from a place where crypto is banned, but rather with a government that’s on the brink of default.

As the authorities struggle to make ends meet and keep the lights on, they resort to draconian measures.

That takes us to the next stop on our tour: Argentina, where the government has imposed a whopping 33% tax on international transactions.

Think about that. It means that every time you want to use the banking system to get your money out of the country, the government takes nearly a one-third cut.

Maybe you want to make an online purchase of an airline ticket from a foreign carrier.

Or perhaps you just want to buy the latest smartphone not yet offered in local stores.

It doesn’t matter. If the money leaves Argentina, you pay the tax.

Or, consider the plight of businesspeople …

My father, for example, does business with companies based in Argentina. Whenever he brings the money home, the one-third tax is the equivalent of a massive confiscation.

All with practically zero hope it will end anytime soon!

For him, the only chance to get his money out of the country is to get some Bitcoin.

So to give him a hand, I went to Argentina to see how hard it would be to locate someone trading pesos for Bitcoin. As it turned out, not only did I find individuals, but I also found local dealers.

“If you want to buy Bitcoin,” said one, “you pay us 15% over market. If you want to sell, we pay you at least 10% over market.”

I did even better than the 10%. Bitcoin was selling for about USD 6,000 at the time, and I got between USD 6,800 and USD 7,000. The people I dealt with told me they’d buy as much crypto as I could lay my hands on.

The crypto dealers’ business model makes a lot of sense, and it’s in big demand.

They have high-net-worth clients looking to get their money out of the country. In big amounts and FAST.

So, the dealers keep a healthy stash of cryptocurrency on hand, offering their customers the ability to get their money out of the country while bypassing the banking system. Instead of paying the government’s outrageous 33% tax, the customers are glad to pay the dealer his 15%.

This a big change from the capital-control powers governments used to have just a few years ago!

Back then, when countries imposed capital controls, they could ban black-market dealers and throw them in jail.

Businesspeople would dress like hippies, stuff their backpacks with currency and try walking across the border. But border agents caught them frequently, and the controls were often effective.

Not now! Not in the crypto age!

The flight to Bitcoin in Argentina is the same thing that’s happening in nearly every country that has tried to impose currency controls.

Argentina’s national currency is down 50% against the greenback just in the past year. And now, the same folks who helped cause the crisis have just been voted back into office.

So, no matter what governments do or don’t do, you can see why crypto assets like Bitcoin are the only chance citizens in these countries have to protect their wealth.

At the end of the day, what do governments accomplish with bans or draconian controls?

They help to increase awareness of cryptocurrencies. They’re making crypto more popular.

Maybe we should send them a thank-you email:

“Keep up the good work, guys.”",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/british-tax-authority-updates-cryptocurrency-guidelines-says-it-is-not-money,"The United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), has updated its cryptocurrency taxation guidelines for businesses and individuals.

On Nov. 1, the U.K. government tax agency, which manages taxes alongside other financial policies, released tax guidance updates that further clarify its stance on how businesses and individuals involved with cryptocurrency will be taxed.

Crypto is not money or currency

The guidelines set out HMRC’s view on cryptocurrency transactions, which taxes apply, how to file tax returns and accounting practices, among others. It also considers the taxation of exchange tokens, while stating that rules for utility or security tokens will be added in the future.

Companies that buy or sell tokens, mine, exchange tokens for other assets or provide goods or services in return for tokens are liable to pay for one or more different types of tax. Those taxes include income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp taxes and National Insurance contributions.

The tax authority explicitly stated that it does not consider any of the current types of cryptocurrencies to be money or currency.

HMRC further recognized that the cryptocurrency sector is a fast-moving one and it will therefore look at the facts of each case separately and apply the relevant tax provisions according to what has actually taken place, rather than by relying on theory alone.

HMRC had previously considered cryptocurrency trading to be the same as gambling. However, the latest tax guidance update states that the agency does not consider the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies as such.

HMRC requests user data from cryptocurrency exchanges

In August, HMRC requested that cryptocurrency exchanges provide it with records of customers’ identities and transaction histories. The agency aimed to address the perceived problem of tax evasion on digital asset trading platforms. At the time, sources familiar with the matter said that HMRC only requested records from the last two to three years, meaning that early investors in the cryptocurrency space would not be affected.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-and-blockchain-news-from-brazil-oct-28-nov-3-in-review,"Brazil has seen another tumultuous week in the cryptocurrency industry, as the alleged pyramid scheme Atlas Quantum upsets it customers yet again, another six individuals linked to the Unick Forest crypto scheme are arrested, and the founder of A2 Trader challenges Brazilian regulators to shut down his trading website.

Here is the past week of cryptocurrency and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph Brasil.

Atlas Quantum upsets customers, as it buys BTC for $5,500 and resells for $11,710

The alleged pyramid scheme, Atlas Quantum, a Brazilian platform that claims to conduct Bitcoin (BTC) arbitration, has angered its customers yet again. This time clients are upset over the price difference in the 'withdrawal in reals' operation, suggested by the company's CEO, Rodrigo Marques, to solve the company’s problem of withdrawals.

The operation gained some popularity as several users sought to sell their BTC in order to save at least a part of their investment. However, the price difference has not pleased investors given that Marques had ensured that Atlas would not ""gain anything from the system.""

Apparently, the company sold Bitcoin from disgruntled users at a massively discounted price of $5,500 but resold the same coins for $11,710, more than 50% of the value offered to the company’s blocked customers. A client from Atlas Quantum came forward, saying “it is a pure scam.”

Another six individuals arrested in case of alleged crypto scheme Unick Forex

On Oct. 26, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that a federal court ordered the detention of another six individuals suspected of participating in the activities of Unick Forex, a company that is accused of several crimes, including money laundering, and being a cryptocurrency investment scheme. When arrested, these individuals will be joining nine other arrestees, including the president of the company Leidimar Lopes. The guarantor of Unick's investments, Fernando Marques Lusvarghi, is still at large.

Founder of A2 Trader challenges the CVM: “If I have to close the site I open another one.”

In September, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the Brazilian Securities Commission (CVM) started investigating the allegedly fraudulent activities of A2 Trader and its founder, Kleyton Alves Pinto. A2 Trader was accused of being a financial pyramid, driving Alves to recently claim that the CVM analysis is based on fake news.

Alves further stated that no government can touch the money of investors and that the sites that report complaints about A2 Trader do so because they are ""paid for it.” He added that if the CVM would proceed to shut down his trading website, he would just open another one, on servers abroad.

Genbit user goes to court to block the company's bank accounts

The Sao Paulo Court of Justice granted an urgent injunction to a client of crypto exchange GenBit to block the company's bank accounts. The client claims that it initiated the process because it was unable to recover his funds.

The lawsuit stated that the exchange is now suspended by the CVM as it is not authorized to offer investments.

Alleged pyramid scheme Midas Trend sponsors French soccer match

Even though its activities have been investigated by the Brazilian regulators, Midas Trend, which offers investment packages through Bitcoin and cryptocurrency operations, sponsored a French Premier League game at the end of October.

The alleged Bitcoin pyramid scheme sponsored the match between Lille Olympique Sporting Club Métropole and Football Club des Girondins de Bordeaux. In addition to billboard advertisements at the stadium, Midas Trend also had its logo worn on the shirts of the Lille soccer players. Midas Trend president Deivanir Santos said:

""This is our first kick-off, our idea is to break even borders and overcome all challenges. I am very happy with that.”

Meanwhile, Midas Trend customers have been complaining about the company on social networks, stating that the investment platform is inaccessible and that it is not possible to talk to the company.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitfinex-crypto-exchange-moves-15m-of-stablecoin-to-bitcoin-sidechain,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex moved 1 .561 million Tether (USDT) from the Omni Protocol to the Liquid Bitcoin (BTC) sidechain.

Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino announced the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin’s protocol swap on Twitter on Nov. 2.

The conversion increases the quantity of USDT available on the network after the stablecoin was first launched on the Liquid sidechain at the end of July. Ardoino said that the development will have a beneficial effect on the protocol:

“Liquid sidechain has now more liquidity for atomic swaps and cross-exchange arbitrage.”

A sidechain in rapid development

In July, Liquid developer Blockstream launched a new tool that allows users to execute atomic swaps for all assets supported by the Liquid network. In June 2015, Liquid added confidential transactions designed to improve Bitcoin’s user security by keeping sent amounts visible only to participants in the transaction, or other specified parties.

This summer, Blockstream CEO Adam Back announced that Bitcoin users could use the Lightning Network while sending coins on the Liquid sidechain.

In a recent interview, Back was optimistic about the future of Bitcoin sidechains. Back said that they will decrease the appeal of altcoins, as they will bring features of altcoin networks to Bitcoin.

Tether expands from the Omni protocol

Tether was originally developed to operate on the Omni layer of the Bitcoin protocol. Tether states that operating on Omni gives the asset the stability generally associated with Bitcoin.

Since its creation in 2014, Tether has added other transport protocols. The stablecoin is also available on the Ethereum blockchain, which makes it operational in smart contracts and apps on that network.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cred-merchant-solutions-to-help-unbanked-business-sectors/,"Cred Merchant Solutions to Help Unbanked Business Sectors

Cred Merchant Solutions has been unveiled in Emeryville during San Francisco Blockchain Week in an event hosting several California elected officials. The new point-of-sale system will help unbanked business sectors, such as California’s cannabis industry, accept crypto payments from customers and pay taxes.

Cred Merchant Solutions Debut

The Universal Protocol Alliance (UPA) and Cred have held a private event at the Ohana Cannabis Dispensary in Emeryville, California, on Wednesday, October 30 to celebrate San Francisco Blockchain Week.

Dan Schatt, Cred CEO and co-founder, unveiled during the event the new Cred Merchant Solutions, a point-of-sale handheld terminal that supports the unbanked, underbanked and poorly banked around the world. The Android-based terminal will be deployed to businesses at cost and help them quickly pay taxes, dramatically lower transaction fees and reinvest money back into the business.

Cred Merchant Solutions converts a customer’s payment in crypto that is then loaned out to businesses around the world, while merchants instantly get the cash sales equivalent and governments get their share of the taxes, Schatt explained to an audience of about 100 attendees at the event. The new system is said to be faster than Square, fairer than Visa and friendlier than Chase. With it, customers are able to pay the way they want, merchants can use it to earn, borrow and save, and local governments will receive real-time tax revenue.

Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Cred is a decentralized banking platform serving customers in 179 countries with over $300 million in lending capital. It offers interest rates on more than 30 crypto and fiat currencies through its partner network. Cred was founded by former Paypal veterans with the mission of allowing everyone to benefit from low-cost credit products.

The Universal Protocol Alliance is a group of like-minded cryptocurrency companies and blockchain organizations that want to connect different digital assets in a single network. The alliance members include Bittrex, Brave, Certik, Omisego, Blockchain at Berkeley, Uphold, and Cred. The group has issued the Universal Dollar (UPUSD), the first stablecoin to be listed on Uphold. Every UPUSD is backed by the U.S. dollar and coins are minted on-chain with every transaction written to Ethereum.

California to Lead US in Crypto Payments

Cred’s Taking Crypto to a New High event drew in local elected representatives, such as Emeryville Mayor Ally Medina, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín, and Berkeley Council member Ben Bartlett. This is because Cred Merchant Solutions will help support business sectors underserved by banks, like the $2 billion+ a year California cannabis industry.

U.S. federal banking regulations currently deem cannabis sales as illegal activities, which causes dispensaries to lack access to traditional banking and leaves them exposed to extra security risks. Despite this, the industry has continued to grow steadily and local companies need dependable access to financial services. In fact, sales in California represented about 34% of legal sales in the United States last year.

Cannabis stores in California sold about $2.5 billion worth of products in 2018 alone. This is compared to just $1.5 billion in Colorado’s cannabis market, $1 billion in Washington, and $0.6 billion in Oregon. The authorities have enjoyed the growth in the sector too as the first quarter of 2018 brought in $60.9 million of tax revenues, the second $80.2 million, the third $100.8, and the fourth $111.9 million. This tax revenue is only expected to increase as the cannabis market in California is projected to jump to $7.7 billion by 2022 due to the opening of the recreational market.

Berkeley’s Bartlett also announced that he’s sponsoring a city plan to let businesses deploy Cred Merchant Solutions for tax collections and that he will work to enact similar legislation statewide so that California serves as a harbinger for others on tackling the problem of cash-intensive businesses. “What’s missing is money. When 70% of these operators are unbanked, we’re missing the money,” Bartlett said. “One way we can ease the burden amongst these companies is to alleviate their burden, achieve safety, and receive tax revenue for the city.”

California is home to innovative startups, technology companies and many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and beyond. As such it should not be surprising that it will lead the adoption of cryptocurrency payments in the U.S. In September we reported that Bartlett became the first elected official to purchase cannabis using a digital asset. He utilized bitcoin cash (BCH) and Cred’s LBA token to facilitate the transaction at the Ohana Cannabis dispensary in Emeryville.

The recent bust of a worldwide international paedophile ring using Bitcoin payments highlighted one of the key fears surrounding crypto-currencies—their use by criminals.

Social networking giant Facebook is keen to get in on the act by launching a digital currency called Libra.

But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has aired his ongoing opposition to the move, saying many concerns remained unresolved, including ""the issue of money laundering"".

Despite tighter regulations and increased vigilance by the authorities, illegal activities related to virtual currencies remained ""significant"", Madeleine Kennedy, from the research firm Chainalysis, told AFP.

1% of transactions illegal

A Chainalysis report published in January said that in 2018, one percent of Bitcoin transactions—the most widely used cryptocurrency—involved illegal activities.

The equivalent of $600 million was also spent using Bitcoins on the dark web, a set of hidden networks where a multitude of illicit products, including weapons and drugs, are traded.

In comparison, the global turnover of drug trafficking is estimated at several hundred billion dollars.

Kennedy believes the use of Bitcoins for criminal purposes was partly based on a ""misunderstanding"".

The confidentiality reputation of the most famous cryptocurrency is unrivalled, with all transactions recorded in an unforgeable public ledger, the blockchain.

But it is ""more transparent than some traditional financial systems and certainly more than cash"", she added.

Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg has tried to shield Libra from the crypto controversy

The British and US authorities last week announced more than 300 arrests in 38 countries as part of an investigation that led to the dismantling of an unprecedented child pornography ring.

Investigators analysed the blockchain and succeeded in ""de-anonymising Bitcoin transactions,"" according to Ron Fort, the head of criminal investigations in the US tax services.

Concerns about Monero

But if Bitcoin is still the reference currency for criminals because of its popularity, they are turning to less transparent alternatives, such as Monero, which began life in in 2014, according to the European law enforcement agency Europol.

Monero's users can remain anonymous until they need to interact with a cryptomarketing platform or invest their funds with a ""wallet""—the equivalent of an account for virtual currencies.

It is phenomenon that also worries the German finance ministry, which recently published a document warning that anonymous cryptos could become ""a real alternative to Bitcoin"".

Monero, whose capitalisation is still 160 times lower than Bitcoin, uses a complex architecture that makes transactions ""much more difficult to track"", said Kennedy.

""But no more than the many shell companies in the many tax havens,"" said Emilien Bernard-Alzias, a lawyer at Simmons & Simmons, a specialist in financial markets.

""We have always seen both legal and technical arrangements to conceal money transfers from the courts,"" he told AFP, adding that only cash can be considered ""perfectly untraceable"".

Also, since Monero does not allow large quantities of money to be bought, criminals are encouraged to convert their funds and must therefore use service providers subject to anti-money laundering regulations.

Unlike currencies that have made anonymity a marketing feature, Facebook has repeatedly said in recent months that Libra will be transparent and comply with the authorities' requirements.

Libra ""will clearly not be ideal for laundering dirty money"", said Bernard-Alzias, although it will probably need to use blockchain analysts ""to satisfy regulators"", added Kennedy.

In early September, the high-profile court case Kleiman v. Wright looked as though it was coming to an end as the two parties reached a non-binding settlement. Then on October 30, without much notice, Wright explained that he couldn’t finance the settlement and the agreement was broken. Now the trial will start again and the Kleiman estate hopes to depose Wright’s former chief financial officer, James Wilson on November 8.

Wright Breaks the Non-Binding Settlement as the Billion Dollar Bitcoin Lawsuit Continues

Australian native Craig Wright, the man who claims to be Bitcoin’s inventor, will be seeing more court proceedings in the near future as the notorious Kleiman v. Wright case is back on. Craig Wright is being sued by Ira Kleiman, the brother of the now-deceased David Kleiman, for allegedly interfering with David’s bitcoin assets and intellectual property after he died. Last September, news.Bitcoin.com reported on how the two parties were seemingly headed toward a settlement as both legal teams came to a non-binding settlement. This happened after the judge ruled the Kleimans were to be awarded 50% of Wright’s alleged BTC holdings and 50% of his blockchain intellectual property (IP). However, the Kleiman estate has filed a new court document which details that “Craig could no longer finance the settlement and was “breaking” the non-binding settlement agreement.” So Roche Freedman LLP wrote in the filing that after a lot of “lost time” the team will be “shifting back into preparing for trial.”

Following the broken settlement, the law firm explained it was in contact with James Wilson, the chief financial officer (CFO) of Craig’s companies in 2012-2013. This period of time is when Dave Kleiman was still alive and Wright alleged that he sold Dave interest in his businesses in exchange for BTC. Although Wright’s legal team, Rivero Mestre LLP, came back five hours after the Kleiman estate requested permission to depose Wilson and informed the plaintiffs they would not consent to the deposition on November 8. Wright’s council said the team would need to consent to a video deposition at a later date.

“Due to the unexpected failure of settlement negotiations, and the soon approaching discovery cutoff, the parties are short on time,” Roche Freedman’s filing notes. “Mr. Wilson’s presence in the United States next week obviates the need for the parties to go through the legal, logistical, and expensive steps of securing a deposition in Australia. And while Craig won’t have been afforded a full 14-days notice, he has received 7-days notice.” The Kleiman estate’s court filing adds:

Importantly the fact that Craig doesn’t have 14-days notice of this deposition is a product of his own conduct. He asked the parties to pause the litigation process and concentrate on amicably resolving this dispute, only to pull his consent with no advance notice, without good cause, and at a time when it simply wasn’t possible to give him the full 14-days notice.

James Wilson and Cryptoloc Technology

According to the Twitter handle ‘Seeking Satoshi,’ James Wilson is a former business associate of Wright’s and co-patent holder. “So the court in Florida would like to have a chat with Jamie Wilson, one time CFO for one of Craig’s dodgy companies and co-patent holder for Cryptoloc. But what does the court want from Jamie?” Seeking Satoshi asked on Twitter. “Do they think Jamie can shed some light on Craig’s financial dealings with Dave? Or do they suspect that Dave was involved in the development of Jamie’s ‘Cryptoloc’ and may be owed some money for his hand in the IP behind it?” The researcher continued:

I doubt the court will uncover much from speaking with Jamie and I don’t think any IP, bitcoin or money will be found that belongs to Dave. At some point, the court will realise there is no Tulip trust and no bitcoin and that Craig has led everyone on a goose chase.

Wilson is also mentioned in a blog post called “From the Bygone Days of Yore — Part 1,” written by Wright in June. Wright stated at the time that he had video link meetings with “Jamie Wilson, Robert Urquhart, and Dave Kleiman” with lawyers present in 2012. Roche Freedman’s motion requests that the court allows them to depose Wilson on November 8 with the defense team present via video-link. According to the court documents, a trial is scheduled to start on March 30, 2020, depending on the proceedings.

Molt sells himself (and by extension his courses and BTC-branded bubbly) as “Co-founder of BitCoin” and “one of the few experts in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.” He also created something called the Satoshi School, with a website that states:

To see what Molt really means when he says “co-founder,” a Youtube interview with Steven Melnik sheds some light on the slippery language. “It is the magic about that people from all over the world had the same idea at this time,” Molt states of the pre-bitcoin era, affirming in the video that even people who were simply working toward the creation of digital money in general, are all “co-founders.” The interviewer aptly notes that just because some folks thought about ride sharing before Uber, they are not magically co-founders of the company.

Decried by the Boy Who Cried Wolf

Many in the space aren’t having Molt’s conveniently vague language and loud claims of owning 250,000 bitcoins, of course. At the recent WCC Vegas Blockchain Week event, Twitter user @KennethBosak, known in part for his 2018 video where he accosts two unsuspecting booth workers with all the charm of a botched root canal, pointed to Molt, filming and saying:

This guy right here, He’s not Satoshi. He’s telling people he’s [expletive] Satoshi … You don’t belong in the space. Get out.

Bosak claims “Nakamolto” was telling conference attendees he was Satoshi, but this has not been verified. Molt’s reaction to the challenge was to return verbal fire and then sneakily knock off Bosak’s hat. The exchange is childish and of the caliber one would expect from internet sensation seeking. The incident and ensuing attention were apparently enough to send Molt running from Twitter, though, as his account has since been deactivated.

The Satoshi LARP Parade Continues

The last “Satoshi” gave his big reveal back in August to quickly fizzled attention. Like Molt, like Craig Wright, and like so many other attention-seekers in the space, claims were made that Bitcoin had somehow lost its way and been corrupted by greed and lack of leadership. And of course, only the newly revealed Satoshi could fix this. Proof isn’t provided, however, and critique of this lack of evidence is often met with scandalized shouting and gaslighting. After all, what’s the fun of live-action role play if no one believes you?

The crypto space is difficult to navigate for dazzled newbies. Thanks to long strings of priming buzzwords like “blockchain” and purposefully vague language, understanding fundamentals becomes a challenge. Much like the televangelist’s insatiable need to talk about his private jet and gold-threaded suit — while making the congregation all too aware they might miss out on theirs — crypto cons similarly give themselves away. After all, nobody wants to miss out on bitcoin paradise, and a messiah complex goes a long way in selling the story. As for Molt, the veracity of his co-founder status claim, and how many will ultimately become disciples, remains to be seen.

The case resembles other recent high-profile heists in which a hacker seizes control of a victim’s cell phone to then loot online crypto accounts: the swap was from cellular carrier AT&T, money was taken from Bittrex, and the hack took control over the victim’s online identity.

The hack against Seattle-based angel investor Gregg Bennett, however, has not been resolved by criminal investigators, as others have before being made public in legal filings.

In this case, Bennett filed suit in Washington state’s King County Superior Court, alleging that Bittrex violated its own published security protocols and ignored industry standards, missing the chance to stop the high-stakes burglary. He also alleged that Bittrex failed to act as the April 15, 2019 hack was in process or respond quickly enough once notified by him directly.

The financial legal examiner for the Washington state regulator handling consumer complaints, the Department of Financial Institutions, concluded that Bittrex did not “take reasonable steps to respond” to Bennett’s notice and “appears” to have violated its own terms of service, in a signed letter dated Aug. 30, 2019 provided to CoinDesk by Bennett.

Though various legal entities were notified of the hack, they have not yet announced any criminal charges in the case, and as such, the whereabouts of Bennett’s bitcoin are unknown.

Bittrex’s response

Bittrex declined to comment specifically about the Bennett hack and the court case.

But CEO Bill Shihara, speaking to CoinDesk about other recent SIM hacks, said the exchange has robust security in place to prevent account breaches, including two-factor authentication and email verification when an unknown IP address logs into an account.

These “speed bumps” might result in some user complaints, he said, but “they actually save a lot of accounts from being hacked.”

But given a target’s email may also be breached, it’s best to never trust one’s phone as the last security stop – once it’s taken over, everything could be accessible, he said:

“I think this is a problem that requires a lot of solutions and a lot of layers of security. And unfortunately one of the mantras that we use and often publish articles about is that ultimately you can’t trust your phone. You have to be aware that you could lose control of your phone.”

AT&T’s role

Bennett told CoinDesk that he suspects his hack was “an inside job,” as he said that his account PIN and even Social Security number on the account were changed, which would imply that someone at the phone company played a role.

However, AT&T is not named in the Bennett suit, while it’s the focus of similar cases filed by Seth Shapiro and Michael Terpin.

While Bennett’s present case only focuses on the security lapses at Bittrex, he said the door remained open; AT&T “will not escape my wrath,” he said.

AT&T spokesman Jim Greer said he could only reiterate his prior responses to the SIM hacks: customers should avoid relying on their cell phones for security.

“Fraudulent SIM swaps are a form of theft committed by sophisticated criminals. We are working closely with our industry, law enforcement and consumers to stop and prevent this type of crime,” Greer said.

Red flags

Bennett says that Bittrex should have known something odd was afoot.

The hacks were coming from a Florida IP address and from an NT operating system, he said, neither of which he had never before used – both signs, in his mind, that it should be clear that he was not the one accessing the account.

Bennett alleges in the lawsuit that the hackers ultimately drained 100 bitcoin from his account – the maximum daily withdrawal allowed. In fact, he had a series of coins that the hackers dumped at below-market prices, converted into a further 30 bitcoin and made off with.

They even returned the following day for his 35 remaining bitcoin, but by that time, Bennett said he had succeeded in getting Bittrex to shut down the account and the unauthorized withdrawals.

Bennett’s suit alleges Bittrex failed to follow industry security standards in his case.

Beyond the different IP address and operating system, his lawyers asserted that Bittrex should have also imposed a 24-hour withdrawal hold after password changes, which he said other exchanges do.

“What I fault Bittrex for is their inability to see obvious suspicious activity,” Bennett said.

""We map this data across both blockchains and find that the one player or entity (labeled as 1LSg throughout the paper) is behind the majority of the patterns we document.""

Finance professors John Griffin and Amin Shams – instructors at University of Texas and the Ohio State University, respectively – analyzed over 200 gigabytes of data for the transaction history between bitcoin and tether, another digital currency. Tether is an asset known as a ""stablecoin,"" which has its trading value connected to the dollar.

A forensic study on bitcoin's 2017 boom has found that nearly the entire rise of the digital currency at the time is attributable to ""one large player,"" although the market manipulator remains unidentified.

Griffin and Shams were able to follow the clusters of data to a source: ""One large account at Bitfinex."" The digital currency exchange Bitfinex is one of the largest in the world. The study found that, through Bitfinex, the single player was able to manipulate demand for bitcoin via ""extreme"" flows of tethers. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the updated study's results on Monday.

The manipulation occurred as bitcoin rose to an all-time high of nearly $20,000 in late 2017, the study found. Bitcoin traded at about $9,300 on Monday.

""One of the SEC's top worries is that crypto is subject to manipulation. This study appears to lend credibility to that argument,"" Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a note on Monday.

The study comes after an analysis published in March found that 95% bitcoin spot trading is faked. The survey, created by cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise for the SEC, found that only $273 million of about $6 billion in average daily bitcoin volume was legitimate.

Cowen said Griffin and Shams' study will likely add even more scrutiny of bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large, especially from regulators and lawmakers.

""We see this as further souring Washington on crypto and believe it is negative for efforts to launch crypto ETFs and for Facebook to launch Libra,"" Seiberg added.

Libra is Facebook's cryptocurrency project, which has seen several major backers drop out in the past month.

While the latest study doesn't identify the manipulator, the professors suggest those running Bitfinex either knew of the operation or were even possibly assisting the scheme. Bitfinex's general counsel Stuart Hoegner told the WSJ that the study ""lacks academic rigor,"" saying that ""it is the global rise of digital currency that has driven the market's demand for tether.""

Both Bitfinex and Tether Ltd., the company that controls tether, are owned and operated by the same people. The WSJ noted that both companies are under investigations for alleged fraud by the Department of Justice and the New York Attorney General.

The price action of assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even traditional assets like stocks or commodities, are driven by a complex balance of supply and demand, but also the psychology of each market’s participants.

A comparison between the late 1990s and early 2000s dot com era boom and the late 2017 crypto hype bubble show just how similar human psychology playing out in markets can be, and potentially offer a glimpse into Bitcoin’s long-term future.

Market Psychology Compared: Crypto Versus Dot Com Bubble

It’s not uncommon to see today’s crypto market compared to the dot com bubble of the early 2000s. Both were emerging technologies that offered untapped potential and promise and took the entire world by storm.

Investors flocked to budding brands harnessing the power of the new internet technology in droves, driving up the price of stocks like Amazon long before the online bookstore became the wide-ranging digital brand it is today.

In a comparison against Bitcoin, Amazon’s stock performance during the dot com bubble shows a similar market structure – one that is highly driven by speculation and therefore, the emotional and psychological state of investors.

Markets peak around periods of extreme euphoria, and once investors come down to reality form the high they were riding, oftentimes fear, anger, and even depression take over. All this before a long, drawn-out return to mean.

The charts shared demonstrate that human psychology rarely changes, and thus, markets typically behave in similar manners. As is the case with Amazon, so long as the underlying asset still has value, after a long period of consolidation, the asset can go on to rally once again, making the initial peak look like a mere blip on a price chart.

Amazon: A Glimpse Into Bitcoin’s Future?

Very few Bitcoin investors are buying up the scarce digital asset for what it can currently do, and instead, are speculating on its long-term potential to disrupt the financial industry and potentially replace the world’s fiat currency.

The same was true during the early days of the internet, during the dot com boom. Internet companies were a dime a dozen, each offering promise of future breakthroughs in technologies and user experiences.

The majority of the companies, however, died during the collapse after the dot com bubble popped, and from the ashes rose today’s giants like Amazon. But even Amazon was once nothing more than a bookstore, and not the digital powerhouse that it is today.

According to data, if Bitcoin follows the same pace as internet adoption, 50% of the world’s population will be using the cryptocurrency in some way.

At one point, the internet – like Bitcoin – was considered a fad. And although Amazon’s stock price crashed following the bubble pop, it went on to bring even invests who bought the absolute top of the dot com peak over 1669% returns at the recent highs set over the past year.

And just like the dot com bubble, many projects will die along the way, but those that offer real value will eventually grow to become the Amazon’s of the space.",2019-11-04 19:00:52+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sim-swap-victim-sues-crypto-exchange-bittrex-for-1m-bitcoin-theft,"Gregg Bennett, a SIM-swap hack victim and angel investor, sued cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex over allegedly allowing the theft of nearly $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC).

According to a press release published on Oct. 30, Bennett believes the exchange violated its own security standards and allowed hackers to steal his cryptocurrency in April. The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, suggests that the exchange committed “unfair and deceptive acts that misrepresented its level of security.""

A SIM-swapping attack

The hackers reportedly took control of Bennett’s mobile number and then used it to access his online accounts, including Bittrex, on April 15. The cybercriminals then allegedly sold the Bitcoin for other crypto assets at below-market prices and transferred the funds to an account under their control.

Bennett claims that he realized that he was under attack, but the exchange failed to react for nearly two hours, which allegedly allowed the attackers to steal his funds. Per the release, the hackers tried to withdraw more funds, but by then the exchange had already reacted to Bennett’s emails — the only way the exchange can be contacted, according to the lawsuit.

Red flags allegedly ignored

Dan Kittle, who works at Lane Powell — the law firm representing Bennett — said:

“As alleged in our complaint, Bittrex ignored a number of red flags warning Bittrex that the person initiating the withdrawal was not Gregg Bennett. [...] We plan to show in court that Bittrex either ignored or was unaware of standard industry safeguards to prevent hacks just like this.”

The exchange reportedly ignored that the hacker used a different operating system and a suspicious IP address. Furthermore, the exchange allegedly did not impose a 24-hour hold period on the account’s funds after the password change. Bennett commented:

“Bittrex was bamboozled by hackers who should have been as visible as thieves wearing masks and carrying guns. [...] I am asking for Bittrex to do the right thing by plugging what I see as gaping holes in their approach to security, and to return my coin to me.”

Bennett also explained that Bittrex and its owner Bill Shihara were difficult to convince that he was actually hacked, stating:

“I am going to do everything I can to hold those responsible accountable for their actions, so other people aren’t victims of similar negligence.”

As Cointelegraph reported last month, SIM swapping victim Michael Terpin wrote an open letter to the United States Federal Communication Commission Chairman Ajit Pai requesting action to render such attacks impossible in the future.",,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/einstein-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-complaints-1.5347104,"Under a cloud of complaints, investigations and lawsuits, a controversial Vancouver cryptocurrency exchange has shut its doors with more than $16 million owing to customers.

The B.C. Securities Commission (BCSC) obtained an order last week appointing an interim receiver to oversee the Einstein Exchange, after filing a petition in B.C. Supreme Court claiming exchange founder Michael Ongun Gokturk could not be reached.

BCSC executive director Peter Brady told CBC News the commission has also notified the RCMP of concerns about possible money laundering raised by a former exchange employee.

""We received a number of complaints from customers of the exchange being unable to access their assets. We had sent some requests for information to the exchange twice and we didn't get an answer,"" said Brady.

""We were then talking to the company's counsel and learned that the exchange intended to shut down within 30 to 60 days due to a lack of profit and subsequently that legal counsel stepped down, so that raised concerns for us.""

Einstein Exchange claimed in court documents it had ""sufficient crypto assets to satisfy withdrawal requests from customers.""

But the BCSC claimed the exchange's lawyers refused to specify the location of those assets.

The Einstein Exchange has shut its doors amid numerous complaints and concerns raised to the commission about money laundering. (Yvette Brend/CBC)

In an affidavit, BCSC investigator Sammy Wu said he believes ""Einstein improperly used their customers' assets.""

Wu said commission staff determined that the company owes customers more than $16.3 million — including more than $11 million in cryptocurrencies and about $5 million in cash.

Wu said he went to the Einstein Exchange office last Friday and ""discovered that the elevator is locked for all floors.""

""I called Gokturk's phone number listed on their website and the recording said all their agents are not available,"" Wu's affidavit said.

""I called Gokturk and his voice mail said that he is unavailable and to send a text message since he does not check voice mail.""

Gokturk spoke to the CBC in January 2018 about a storm of online criticism that accompanied the opening of the exchange. Customers claimed that staff were slow to respond and expressed fear they might lose their money.

At the time, Gokturk claimed his team was overwhelmed by response and demand for digital currency and promised that ""no one will lose their money here.""

The company's website has been taken down but the Einstein Exchange Facebook page is still online. The page features many posts from customers demanding their money and warning others about problems.

On Facebook the company warned its customers about posting their information online because ""we have been receiving many complaints that scammers have been targeting Einstein customers who have posted their account emails publicly.""

In addition to multiple customer complaints, the Einstein Exchange is also facing a pair of civil suits filed last month in relation to the transfer of cryptocurrency.

Hong Kong-based Sino Allied filed a notice of civil claim claiming it was still owed $1 million US after Einstein agreed to buy a form of currency named Tether.

And two weeks ago, Vancouver technology entrepreneur Scott Nelson sued Gokturk after claiming he had transferred 50 Bitcoin — equivalent to $535,000 — without receiving any money in return.

Nelson claimed Gokturk told him he would wire the money, but ""repeatedly blamed technical issues for the failure."" Nelson said Gokturk then told him he would give him a bank draft, but none was ever delivered.

Gokturk has not filed responses to either of those lawsuits.

A default judgment was also issued last April against Gokturk and Einstein Exchange in relation to $116,789.62 owed on an American Express credit card.

The CBC was unable to reach Gokturk for comment.

Brady said the BCSC has warned investors to exercise caution when dealing with platforms that deal in cryptoassets because they tend to be higher risk.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/04/bitcoin-mining-sucking-georgia-power-grid-dry/,"Bitcoin BTC mining in the Eurasian country of Georgia is reportedly “sucking its power grid dry,” but it doesn’t matter because the country has reserves of hydroelectric power.

According to BBC Sounds podcast, Business Daily, Georgia is now the world’s third largest miner of Bitcoin, behind China and Venezuela.

However, it’s not good news for some. David Chapashvili from Green Energy, an environmental pressure group, criticizes the practice for how much electricity it consumes.

Bitcoin mining is Guzzling up electricity

Documents shown to Business Daily by the environmental group report that one Bitfury-owned Bitcoin mining farm is “guzzling” up 4 percent of the country’s electricity. That’s more than 389 million kilowatt hours in raw numbers.

But this is just one factory. Chapashvili says the country actually has no understanding of the total impact cryptocurrency mining is having on Georgia’s energy consumption.

“There are lots of micro-miners,” he said. “If you ask a very simple question to the ministry like which sector is consuming [energy] Georgia doesn’t have this kind of analysis.”

“Actually, in reality we don’t know what’s going on or how many consumers are [mining Bitcoin],” Chapashvili added.

The environmental pressure group estimates that Bitcoin mining is using more than 10 percent of the country’s energy supplies.

However, representatives from Bitfury say its energy use isn’t much if you compare it to the energy required to mine conventional precious metal mining.

But it’s a kind of non-issue.

Most of Georgia is actually powered by renewable energy. According to statistics from the International Energy Agency (IEA), more than 80 percent of the country’s energy comes from hydro power.

There’s also an energy surplus in the country, so it could be argued that it doesn’t really matter hat Bitcoin mining uses so much of its power.

Credit: IEA Electricity generation by source in Georgia from 1990 to 2017

What’s more, according to government sustainable development group Invest In Georgia, the country is only exploiting 25 percent of its potential when it comes to renewable energy production.

Bitfury even says the presence of cryptocurrency miners in the country is actually driving support for renewable energy.

Placing mining centers next to hydroelectric plants to consume the surplus of renewable energy actually puts the power to good use. Meanwhile, the country can develop the infrastructure required to take advantage of it.

If anything, it’s a good thing that Bitcoin miners are utilizing the green, hydroelectric power. It’s turning what would be otherwise unused, surplus energy into a transferable store of value that can move around the world.

Bitcoin is often criticized for its energy use. The Bitcoin network’s total power consumption is often compared to that of entire countries, like Austria. The important question to ask though, is: Where does that energy come from?",2019-11-04,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-winter-claims-another-victim-as-dx-exchange-closes/,"Crypto Winter Claims Another Victim as DX Exchange Closes

DX Exchange Is Looking for a Buyer

Estonia-based digital assets trading venue DX Exchange has announced that as of Sunday, November 3, the platform is not allowing any more deposits from clients, trading is suspended and all open orders have been canceled. This is done to close the exchange until a new buyer can be found for the company. Alternatively, DX may merge with another exchange to reduce the high cost of running the business. The company also reassured clients that all their funds are safe and need to be returned to allow a merger or a sale to proceed.

“We must inform the community that the board of directors of DX.Exchange has decided to temporarily close the exchange as we pursue a merger or outright sell of the company,” the team wrote in a blog post. “The cost of providing the required level of security, support and technology is not economically feasible on our own. The board believes this is the best opportunity for DX.Exchange to achieve success for its shareholders and compete in this challenging market. In the event a merger or sell is not completed in a timely manner then the exchange may not resume operations and take appropriate action.”

Smaller crypto exchanges find it difficult to survive in the current market as they have to spend a lot of money to comply with new regulations and compete with giants such as Binance. However, many other types of ventures in the digital assets industry are suffering too. Just recently we reported that Platin, a secure Proof of Location protocol which incentivizes nodes at scale by means of its own blockchain-based token, shut down on Nov. 1, 2019, despite all the recognition it got over the last two years.

Tokenized Stocks, ETFs and Crypto

DX Exchange was only launched on Jan. 7, 2019. It accepted deposits in BCH, BTC, ETH, USDT, DASH, LTC, XRP, and a few other cryptocurrencies as well as traditional fiat payment options. It initially offered trading on the tokenized stocks of some of the biggest public companies in the world, such as Google, Facebook and Amazon. This had been achieved through an agreement with MPS Marketplace Securities Ltd., which issued tokens that represent stocks via smart contracts and held the real world stocks according to demand on the platform.

The “digital stocks” were said to be backed 1:1 with the real-world stocks traded on conventional stock exchanges, like stablecoins backed by equities rather than fiat. Unlike traditional stock exchanges, this arrangement allowed the platform to offer its users the ability to trade on stocks 24/7.

DX Exchange holds operating licenses from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit and reportedly employed over 70 developers in an R&D center in Israel. It is backed by NFX, a seed and series A focused venture capital firm based in San Francisco. The regulated platform operated in full compliance with Mifid II (the latest EU financial regulations), which means it featured a robust AML/KYC process. Its partner, MPS Marketplace Securities Ltd. is a Cyprus-licensed financial company which provides liquidity solutions for the online trading market.

The technology powering DX Exchange is built on Nasdaq’s Financial Information exchange (FIX), a vendor-neutral standard message protocol that defines an electronic message exchange for communicating securities transactions between two parties. The platform also supported trading via an API, which means it can be easily integrated with market makers, liquidity providers, algo traders, and hedge funds.

In early March, it was reported that DX Exchange began offering trading on tokenized exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including Nasdaq-mirrored QQQ, S&Ps and SPY. Later that month, it was also revealed that the platform was starting to list security token offerings (STOs).

Any security token could submit an application to be listed and needed to meet eligibility requirements for listing on the exchange. The potential issuers were evaluated according to their achievements, transparency, fundraising method, and management team. DX also required a legal opinion which supports the STO’s legitimacy and performed background checks on the management team and directors. For each security token which was offered, a whitepaper explaining the conditions, economic benefits and risks was required.

Bitcoin seeks to break out of trading range

Data from Coin360 reveals BTC/USD tackling $9,300 on Monday, rising to a 24-hour high of $9,310 on exchanges after dipping as low as $9,080.

The latest action continues the weekly trend for Bitcoin, which has seen the largest cryptocurrency range between just under $9,000 and just over $9,500. Those levels effectively formed support and resistance, respectively.

Now, analysts are turning their attention to the required conditions for a more purposeful breakout — either up or down.

Willy Woo: CME gap likely to be filled

According to statistician Willy Woo, the coming few months for Bitcoin will first see a dip to $8,600, filling in a gap in futures markets.

Thereafter, bullish action should begin to surface. Bitcoin needs a monthly close above $14,000 in order to then secure a longer-term bull market.

“Once we get a monthly close above $14k, we'll be in the second phase of the bull market; a steady, lowish volatility, run in price. Should happen by the start of 2020, that's the best time to deploy capital,” he summarized in a series of tweets on Monday.

As Cointelegraph reported, Woo is not alone in forecasting a short-term slide for BTC/USD. Last week, regular contributor filbfilb also eyed the potential for the pair to revisit the $8,000 bracket.

In an update on his dedicated Telegram trading channel on Sunday, he continued the narrative:

“Suspect there are a lot of over leveraged people in the 9300s with stops below 9k. Whales probably tempted to dump it and get a lower entry.”

Altcoin markets see green

Altcoins meanwhile took the chance to deliver moderate gains in line with Bitcoin’s slight uptick.

Out of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, many rose by up to 4% on the day, with only Bitcoin SV (BSV) seeing losses of 1.6%.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, saw gains of 1.7% to trade $184. Both NEO (NEO) and Litecoin (LTC) performed strongly, with 4.5% advances.

The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $247 billion at press time, with Bitcoin’s share at 67.3%.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ethereum-eth-eyes-fresh-rally-to-200-bitcoin-up-3/,"Ethereum price is rising and it broke the key $185 and $186 resistance levels against the US Dollar.

Bitcoin is up around 3% and it managed to climb above the $9,400 resistance.

There is a new bullish trend line forming with support near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).

The pair remains supported on dips and it could continue to rise towards the $200 level in the near term.

Ethereum price is slowly climbing higher versus the US Dollar, similar to bitcoin. ETH price is likely to rise towards the $200 level as long as above $182.

Ethereum Price Analysis

After forming a support base near $180, Ethereum started a steady rise above $182 against the US Dollar. ETH price recovered and broke a strong resistance near the $185 and $186 levels.

Moreover, there was a close above the $185 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. During the rise, there was a break above yesterday’s highlighted bearish trend line with resistance near $182.

Finally, the price tested the $190 resistance area and it is currently correcting lower. There was a break below the $188 level, plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $179 swing low to $189 swing high.

However, the previous resistance near the $185 area is now acting as a decent support. More importantly, there is a new bullish trend line forming with support near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $179 swing low to $189 swing high is also near the trend line to provide support. The main support is near the $182 level since it coincides with the 100 hourly SMA.

If Ethereum breaks the trend line and trades below $182, it could move back into a bearish zone. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $190 level. If there is a proper break above $190, the price could start an increase towards the main $200 resistance area.

Looking at the chart, Ethereum price is showing a few positive signs above the $185 support area. Having said that, the path towards the $200 barrier won’t be easy. If the bulls struggle to clear the $190 and $192 resistance levels, there could be a bearish reaction below the $185 support. In the mentioned case, the $182 support holds the key.

Market watchdogs have been debating whether and how they should regulate the cryptocurrency industry since Facebook’s plans to launch its Libra digital currency caused many of them to broaden their focus on digital assets beyond investor protection concerns.

Hong Kong hosts dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges, also called virtual asset trading platforms, including some of the world’s largest.

Ashley Alder, chief executive of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said such exchanges had largely escaped regulation until now because most of the virtual assets traded on their platforms were not technically securities.

“After an in-depth examination of their unique technical and operational features, we concluded that some could be regulated by us,” Alder said in a speech before the SFC published its new regulations.

Some cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong and elsewhere say they welcome regulation as it would boost standards and allow licensed exchanges to differentiate themselves from unlicensed competitors. Others prefer to operate further under the radar.

NEW FRAMEWORK

The new rules, under which exchanges can apply to be regulated from Wednesday, draw on the standards the SFC expects for conventional securities brokers.

They stipulate that an exchange that wants to be licensed must provide services to professional investors only, have an insurance policy to protect clients in case assets are lost or stolen, and use an external market surveillance mechanism.

Cryptocurrency exchanges do not need an SFC license to operate provided they do not trade any products defined as a security. Bitcoin for example is not a security, Alder said.

Bringing all exchanges under the SFC’s wing would require new legislation. It is not yet clear how many cryptocurrency exchanges will apply for a license or meet its standards.

Last year, Alder announced a new framework that would allow asset managers investing in digital assets and selling products in Hong Kong to receive an SFC license. Hardly any have been able to meet the SFC’s requirements.

In a separate statement on Wednesday, the SFC warned investors about purchasing bitcoin futures in Hong Kong. Alder said in his speech that exchanges allowing trading of such products “may well be conducting an illegal activity”.",2019-11-06 06:24:12+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-captured-90-of-octobers-crypto-spending-in-australia/,"Bitcoin Cash Captured 90% of October's Crypto Spending in Australia

Just recently the web portal Bitcoinbch.com reported that the number of bitcoin cash (BCH) Australian retail transactions throughout the month of September outshined every other digital currency by a wide margin. After the study, the researchers analyzed transactions for the month of October and once again BCH overshadowed the competitors when it comes to retail spending.

October’s Australian Crypto Retail Data

Bitcoin Cash supporters take pride in merchant adoption and the great utility behind a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Throughout the world, there are a number of countries that have seen widespread BCH adoption like Japan and Slovenia. Another country that sees a significant amount of BCH usage is Australia, and a good number of merchants stem from the North Queensland region. Across the entire country there’s a total of 197 BCH accepting merchants in Australia according to map.Bitcoin.com’s merchant page. Bitcoinbch.com’s last report, covering the month of September, had shown that BCH accounted for more than 92% of the total amount of cryptocurrency expenditure in the country between two payment processors Travelbybit (TBB) and Hula (Hockings Underwriting Logistics App).

The numbers have been tallied again, but this time covering the month of October and BCH outpaced the competition by a landslide. “Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is by far the most useful cryptocurrency with Australian retailers — Bitcoin Cash [has trounced] all other cryptocurrencies combined with a staggering $19,450 (90.74%) of the total October cryptocurrency retail spend,” the study explains. “The data indicates a collapse in retail sales for most of the minor coins: LN shrank from $1,224 in September to $941 in October, BNB shrank from $913 to $457 and BTC from $744 to just $251.” Further, the number of BCH retail transactions in October combined was roughly 264 transactions or about 75% in Australia. Lightning Network (LN) saw about 50 transactions (14.2%) combined with BTC’s 16 onchain transactions making a total of 18.8%.

The Travelbybit point-of-sale (PoS) processor also saw a decline in market share as well, dropping from September’s $3,737 to only $2,041 in October. “[The underwriting firm] Hula is in effect amplifying BCH circulation by reducing the time it takes to put coins back into the community,” the report details. “In contrast, the Travelbybit PoS has the double disadvantage of both instantly extracting supported coins from the community and lowering the density of adoption with their policy of hosting multiple coins.” The report adds:

Australian retail data is indicating that, in order to compete with the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) juggernaut, other cryptocurrencies are best to go it alone – they are advised to win over merchants directly to their coin and avoid multi-coin PoS systems altogether.

The study concludes that retail cryptocurrency usage in Australia is primarily bitcoin cash transactions and utility is bolstered when the system is focused on a single cryptocurrency. The effects are amplified with circulation and regions like Bitcoin Cash City showcase how network effects spread.

The researchers further stress that BCH is “firmly entrenched in Australia and will be virtually impossible to dislodge.” The name of the game is for BCH to ultimately disrupt the market share of fiat systems and foster billions of users in the future. “Upcoming improvements targeting compliance, along with major projects, will likely allow further BCH penetration into the Australian economy,” the end of the Bitcoinbch.com report underscored.

A four-month falling trendline proved a tough nut to crack during the Asian trading hours and reversed bitcoin’s rise from $9,200 to $9,500. The outlook, however, would turn bearish only below the 200-day average support at $9,127.

The pullback from $9,500 to $9,200 lacked volume support and could be short-lived.

A high-volume UTC close above $9,470 is needed to confirm an upside break of the multi-month falling trendline and open the doors for $13,880 (2019 high).

Acceptance below the 200-day MA would weaken the immediate bullish. The resulting sell-off to $8,500, if any, will likely be transient.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) struggle for a bullish breakout continues with a falling trendline capping gains for the fifth time in 11 days.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading in the red near $9,300 on Bitstamp, having faced rejection near $9,470 – the resistance of the trendline connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 highs – during the Asian trading hours.

The four-month trendline sloping downwards from the 2019 high of $13,880 first came into play on Oct. 26. On that day, prices clocked a high of $10,350 but failed to print a UTC close above the resistance line.

Similar price action was seen on the following two days and on Monday when prices rose from $9,200 to a one-week high of $9,586 but failed to beat the trendline hurdle.

The repeated failure to scale the multi-month downtrend line may force some investors to question the sustainability of the recent rise from five-month lows below $7,500.

However, such fears may be premature, as prices are still holding above the 200-day MA support, a barometer of long-term market trends, as seen in the chart below.

Daily chart

BTC is again struggling to get past the descending trendline, currently at $9,470. Even so, it is early to call a bearish reversal, as the 200-day MA support at $9,127 is intact.

The average has been restricting downside since Oct. 30, having worked as resistance multiple times in the 16 days to Oct. 11.

All-in-all, BTC is being squeezed between the long-term average support and the falling trendline resistance.

A high-volume UTC close above $9,470 is needed to confirm an upside break of the falling trendline. That would imply a resumption of the bull market from lows near $4,100 seen at the beginning of April and open the doors for resistance at $13,880.

On the downside, acceptance below the long-held 200-day MA support at $9,127 will likely invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a drop to $8,500.

A bullish breakout looks likely, as the cryptocurrency tends to pick up a strong bid six months ahead of reward halving, as discussed last week.

Note that the recent pullback from $10,350 lacked volume support. Essentially, it represents a bull breather and could be reversed.

Hourly chart

BTC jumped from $9,273 to $9,586 in the 60 minutes to 22:00 UTC on Monday with buying volume (green bar) hitting the highest level since Oct. 31.

Indeed, the spike has been erased with prices falling to $9,165 a few hours ago but with weak trading volumes. Therefore, the possibility of BTC rising back to highs near $9,600 cannot be ruled out.

In a tweet on Nov. 2, Schiff, notorious for his cynicism when it comes to Bitcoin, attempted to counter criticism of his stance by Keiser report host, Max Keiser.

Schiff tells Keiser: gold backing beats BTC

“According to @maxkeiser I'm an idiot because I think #gold is better money than #Bitcoin,” he wrote.

Schiff also repeated his oft-quoted idea that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value:

“He also claims China is about to launch a crypto currency backed by gold. This is bullish for gold and bearish for Bitcoin. A crypto backed by gold is much better than one backed by nothing!”

Keiser did not respond publicly, having kept a markedly low profile on social media throughout October.

Official hints at gold role

As Cointelegraph reported, China appears to be advancing efforts to issue a digital currency in the wake of Facebook’s own token, Libra.

Its backing remains uncertain, with an ex-Congress official last month suggesting it would come in the form of a peg to China’s gold reserve among other factors.

China’s recent endorsement of blockchain technology meanwhile appeared to have an instant positive impact on Bitcoin markets. Nonetheless, local media subsequently tempered the hype, advising citizens not to take the support as proof of a change of stance regarding cryptocurrency.

Argentina’s government is imposing stricter measures to prevent access to foreign exchange reserves. As a result, Bitcoin price on one of the country’s local exchanges is currently trading at a 25 percent premium.



Trading Jobs Cut Boosts Bitcoin Price

Shifting politics, economic uncertainty, and stricter forex controls have led Argentine banks to eliminate trading desk jobs. According to the Buenos Aires Times,

Banks started by cutting senior roles amid concerns on their budgets for the year ahead and that a Fernández government may put limits on layoffs. Among the biggest blows to the sector were delays on the payment of local notes and FX controls, which limit banks’ ability to trade futures.

The economic turmoil is having a significant effect on the cryptocurrency market, namely Bitcoin price. Consequently, Argentine traders are paying over 25 percent for the main cryptocurrency. Specifically, as of this writing, Ripio, one of the main local crypto exchanges, is showing Bitcoin price at ARS 691454.97, which is around $11,600.

Earlier today however, a redditor posted Bitcoin price on the exchange broke as high as $12,759 – representing a 38% premium compared to other global exchanges.

Incoming Administration Supports Latest Forex Controls

The economic situation in Argentina is becoming increasingly precarious. According to data from the World Bank, the local currency devalued significantly in 2019. Annual inflation reached over 50%, while the GDP contracted 2.5% in 2018, and another 2.5% in the first six months of 2019.

Some observers suggest that Argentina, one of the largest Latin American economies, might be heading towards another economic crisis. And, to avert the crisis, the administration of the outgoing President Macri is imposing stricter protectionist controls. The Wall Street Journal explains,

To make up the difference, Argentina often prints money that fuels inflation or borrows dollars from abroad or both. Because it is a protectionist economy closed to free trade and riddled with inefficient companies, it struggles to generate enough dollars through exports to pay its dollar debts.

Before leaving the presidency, Macri is taking last-minute measures to stave off the looming financial crisis. One of them is hardening foreign currency restrictions. Indeed, the latest control imposed by the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) forbids Argentines to purchase more than $200 a month.

These measures are likely to be maintained by the new administration to be headed by Alberto Fernandez, who will take office on December 10, 2019. Indeed, according to La Nación, Fernandez approves of the latest economic measures that the outgoing administration is imposing.

Secularization is the process of converting something from a religious status to a nonreligious one. In its usage here, the word “religious” has no necessary connection to a deity. The word refers to the mystification of a thing in order to elevate it to the status of the divine where it becomes unquestionable.

Mystifying Money

The state is mystification on overdrive. Past governments have sanctified themselves through “the divine right of kings,” by which monarchs claimed to be chosen by God to rule. Rebellion against the king, therefore, was rebellion against God himself. Contemporary states use more modern concepts like “democracy” or “the motherland” to justify their status. These concepts arouse feelings of awe and reverence, which further sanctifies the state and discourages dissent.

The state’s goal is to usurp power and wealth from society—the productive sector.

Taxation is the most visible way it does so, but the state’s ability to issue fiat that becomes mandatory currency is equally or more important. To do so successfully, however, the state needs society to accept and use the paper money. Some people will comply out of fear of being punished, but it is far more efficient if society conflates fiat with real wealth. If fiat can be mystified as legitimate, then the resistance is sidestepped.

Much of fiat’s perceived legitimacy comes from its source—the state—because the state is still seen as a rightful authority. Fiat is further cemented into society through state-validated means like legal tender laws and the Federal Reserve System. “High finance” is removed from average, unlicensed people and channeled through bureaucracies like the SEC and the central banking system. And, in case some people still question, tax-paid academics and experts provide the state with intellectual ammunition. Like court historians of the past who rewrote history to glorify their monarchs, the experts present convoluted economic theories that support the state’s monetary policy, using as much math and arcane language as possible.

As long as money is “created” by politicians, bureaucrats, and experts, society and individuals will never control their own wealth—at least, not in a sanctioned or safe way. A heresy is growing, however. Call it private money or cryptocurrency, nothing is more heretical than free-market money that the individual decides is of value to him.

Free Market Money vs Inflationary Paper

The state calls private money “the enemy.” Crypto is new, and it moves like the wind. The state cannot compete with it; the state does not even understand how to reproduce or to regulate it. Nor is this likely to happen in the future because blockchain-crypto is antagonistic to the mindset and mode of statists. Blockchain-crypto is the individual’s control of his own assets according to his own judgment. It is the secularization of wealth.

The fastest way to speed along the secularization of assets is to delegitimize fiat by exposing the intentional damage it does to society and individuals. In 1963, the Austrian School Economist Murray Rothbard wrote an influential book entitled What Has Government Done to Our Money? (An advocate of private money, Rothbard’s use of the word “Our” is notable.) The short book springboards off the insights of other Austrian School thinkers, such as Ludwig von Mises, who argued that money originated spontaneously due to the need of individuals to exchange on a more complicated level than barter. Money is a free-market phenomenon that the state appropriates through force. Fiat and the free market are antithetical.

Rothbard’s book explains one way in which free-market money and fiat cannot coexist: inflation, by which the first recipients of an increase in fiat money are enriched at the expense of the end recipients for whom the money has been debased. In short, the end recipient is robbed. Rothbard refers to inflation as “counterfeiting” because it is a creation of new money that is backed only by the false sanctity of the state, and its guns. But even the state cannot prevent its paper money from decreasing in value. Rothbard writes:

“Suppose the economy has a supply of 10,000 gold ounces, and counterfeiters [the state]…pump in 2000 ‘ounces’ more. What will be the consequences? First, there will be a clear gain to the counterfeiters [the state]. They take the newly-created money and use it to buy goods and services. In the words of the famous New Yorker cartoon, showing a group of counterfeiters in sober contemplation of their handiwork: ‘Retail spending is about to get a needed shot in the arm.’ Precisely. Local spending, indeed, does get a shot in the arm…As the new money spreads, it bids prices up—as we have seen, new money can only dilute the effectiveness of each dollar. But this dilution takes time and is therefore uneven; in the meantime, some people gain and other people lose…The first receivers of the new money gain most, and at the expense of the last receivers. Inflation, then, confers no general social benefit; instead, it redistributes the wealth in favor of the first-comers and at the expense of the laggards in the race.”

Describing inflation as “counterfeiting” is a charming departure from the usual legitimacy granted to fiat; it nicely captures the idea of inflation as theft and the state as illegitimate.

Most people have some understanding of the effect of direct inflation on prices because they see their own cost of living rise. But other, more subtle effects are as disastrous. One is a market distortion that Rothbard calls a “keystone of our economy: business calculation.” This calculation occurs when a business compares the cost of operation to the expected demand by customers. The calculation is one of the main cost-benefit analyses without which the free market cannot function well. The impact of crippling business calculation is rarely noted, however.

Inflation Distorts Critical Economic Calculations

Since prices do not all change uniformly and at the same speed, it becomes very difficult for business to separate the lasting from the transitional, and gauge truly the demands of consumers or the cost of their operations. For example, accounting practice enters the “cost” of an asset at the amount the business has paid for it. But if inflation intervenes, the cost of replacing the asset will be far greater than that recorded on the books. As a result, business accounting will seriously overstate their profits during inflation—and may even consume capital while presumably increasing their investments. Similarly, stock holders and real estate holders will acquire capital gains during an inflation that are not really “gains” at all. But they may spend part of these gains without realizing that they are thereby consuming their original capital.

The illusory profits also “suspend the free market’s penalizing of inefficient, and rewarding of efficient, firms.” Equally, inflation distorts people’s personal lives by punishing economic virtues like thrift. If $100 borrowed today can be repaid tomorrow with money that has a lower purchasing value, then at least three consequences are likely to follow. People will embrace borrowing rather than saving. They will spend the money they borrow or earn; “people will say: ‘I will buy now, though prices are high, because if I wait, prices will go up still further’. As a result, the demand for money now falls and prices go up more, proportionately, than the increase in the money supply.” Lenders become tight fisted.

The state typically addresses this “money shortage” by cranking up the printing press again, and the cycle of inflation continues. At some point, the entire system of fiat begins to break down, and individuals—even those inclined to obey—seek out alternative currencies or stores of value. At this point, the state’s veneer of sanctity also starts to crack. To maintain its monetary hold, it must either ban the alternatives or control them. Either tactic carries danger, however. Just as legitimization of the state makes individuals obey, the blatant misuse of power makes them resist.

Leaving the Church of Force-Based Money

The best time to resist and demand financial freedom is right here and now before the system goes any farther off the rails. The rebellion comes when a nexus of at least three factors occurs.

The first is when people fully grasp the monetary scam being committed by the state. In this endeavor, What Has Government Done to Our Money? is invaluable.

The second factor is when they realize the state and society cannot peacefully coexist. The state destroys all of value in society such as voluntary exchange, respect for rights, and a reputation built on honesty. The battle against monetary statism is not against any particular politician or public policy like inflation. The issue is deeper. The battle is against an entrenched tolerance of the state’s aggression. The 18th-century anarchist William Godwin expressed the human importance of rejecting aggression. “Force is an expedient, the use of which must be deplored. It is contrary to the intellect, which cannot be improved but by conviction and persuasion. Violence corrupts the man who employs it and the man upon whom it is employed.” If Godwin is correct, as I believe he is, then sanctifying the state is an act of inhumanity.

The third factor in the nexus is the existence of practical alternatives to fiat. Without alternative forms of free-market currency and wealth, those who stand up for financial freedom can all too easily become martyrs crushed by the state. And religions have already produced enough of those.

Finland’s crypto regulation is now in full effect. The first five crypto service providers have been approved to legally operate in the country, the Finnish financial regulator confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com. The grace period for operating without registration has expired.

Only Five Registrants

Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) announced on Nov. 1 that it has granted registration to five crypto service providers. The registrants are Localbitcoins, Northcrypto, Prasos, Prasos Cash Management, and Tesseract Group. A spokesperson for the FIN-FSA confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com Monday:

Starting from 1st of November these five virtual currency providers are the only ones allowed to operate in Finland.

Localbitcoins operates a global peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace. Northcrypto provides an exchange service for BTC and LTC for EUR. Tesseract Group, formerly Whalelend, provides asset management, OTC trading, and lending services.

Prasos offers crypto exchange and asset management services under four different brands. Coinmotion is an investment platform for BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP, and XLM, which also offers private crypto banking, white label solutions, and merchant services. The others are Bittiraha, a Bitcoin community and broker; Denarium, a physical bitcoin manufacturer; and Bittimaatti, a bitcoin ATM network.

“The registration process requires significant effort from the applicants, for example concerning customer due diligence and written documentation of activities,” the FIN-FSA explained.

During the registration process, the regulator assessed whether the applicants have adequate measures in areas such as preventing money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CFT), holding and safeguarding client assets, as well as having adequate management structure. The registrants have submitted written statements to the FIN-FSA describing how they are complying with the requirements. Going forward, the regulator will monitor them for compliance such as by requesting clarifications and performing inspections.

The FIN-FSA emphasized:

From 1 November 2019, only virtual currency providers who fulfill the requirements provided by legislation may practice activities in Finland.

Finland’s Crypto Regulation

The Act on virtual currency providers (572/2019) entered into force in Finland on May 1, installing the FIN-FSA as “the registration authority and supervisory authority for virtual currency providers,” the regulator’s website details. The law is based on the EU’s anti-money laundering legislation.

Crypto issuers, exchanges, marketplace operators, and wallet providers are required to register. The FIN-FSA defines a “wallet provider” as “a natural or legal person who holds virtual currency for the account of some other party or provides for the transfer or storage of virtual currency.” Traders who provides crypto services within a limited network or occasionally are exempt from registration, as are professional activities that require some other authorization by other authorities.

The regulator reiterated that “New providers of virtual currencies may not start the provision of services in Finland before their registration application has been approved,” adding:

If the virtual currency provider does not comply with the requirements, its activities will be prohibited and the FIN-FSA will impose a fine on the provider.

According to a Reuters report on Nov. 5, the licenses introduced by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in October 2018 have apparently led to few approvals, with reporters succeeding to independently identify just one licensee.

Crypto funds said to lack experience and support

While confirming the numbers remains difficult in light of the SFC’s policy of discretion — it declined Reuters’ request for comment and does not publicly announce license approvals — industry experts have indicated that the barriers for market participants remain high.

Hong Kong-based Diginex, operator of a cryptocurrency “fund of funds” is reported to have won approval for a license back in June, with CEO Richard Byworth stating the firm believes it “vital to be regulated to build trust with our clients but also in the industry.”

Gaven Cheong — a partner law firm Simmons & Simmons, which advised Diginex on its SFC application, told Reuters:

“Last year there was a lot of excitement but since then we haven’t seen much activity. Not many new managers in this area have the background, experience or support to mount such an undertaking, and this has meant that many applications never even get started.”

Unnamed sources told Reuters the stringent nature of the licensing and broader regulatory framework had pushed some Hong Kong crypto funds offshore.

Regulator not obstructive, industry sources consider

Yet others have a different perspective, believing it is not the regulation per se but rather the time needed for funds to develop the required systems for custody, audit and cybersecurity. Rocky Mui, a partner at Hong Kong law firm Clifford Chance, stated:

“My take is it is more an operational and infrastructure issue, than the regulator being obstructive.”

As usual, high volatility and particularly last year’s “crypto winter” are cited as factors that spook applicants, with blockchain investment firm Kinetic Capital partner Jehan Chu arguing that:

“Poor returns in 2018 scared large institutions away from allocating to crypto funds, causing those who survived to shelve their licensing plans. As institutional investors step into the market, crypto funds will dust off their licensing applications and take a fully regulated approach.”

As reported, the SFC launched its fund licensing scheme together with guidance on regulatory standards back in October 2018, yet did not formalize a statutory framework at the time.

Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission has established a new regulatory framework that allows crypto exchanges to opt-in to be licensed and regulated. Starting Wednesday, centralized trading platforms can apply for a license, providing they meet certain requirements including adequate measures for the safe custody of assets, insurance, hot and cold wallets, and private key management.

An Opt-In System

The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published a new regulatory framework for crypto exchanges on Wednesday. CEO Ashley Alder explained that the commission met with a number of crypto exchange operators after unveiling a conceptual framework that could be used to regulate crypto exchanges last year. “After an in-depth examination of the unique technical and operational features of these platforms, we finally concluded that some could be regulated by us,” he remarked.

The commission has been focusing on whether to regulate crypto exchanges. Alder elaborated, “We saw this as a priority because this type of platform has proliferated in Hong Kong and up to now has largely escaped any form of regulation,” adding that it is largely because crypto assets fall outside the legal definition of securities and futures contracts. Since bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not securities and “nothing in our new framework alters this position,” he admitted that the SFC can only regulate those platforms that choose to include at least one security crypto asset or token for trading. “But once this happens our new rules will apply to all platform operations, even if the vast majority of other virtual assets traded on the platform are not securities.” The CEO clarified:

So this, essentially, is a framework allowing a platform operator to opt-in to regulation … Once licenses are granted to those platforms which choose to opt-in, investors will then be able to distinguish easily between properly regulated platforms, and all the rest.

What the Regulation Entails

The SFC detailed in its “Position Paper” published on Wednesday the rules and requirements for crypto trading platforms to be regulated. The commission also emphasized that only centralized platforms in Hong Kong that provide crypto trading, clearing, and settlement services will be considered for licensing. Applications from peer-to-peer marketplaces will not be accepted at this time. The SFC confirmed:

As from 6 November 2019, a firm which operates a centralized virtual asset trading platform in Hong Kong and intends to offer trading of at least one security token on this platform may apply for a license from the SFC for Types 1 and 7 regulated activities.

The Type 1 license is for dealing in securities and the Type 7 is for automated trading services (ATS) activities. The commission also requires all trading activities of its licensees, including those conducted by their group companies, to be carried out under a single, SFC-licensed legal entity. The regulator explained that not only will it allow for comprehensive oversight, but it also “minimizes any uncertainty about which parts of the business are licensed and supervised by the SFC.”

Further, licensees are required to obtain prior written approval from the SFC for any plan or proposal such as for introducing or offering a new or incidental product or service, or to make a material change to an existing service or activity. Licensees must also provide monthly reports to the commission and engage an independent professional firm to review their activities and operations annually.

The Position Paper also outlines licensing conditions, the first of which details who can trade on licensed platforms. The SFC noted:

The licensee must only provide services to professional investors.

The definition of a professional investor is extensive; it includes an individual, a partnership or a corporation with a portfolio of at least 8 million HKD (~$1 million) or equivalent, or a trust corporation with total assets of at least 40 million HKD or equivalent.

For the safe custody of assets, the SFC requires licensees “to ensure that an insurance policy covering the risks associated with the custody of virtual assets held in both hot storage (full coverage) and cold storage (a substantial coverage, eg, 95%) is in effect at all times.” Licensed platform operators and their associated entities must also store 98% of client crypto assets in cold wallets and limit the amount stored in hot wallets to 2%. The commission also expects them “to set up and implement strong internal controls and governance procedures for private key management to ensure all cryptographic seeds and keys are securely generated, stored and backed up.” Moreover, the SFC added:

A virtual asset trading platform operator, upon becoming licensed, will be placed in the SFC Regulatory Sandbox. This would typically mean more frequent reporting, monitoring and reviews.

There are many more conditions that must be met, including complying with the SFC code of conduct and having adequate measures for know-your-client (KYC), anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), preventing market manipulation and abusive activities, accounting and auditing, and risk management.

As noted by Blockstream CSO Samson Mow and others on Nov. 6, mining no longer features on a list of industries Beijing considers undesirable.

“Bullish for Bitcoin”

The change came via a new edition of China’s Industrial Structure Adjustment Guidance Catalog, which will take effect from the start of 2020.

“China’s National Development and Reform Commission has removed #cryptocurrency mining from the list of industries they want to eliminate. Bullish for #Bitcoin,” Mow commented.

A previous incarnation of the document earlier this year had conversely included Bitcoin mining as one of the government’s targets.

The news marks a rare boon for Bitcoin-related activities in China, a country where cryptocurrency outside the control of the central bank remains all but banned.

BTC markets calm

The recent endorsement of blockchain technology from president Xi Jinping coincided with a dramatic rise in BTC/USD, after which local media cautioned on misinterpreting the remarks as supportive of crypto.

Following the most recent announcement, however, little appeared to change on Bitcoin markets.

Mining has long formed a profitable industry in China, with cheap electricity meaning major participants still reside there. Canaan Creative, one of the biggest Bitcoin mining rig manufacturers, will reportedly undergo a $400 million initial public offering, or IPO, later this month.",,https://www.wired.com/story/coinbase-bitcoin-staking/,"This June, as the news bristled with headlines about Facebook’s cryptocurrency-to-be and the price of bitcoin once again soared, the mood in the San Francisco offices of Coinbase was subdued. In 2017, the cryptocurrency exchange was close to the frenetic epicenter of the bitcoin boom. Millions of people used its app to dip their toes into cryptocurrency speculation. Then came the crash. By now, according to Coinbase COO Emilie Choi, the company has weathered a few similar cycles and drawn an important lesson from the highs and lows: Booms don’t last. “It’s a roller-coaster ride here,” she says. “There’s no two ways about it.”

Sure enough, bitcoin plummeted that same afternoon, as cryptocurrency prices are wont to do.

Coinbase has remained one of the biggest exchanges for buying and selling crypto—making it an $8 billion business, at last valuation. Despite increased wariness of overvalued unicorns after recent high-profile flameouts, CEO Brian Armstrong said last month that Coinbase has actually turned a profit three years running. But Coinbase’s fortunes, built around the fees users pay for trading, remain closely tied to rollicking price of bitcoin, and to a lesser extent the nearly two dozen other tokens it supports. Profitable, yes, but precarious.

So today Coinbase will begin offering a service, known as ""staking,"" that it hopes will convince users to stick around even when prices aren’t spiking. Under the new system, if you hold particular cryptocurrencies in your Coinbase account, you’ll receive set returns independent of market fluctuations. Coinbase is starting with a coin called Tezos. The returns—roughly 5 percent to start—come in the form of tokens that Coinbase receives for participating in the network that keeps the Tezos blockchain secure. Similar to how new bitcoin are distributed based on how much computing power is contributed to network, Tezos doles out new coins based on how many coins each participant has “staked.”

Basically, it’s interest. Just don’t call it that. Coinbase prefers the ersatz term “staking rewards.” That distinction is rooted in regulatory questions.

While staking has become a common choice for newer coins, it’s unclear where the process falls under investing rules. Because of those concerns, staking was made available to wealthy investors in March, but held back from ordinary Coinbase users until now. The company says it now feels confident that it has worked out an arrangement that falls within the SEC’s good graces. Coinbase is the first major exchange to open up staking to all US customers.

Rhetorical contortions aside, Coinbase bills staking as a step in the direction of looking more like a bank, with the diverse revenue sources they enjoy. That includes generating fees from serving as a custodian of assets and facilitating lending and consumer payments. “We’re just doing it in our own crypto way,” Choi says.

Beyond the risks of depending on bitcoin prices for revenue, Coinbase faces growing competition.

Beyond the risks of depending on bitcoin prices for revenue, the company faces growing competition. “They’re fighting a two-front battle,” says John Sedunov, a professor of finance at Villanova University. Coinbase has been seen as uniquely approachable in an industry known for shady actors. But others now compete for that mantle. Rival exchanges like Binance have grown in the US, and there are now a raft of startups that specialize in safe offline storage for your crypto coins. New offerings from the legacy world of finance, like Bakkt, which shares a common owner with the New York Stock Exchange, and Fidelity Digital Assets, are also entering the fray with existing financial relationships and trusted brands. “If I’m thinking about who I trust, do I trust JP Morgan to be the custodian of my cryptocurrency or a website that’s been operating for a few years?” Sedunov asks.

It’s no surprise, he says, to see big exchanges getting into edgier aspects of crypto that legacy businesses won’t yet touch. It’s a familiar playbook. During the so-called “crypto winter,” the long period of low prices after the 2017 bitcoin boom, a common way for exchanges to bolster bottom lines was to add more esoteric coins for trading. Tezos, listed on the exchange this August, is one of Coinbase’s newest additions.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-communist-party-reportedly-filling-roles-at-top-exchange-huobi/,"Chinese Communist Party Reportedly Filling Roles at Top Exchange Huobi

A source has reported to news.Bitcoin.com that the Chinese government is attempting to directly manage the crypto exchange industry in the country. According to the source, this could lead to frozen assets for U.S. account holders and others. Notably, Huobi Global’s website has announced that U.S. accounts “have been gradually disabled” due to compliance issues, and that they “will freeze all US user accounts from 13 November 2019 (GMT+8) onwards.” The anonymous source maintains the motivations for the move go deeper than mere compliance with U.S. standards.

Huobi Global Freezes Accounts

As Huobi Global and Chinese crypto investment community Bishijie.com recently reported, U.S. accounts on the exchange will soon be frozen. The company had already begun disabling user capabilities prior to the notice. Traders have until November 13 to move their assets from the exchange, and the Huobi blog post details the protocol as well as how to sign up for the U.S.-compliant version, Huobi US.

While the creation of and migration to U.S.-specific exchanges for compliance purposes is not unusual, a Hong Kong-based source and OTC trader informs news.Bitcoin.com that there is more to the story, and it is not only U.S.-based traders who should be concerned.

Government Management of the Crypto Industry

The source most notably told news.Bitcoin.com that according to an insider, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is stepping into managerial positions at popular crypto exchange Huobi:

It’s the fact. Already have CCP members take role as huobi management.

A Volatile Backdrop

As previously reported, the Chinese government also appears to now be censoring criticism of ”blockchain”. President Xi Jinping’s recent public promotion of the technology, coupled with a focus on development of the nation’s own central bank digital currency — known as the digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system — adds further context to the Hong Kong trader’s reports. “Also president Xi announced China will put more resources into crypto space,” he noted.

With the situation in Hong Kong volatile, fear among crypto traders is pronounced and some worry markets will be overtaken. According to the anonymous source, the CCP is moving to:

Take every leading company in the [financial] industry. Alibaba. Tencent.

The statement hearkens to events in early October, when Alipay tweeted: “There’re several reports about @Alipay being used for bitcoin transactions. To reiterate, Alipay closely monitors over-the-counter transactions to identify irregular behavior and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.”

""I don't think of Bitcoin as a currency. It's actually not a great medium of exchange because of it's volatility,"" Marcus said speaking at the New York Times DealBook Conference in New York. ""I see it as digital gold.""

Marcus said Bitcoin is like gold because you can hold on to it as an investment just as people do with actual gold, but the drastic upswings and dips that Bitcoin goes through makes it a bad option for people who need a system to send remittances across borders.

That is a key market that Facebook is targeting with its Libra cryptocurrency and Calibra digital wallet. Unlike Bitcoin, libra's value will be tied to currencies like the U.S. dollar and the Euro, which will help it remain stable.

Marcus said a key reason that Bitcoin has not been regulated out of existence is because it is not perceived to be a medium of exchange.

Marcus has been the face of Facebook's libra cryptocurrency and Calibra digital wallet since the company announced the two projects in June.

Just over a year ago, the idea of centralized financial behemoths trialing blockchain or crypto solutions would have been unthinkable.

Currently, cryptocurrency is traded like never before. In just the last few weeks, major players have launched both Bitcoin options and futures platforms, making cryptocurrency accessible to a whole new range of investors.

For crypto enthusiasts, each instance of wider integration with mainstream finance is a cause for celebration. For cryptocurrency’s many detractors, these new ways of trading are simply opening the door to a rogue sector whose instability could have serious ramifications.

But with the growing proliferation of binary cryptocurrency options, regulatory bodies in the United States such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission are being kept busy by a new generation of scammers seeking to relieve investors of their funds. In the last two months alone, the CFTC has clamped down on fraudulent binary options schemes operating in the U.S. worth over $15 million.

Already a high-risk investment strategy, binary options platforms are often based online and are hard to regulate. Unfortunately, navigating binary cryptocurrency options has proven easier said than done for many inexperienced investors.

What are binary options?

Binary by name, binary by nature. This method of options trading earns its name due to there being only two opposing outcomes for investors: a fixed sum or nothing. The notion of binary options is easy to understand.

Investors bet on the value of an underlying asset at a certain period of time in the future. The outcome of the binary option is a simple yes/no proposition. If they’re correct, they can cash out on their previously agreed-upon winnings. If not, investors usually leave empty-handed.

There are a number of binary options contracts in which the customer may be eligible for a small refund, but these are few and far between. For this reason, binary options are also known as “all-or nothing options.”

While binary options are an inherently risky trading method, some are listed on registered exchanges that are policed by U.S. regulators, namely the CFTC or SEC. According to the FBI, most binary options are available via a plethora of online platforms, many of which are not compliant with stringent U.S. regulatory requirements.

An unfortunate truth of all methods of cryptocurrency trading is that there is always a high risk of falling foul of a scam. The same is true for binary options trading. By virtue of both operating online and the sheer volume of these platforms, it is hard for law enforcement and regulators to crack down on cowboy outfits.

Braden Perry, a former attorney at the CFTC and partner at the Kennyhertz Perry law firm, told Cointelegraph, “On their face, binary options are not fraudulent,” but the proliferation of internet-based platforms has proved a useful environment for scammers:

“Many binary options products are listed on exchanges and have regulatory oversight. But like Forex and Cryptocurrency trading, many internet-based platforms have surged into the market, and with that surge, the opportunity for fraudulent promotional schemes, overstatement of returns, and the failure to pay out for the wins have increased.”

How can investors be swindled?

The prospect of being wrong on the value of an underlying asset alone is not the only way for investors to lose their money with binary options. Not all platforms are created equal. Perry explained to Cointelegraph that binary options trading can be manipulated, leading investors to lose their money even after placing a successful bid:

“Some actors are using manipulative software to rig the system, so ‘winning’ bids end up losing. This is new territory where some investors have made significant money. And where there are legitimate products, non-legitimate products follow. The main reason is the lack of clarity on the regulatory structure and the ability to make markets without oversight.”

A classic tactic to part investors from their funds is to refuse to credit accounts or reimburse customers. The ways in which this can be done vary from repeatedly cancelling withdrawal requests to accusing the customer themself of fraudulent behavior on its platform.

Much like with many other fraudulent vehicles, identity theft is also rife. Investors should always be wary of handing over any copies of credit cards, passports, bills or any other personal data. Giving any or all of these to fraudulent binary options platforms can allow malicious actors to steal your identity.

Fraudulent platforms can be hard to spot. One of the most universal signs of a scam, regardless of the manner of investment it requires, is the promise of huge, low-risk returns. As per the FBI’s warning, fraudulent binary options websites advertise undeliverable promises on social media, trading websites and message boards to lure in unsuspecting customers.

They have also been known to harangue investors with cold-calls from boiler room operations, in which pushy salespeople try to trick naive customers into “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunities. Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, told Cointelegraph that the brief maturity of binary options means that they are at a higher risk of being manipulated. Balani also explained to Cointelegraph that investors should be aware of hastily constructed scam platforms online:

“Many binary options platforms have popped up recently. Just a quick glance at some of these can tell you that they have been put together in a hurry. Most of such platforms don’t specify their price sources. Trading on such venues is risky as their product can be manipulated easily.”

CFTC dishes out multimillion dollar ban for ATM Coin

Although binary options trading is relatively new to the crypto sector, scammers are quickly finding themselves in the dock, facing heavy fines. On Nov. 1, the CFTC announced that a New York court had ordered defendants to pay $4.25 million in penalties for an investment fraud scam involving the cryptocurrency ATM coin. The Eastern District Court of New York entered an order against multiple entities for committing fraud and misappropriating client funds.

The defendants comprise a mix of both individuals and corporate entities spread across the globe, including Blake Harrison Kantor and Nathan Mullins, along with four corporate entities: Turks and Caicos-located Blue Bit Analytics, United Kingdom-based Blue Bit Banc and two New York-based firms, Mercury Cove and G. Thomas Client Services.

Although the penalty was served only recently, the CFTC’s Virtual Currency Task Force first filed the case on April 16, 2018, charging defendants with fraud. According to the CFTC, defendants misappropriated customer funds obtained through binary options by converting Blue Bit Banc investments into ATM coin, telling investors they were worth a substantial amount of money.

Balani told Cointelegraph that, while options trading in the cryptocurrency sector is a positive development that could lead to wider adoption, he maintains that binary options are a step back for investors and the industry alike:

“Growth in crypto vanilla options is a good sign and it will help is increasing institutional participation and reducing long term volatility of crypto markets. Binary options is an exception here, a lot of binary options platforms attract customers by selling them a dream of making astronomical returns in short duration. Binary options are high risk products and One should understand the mechanics of binary options completely before trading these products.”

$11 million Ponzi binary options scheme

The $4.25 million penalty against binary options scammers in November was the CFTC’s second successful strike in the past two months. On Oct. 16, the regulator issued a civil enforcement action against Circle Society.

In a press release, the CFTC announced that it would be charging the Nevada-based company and its owner, David Gilbert Saffron, with fraudulent solicitation, misappropriation and registration violations in relation to an $11 million binary options scheme.

Tracing it back to December 2017, the CFTC claims that Saffron and Circle Society fraudulently solicited at least $11 million worth of Bitcoin and fiat currency to trade off-exchange binary options on foreign currencies and cryptocurrency pairs.

Saffron allegedly lured in unsuspecting investors by promising astronomic returns of up to 300%. Instead of using investor funds to trade in binary options as agreed, Saffron transferred the funds to his own wallet to pay out previous participants, a textbook example of a Ponzi scheme. Echoing the thoughts of many, CFTC Chairman Heath P. Tarbert said at the time:",,https://www.coindesk.com/north-korea-set-up-a-blockchain-firm-to-launder-cash-un,"North Korea has been using a Hong Kong-based blockchain company to launder money, according to a quarterly report from the UN Security Council’s Sanctions Committee on North Korea.

As reported by South Korean newspaper Chosun, North Korea employed a shipping and logistics firm called Marine China, which runs on a blockchain platform, to avoid international sanctions by laundering stolen cryptocurrency.

The report claims a man named Julian Kim, under the alias Tony Walker, was the sole owner and investor in the firm, and had attempted to withdraw money from banks in Singapore on several occasions. As per Chosun, the UN claims the laundering scheme, which also involved another undisclosed individual linked to the firm, circulated the stolen crypto through upwards of 5,000 transactions in multiple countries to obfuscate its source.

The report further states that North Korea has developed precision “spear-phishing” attacks. Over the past three years, a previous UN report said, 17 countries have been targeted by its hacking experts resulting in over $2 billion in losses – a figure that regime has denied.

Chosun adds that the report also notes the development of malicious code used to move stolen bitcoin to a server located at Pyongyang’s Kim Il-sung University.

Severe sanctions against North Korea from the UN and other international bodies have pushed the country’s regime towards cryptocurrencies over time. This September, Vice reported the country is developing its own cryptocurrency with properties similar to bitcoin to sidestep international sanctions.

Bitcoin’s repeated failure to produce a strong bounce from key support indicates the bullish sentiment has fizzled somewhat.

Failure to hold above a bearish MA on the longer-term chart indicates scope for a deeper drop.

BTC risks falling to $8,800 in the short-term and may extend the decline to $8,500.

A high-volume triangle breakout on a 4-hour chart would be bullish, although that looks unlikely at press time.

Bitcoin is struggling to revive its stalled rally and could soon roll over to deeper support levels below $9,000.

The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $7,500 on Oct. 25 and jumped to $10,350 on the following day, according to Bitstamp data. The breakout into five figures, however, was short-lived, as prices quickly fell back below $10,000 on Oct. 28 and have remained largely trapped in a narrow range of $9,600–$9,000 since.

Downside has been restricted so far by the 200-day average – a barometer of long-term market trends. A pullback typically reverses from key support levels like the 200-day MA, especially if volumes are low, as has been the case recently.

So far, however, the cryptocurrency has failed to produce a strong bounce from the support, despite positive seasonality.

Prices jumped more than $400 to $9,586 from the MA on Nov. 4 only to surrender gains on the following day. A similar weak bounce has been observed in the last 24 hours or so with prices rising to $9,450 only to dive back to lows near $9,200.

These shallow bounces indicate bullish sentiment generated by the sharp rise to $10,350 has weakened and the market may test dip demand by revisiting levels below $9,000.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,170 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.50 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

Daily chart

BTC’s upside has been capped by the trendline connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 lows multiple times in the last few days. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency has tested the 200-day MA support five times in eight days.

Trading volumes have fallen sharply since the recent drop-off from $10,350. Low-volume pullbacks are often reversed, but a decent bounce continues to remain elusive.

All-in-all, the cryptocurrency looks set for a drop to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,800.

Monthly chart

The upper shadow of the monthly candle represents rejection above the 5-month MA at $9,265. A failure to hold above descending averages usually translates into a notable price drop. Major support is seen at the ascending 10-month MA near $8,000.

4-hour chart

The contracting triangle seen above looks likely to be breached to the lower side, as suggested by the daily and monthly indicators.

The ascending 100- and 200-candle MAs, currently at $8,928 and $8,558, respectively, could offer support if a drop out of the zone is confirmed.

The bearish view would be invalidated if the triangle ends with a high-volume bullish breakout. In that case, a retest of $10,000 could be seen.

During our last market outlook, cryptocurrency prices had found new foundations after the massive rally on Friday, October 25. Since then digital currency prices have been meandering roughly in the same positions after coins like BTC failed to break upper resistance on various occasions.

Crypto Prices Hold Foundational Support But Fail to Break Upper Resistance

At the time of publication, the market capitalization of all 3,000+ digital assets is hovering around $260 billion on Thursday, November 7. Currently, the top 15 coins with the largest market caps are down a few percentages between 1-5%. BTC is currently trading for $9,240 per coin and the market has an overall valuation of $166 billion today. The digital asset is down 1.44% in the last 24 hours but it’s up +0.16% for the week.

There’s around $22.7 billion in global trades today with BTC and 76% of those trades are paired against tether (USDT). ETH is swapping for $187 per coin and is down 1.74% today but ETH is up 2.3% over the last seven days. ETH has a market valuation of around $20.3 billion and roughly $9.1 billion in trade volume worldwide. XRP has lost more than 3% on Thursday and 1.11% for the week as each coin is trading for $0.29. Lastly, the stablecoin tether (USDT) is holding the fifth-largest market cap today and is capturing roughly two-thirds of all trades within the cryptoconomy.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

The fourth-largest market valuation is held by bitcoin cash (BCH) on November 7 and each BCH is swapping for $291 per coin. BCH is down 3.3% today but is up around 2.7% over the course of the last seven days. There’s about $2.28 billion in global BCH swaps and the cryptocurrency has a market cap of around $5.28 billion. Yesterday digital currency analyst John Isige noted that BCH prices re-entered the $300 range and after conquering that price point “bitcoin cash has changed focus to $400.”

“In the meantime, [BCH] is trading at $304 after a 4% gain on the day. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) breaching 70 to show that the bullish action’s momentum is at its peak,” Isige wrote on November 6. “The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also puts emphasis on the bullish action.” The following day on November 7 shows 62% of the BCH trades are being swapped with tether (USDT). This is followed by BTC (16.8%), USD (13.8%), ETH (3%), and KRW (2.6%).

Whale Watch

Over the last two weeks, there’s been a lot of fear uncertainty and doubt (FUD) surrounding the topic of whales. First, there was a research study that was widely debunked concerning one single BTC whale allegedly manipulating the market in 2017. Then many others have been watching giant whale wallets and onchain movements that showcase massive BTC transactions. The latest bitcoin whale discussion is centered around the Twitter account @whale_alert which has noticed a dormant BTC address housing 80,000 BTC.

“That address alone — if that is actually a whale who’s been holding their coins for so long without doing anything with them — if they decide, ‘Okay, let’s go sell them,’ it would crush the market completely,” Whale Alert explained in a recent interview. “But it’s really hard to say anything about the status of that address: Are those keys lost? Is that person even still alive? … It’s just waiting to see if anything happens with those addresses,” the Twitter account added. Meanwhile according to data stemming from the crypto analysis site Coin Metrics, the Bitcoin Rich List (BTC holders with 1,000 or more) has grown by 30% in the last year.

China Embracing Blockchain Could Be Bearish or Bullish

As news.Bitcoin.com’s Lubomir Tassev reported on November 6, the new edition of China’s Industrial Structure Adjustment Guidance Catalog has removed bitcoin mining from the unwanted industries list. Since the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping, lauded blockchain in a recent speech, digital currency markets have seen a massive boom and many people believe the new outlook from China is optimistic. There has been a huge shift from Chinese residents transitioning from the over-the-counter marketplace Localbitcoins to Paxful after localbitcoins.com published strict KYC/AML policies.

Moreover, Chinese traders are using other avenues like Localethereum and local.Bitcoin.com as well. However, various pundits believe that China will build a digital currency that will hurt public cryptos like bitcoin in the future. Gold bug and economist Peter Schiff believes a gold-backed digital currency stemming from China will be “bearish for bitcoin.” Schiff tweeted his opinion on November 1 saying:

According to Max Keiser, I’m an idiot because I think gold is better money than bitcoin. He also claims China is about to launch a cryptocurrency backed by gold. This is bullish for gold and bearish for bitcoin. A crypto backed by gold is much better than one backed by nothing.

‘BTC Is Not a Great Medium of Exchange’ Says Facebook’s Crypto Boss

On November 6, the head of Facebook’s cryptocurrency subsidiary Calibra, David Marcus, told participants at the New York Times Dealbook Conference that BTC is an investment and not a currency.

“I don’t think of bitcoin as a currency — It’s actually not a great medium of exchange because of its volatility — I see it as digital gold.” Moreover, Marcus highlighted that BTC basically conformed to the traditional status quo investment environment because it’s not considered a medium of exchange. Marcus said a key reason that Bitcoin has not been regulated out of existence is because it is not perceived to be a medium of exchange. “It’s an investment class that’s decorrelated from the rest of the market — Why feel threatened by that?”

Will Bullish Markets Continue or Are We Seeing a Fake-Out?

Overall cryptocurrency fans and observers are watching market movements, but things have been quiet lately as far as big price movements are concerned. Some people believe crypto markets will break through the upper resistance and continue the bullish trend that started on October 25.

I am being asked about a Head Fake on the six hour $btcusd chart. The setup up is near perfect all that is needed is completion, a hard down bar. https://t.co/6GmgDiy3yz I'll be talking about these in Milan for Swissquote this Friday. @Swissquote_it — John Bollinger (@bbands) November 5, 2019

Others believe the current jump could be a fake-out, and after a few attempts, BTC’s market value could see the $7-8K price ranges again. Digital currency markets are seemingly at a pivotal position once again as traders hope and pray they played their positions correctly.

As local financial news outlet RBC reported on Nov. 7 citing sources familiar with the matter, Russia’s interior ministry will work with various state organs to draw up the plans, which could enter into law in 2021.

Confiscating the non-confiscatable

The push does not single out Bitcoin, but instead refers to “digital assets” as a general phenomenon, chief among which are cryptocurrencies, says RBC.

The publication quoted Nikita Kulikov, head of a dedicated committee at the Russian parliament, as explaining:

“The constant growth trend in crimes using virtual assets, and the lack of consumer protection in the face of this kind of criminal onslaught, naturally dictate the need to develop mechanisms for legal regulation and control of virtual asset exchange.”

Among the options under consideration is the creation of a government cryptocurrency wallet for transferring funds.

Not your keys…

Russia has yet to implement its long-awaited package of laws regarding cryptocurrency, which has seen multiple delays.

According to various parties speaking to RBC, crypto would need legal recognition before the government could justify legal grounds to confiscate it as part of judicial proceedings.

As with other countries’ attempts, however, the way authorities would take control of investors’ holdings remains unclear.

In theory, RBC notes, crypto held on exchanges could be accessed if the exchange in question complies. For coins held in wallets to which the investor holds the private keys, the method of acquisition is a mystery.

The plans thus speak to a potential lack of understanding of how decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin operate. As Cointelegraph reported, India’s recent recommendation to ban them faces similar difficulties: effectively attempting to control the uncontrollable.

At the same time, Russia appears permissive to other facets of cryptocurrency. One of president Vladimir Putin’s own aides has revealed he wants to control 20% of Bitcoin mining production from a new farm located in the country’s northwest.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN1XH1HY,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China, which is among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, has decided against eliminating the mining of the cryptocurrency, the state planner has indicated.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in April sought public opinion on a revised list of industries it wanted to encourage, restrict or eliminate. Bitcoin mining was among the activities on the list at the time.

However, the final list published by the state planner on Wednesday did not mention bitcoin mining. Its exclusion was reported by industry website CoinDesk.

It was not clear what the NDRC’s reasons were. The NDRC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.

China is the world’s largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but such activities have fallen in a regulatory gray area.

While China has been developing its own digital currency, it has in recent years moved to tightly regulate the wider sector.

In 2017, it started to ban initial coin offerings and shut cryptocurrency trading exchanges and it also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world’s largest - to find bases elsewhere.

Nearly half of bitcoin mining pools – groups of miners who team up for economies of scale - are in the Asia-Pacific, a Cambridge University study said last year.

Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear.

In a company blog Wednesday, Coinbase said U.S. customers (barring residents of Hawaii and New York) can now stake the smart-contract platform’s crypto with an estimated 5 percent annual return.

Tezos uses an alternative consensus mechanism to proof-of-work mining – the system built into the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bitcoin. Called proof-of-stake, the alternative mechanism rewards network users for holding onto its coins and thereby helping protect the network.

Coinbase’s 5 percent estimate is based on Tezos’ last 90 days of staking returns. The firm also notes that there’s an initial holding period of 35–40 days, after which stakers will start to see rewards appear in their accounts every three days.

The exchange has also added Tezos to Coinbase Earn, a program aimed at educating the public about crypto, and will give out XTZ to participants completing educational videos.

Coinbase soft-launched staking for both Tezos and decentralized finance token Maker (MKR) this March on Coinbase Custody.

As Coinbase wrote at the time, Coinbase Custody primarily serves institutional clients holding large amounts of crypto. This latest initiative brings staking to even the smallest of Tezos holdings, however.

Coinbase also recently rolled out 1.25 percent interest on users’ holdings of the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC.

On Nov. 5, during the hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental Affairs, senators asked leaders from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the National Counterterrorism Center questions on topics including counterterrorism efforts, foreign influence in elections, cybersecurity measures, border security, and of course, cryptocurrencies.

FBI might find itself walled off by new technology

Former Presidential Candidate and Republican Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, asked the intelligence officers whether the U.S. should not take some kind of effort in dealing with cryptocurrencies and its challenges they present to law enforcement’s anti-terrorist activities. He said:

“I’m not in the Banking Committee. I don’t begin to understand how cryptocurrency works. I would think it is more difficult to carry out your work when we can’t follow the money because the money is hidden from us and wonder whether there should not be some kind of effort taken in our nation to deal with cryptocurrency.”

FBI Director Wray took the lead in answering the question, saying that cryptocurrencies already present a problem for the agency. He stated:

“For us, cryptocurrency is already a significant issue and we can project out pretty easily that it’s going to become a bigger and bigger one. Whether or not that is the subject of some kind of regulation as the response is harder for me to speak to.”

Wray concluded his answer by saying that the FBI is already keeping an eye on cryptocurrencies, using “tools that we have to try to follow the money.” The FBI director also said that if the U.S. doesn’t keep up with new technologies, it will soon find itself being “walled off.”

That level has been in play for the past 72 hours and has seen two tests since local highs of $9,520 on Monday.

The week’s behavior continues a broader trend which Cointelegraph reported on previously — Bitcoin remains range-bound between $9,000 and $9,500.

Now, commentators are considering the potential for a change in the pattern as volatility lessens. For Jim Wyckoff of gold outfit Kitco, that watershed could appear before the end of the week.

“Recent price action has choppy, quiet and sideways. This ‘collapse in volatility’ suggests a much bigger price move is right over the horizon—maybe yet this week,” he summarized on Wednesday.

Wyckoff added that bulls held “slight overall near-term technical advantage,” giving strength to the possibility of a break to the upside.

For regular Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe meanwhile, Bitcoin appears to be in a similar position to 2016, just before markets began a breakout to all-time highs of $20,000.

For him, Bitcoin hitting nearly $14,000 earlier this year followed by a consolidation period means that next in line is an uptick. This should happen by next May’s block reward halving and could take BTC/USD to $22,000.

“Looks similar to 2016 still,” he told Twitter followers on Wednesday.

Altcoins drip down amid lack of momentum

SFC brings security tokens and crypto futures under its remit

AAX’s launch comes just one day after Hong Kong’s securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), released new guidance for domestic cryptocurrency exchanges.

The watchdog has indicated that cryptocurrency trading related to security offering or futures contracts will henceforth come under its remit as a regulated activity — an announcement whose significance has been underscored by industry commentator Dovey Wan, a founding partner of blockchain investment firm Primitive Ventures.

In its guidance, the SFC stated that a license or authorization would be required for cryptocurrency futures products unless an exemption applies. It outlined:

“Hong Kong hosts dozens of virtual asset trading platforms which pose serious investor protection concerns. A number of these may decide not to seek an SFC license under the new regulatory framework. This is a course of action which is open to them simply by ensuring that no virtual asset traded on their platforms is a ‘security’ or ‘futures contract.’”

As SCMP notes, the SFC’s chief executive Ashley Alder has stressed this week that certain crypto futures or derivatives contracts that offer high leverage pose high risks and could potentially be deemed illegal in the region.

AAX bets on a regulated future

As covered earlier this week, a fresh report has alleged that the SFC’s licensing regime for cryptocurrency fund managers — introduced back in Oct. 2018 — has resulted in just one confirmed approval to date.

This March, the SFC released regulatory guidelines for Security Token Offerings, indicating that security tokens are likely to be classified as securities under Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Ordinance, and thus fall under existing securities laws.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/btc-miners-no-more-basement-rigs-greater-profits-to-come,"Back in the early days, when Bitcoin (BTC) was but a niche experiment for cypherpunks and basement-dwelling hobbyists, the process of its creation required little more than a budget CPU. Since that time, however, an entire industry has sprung forth and a quasi-gold rush rivaling that of the 1850s has taken the world by storm.

As a direct result of both the increasing difficulty of Bitcoin mining and the decreasing profitability of mining solo, the current mining industry has become dominated by huge conglomerates. Ostensibly known as Bitcoin’s industrial revolution, the rise of mining collaborations changed the game for everyone.

CPU mining quickly became antiquated in favor of more powerful GPU-based systems, and facing the threat of obsoletion, numerous old-school miners joined forces — forging the pioneering mining pools which have become the norm today.

Two of the biggest mining pools, Antpool and BTC.com, presently occupy a combined 29% of the entire Bitcoin mining market.

In order to at least turn a profit from Bitcoin mining, swathes of dedicated high-powered mining machines are required. They are so sophisticated that a singular unit almost prices out the average retail miners. These improved models no longer use GPUs but instead, employ application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs.

Bitmain, the owner of both Antpool and BTC.com, is, unsurprisingly, one of the largest manufacturers of cryptocurrency mining equipment. Early last month, the goliath announced two new ASIC miners, the s17+ and the T17+. Bitmain co-founder, Jihan Wu, promised the machines would bring both increased power efficiency and overall hash rate improvements. As far as Bitmain sees it, the popularity of Bitcoin mining isn’t showing any signs of slowing. Several weeks after the announcement, a mining firm based in the United Kingdom known as Argo Blockchain placed a $9.51-million order for 10,000 T17s. This massive addition to the company’s already burgeoning fleet of miners has seen it grow by a monumental 240%. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Mike Edwards, CEO of Argo Blockchain, elaborated on the achievement of the T17s.

“Overall, we are very pleased with the performance and stability of the 17 series miners, and we believe that the T17 represent the best combination between efficiency and price per petahash.”

It’s perhaps no wonder Argo feels a need to increase their miner armada, an escalation of mining power has been increasingly evidenced over the past few years. Bitcoin’s hash rate — a measure of the combined processing capability of the network — has grown exponentially in the last decade, hitting a milestone 100 exahashes per second (EH/s) a little over two months ago.

With this increase in hash rate comes an increase in mining difficulty, a calibration of the network takes place every 2016 blocks to accommodate the new power within it. This adjustment protocol is primarily in place to combat inflation. However, as a consequence, rising difficulty shrinks miner profit margins, requiring the use of more powerful machines to remain profitable — thus continuing the cycle.

Is Bitcoin mining still profitable?

Mining profitability isn’t all about the equipment; there’s a delicate equilibrium that needs to be struck between the mining difficulty, the cost of electricity and the price of Bitcoin. The latter two are particularly integral.

For example, the lower the cost of power, the more profit can be gleaned from mining — even with less efficient equipment. On the flip side, with the proper arsenal, a mining outfit can outweigh the drawbacks of high electricity tariffs by maximizing their hashing power and capitalizing on the economy of scale.

However, one of the biggest hurdles to mining profitability is ultimately Bitcoin’s ever-shifting value. For many miners, this was a painful lesson to learn. Back during the bear winter of 2018, numerous crypto prospectors were forced to switch off as the delicate equilibrium between price and profitability skewed out of balance.

As Bitcoin slowly receded into the low four-figure mark, several mining operations were driven below their break-even point. A mass capitulation of miners was witnessed around November 2018, shortly after Bitcoin’s fatal plunge below $6,000 a month prior.

An estimated 600,000 to 800,000 Bitcoin miners shut down as profitability waned. As a result, hash rate incurred a 46% drop, declining from around 58 EH/s at the beginning of November to approximately 31 EH/s at the start of December.

Mining is often a double-edged sword. In a bull market, profitability can be immense, with the limit set as high as BTC is willing to go. Contrastingly, a bear market, as depicted throughout 2018, can offer disastrous consequences. Bitcoin’s volatility is both a curse and a blessing — for Edwards the latter is more accurate:

“Bitcoin is still very much in its infancy as a currency and asset class, having only been created just over 10 years ago. This makes it challenging to value. Volatility creates interesting opportunities in the short-term, but we expect this to reduce significantly in the coming years.”

As to whether Bitcoin’s volatility impacts mining profitability, Philip Salter, head of mining operations at Genesis mining, provided a temperate response to Cointelegraph: “Yes and no. Volatility means uncertainty but it’s possible to eliminate most risks by planning well and analyzing the market.”

Not everyone made it out of the bear market unscathed. Bitmain, for example, was hit hard. Despite accruing record profits from 2017 into early 2018, the mining firm had to cut 50% of its workforce and close multiple offices to keep its head above water. Shortly after Bitcoin’s hash rate lull in November, both network power and price regained, signalling a distinct sign of miners re-entering the space.

Related: The Dangers of Mining Pools: Centralization and Security Issues

As of right now, mining profitability for some seems to be reasonably stable, even in the wake of a protracted bear cycle. Edwards confirmed this, noting that mining this year has been reasonably fruitful, “We have found Bitcoin mining to be very profitable in 2019 and are expecting this to continue into 2020.”

Retail miners are still suffering

While things may be golden for larger mining firms, smaller mining outfits are likely not faring quite as well. According to bitinfocharts, overall mining profitability has shrunk by 64% from its peak back in June. This is likely a direct result of increasing mining difficulty, which is up 85% for the same time frame.

Clearly, with hash rate on the rise, the accelerating difficulty is pricing retail miners out. Edwards highlighted this occurrence, noting the several market advantages mining firms have over smaller operations, “It is becoming extremely difficult for individuals and small miners to remain profitable, as the system currently favour large-scale mining.” Salter also agrees with the sentiment:

“Small miners usually don’t get industrial power rates and generally don’t benefit from economies of scale like large players do. Depending on the local conditions, it’s still possible to make money as a small scale miner, but we can expect to see larger operations to take over more and more market share.”

Bitcoin is 85% complete

On Oct. 18, 2019, the 18 millionth Bitcoin was hashed into existence, leaving only 3 million BTC left to mine of its 21 million cap. But what does this mean for mining profitability?

Contrary to common sense, the fact that Bitcoin is 85% mined doesn’t actually impact miners whatsoever — not directly at least. While 15% doesn’t seem like much, due to the quasi-monetary policy instilled by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the remaining BTC could take more than 100 years to yield, and it’s all thanks to the Bitcoin halving.

As its name suggests, the reward for mining a single block is cut in half for every 210,000 blocks mined. This has the effect of staving off hyperinflation by keeping the circulating supply under control.

Bitcoin has undergone two halvings already. Its first event, back in 2012, saw the mining reward cut from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC, the second witnessed a further reward reduction to 12.5 BTC per block. Bitcoin’s next halving is scheduled for May 2020, decreasing the mining reward to just 6.25 BTC.

While the idea of halving is a stroke of genius when it comes to supply and demand economics, the effect on miners isn’t so rosy. As the reward halves, so too will miner profits — that is, unless Bitcoin’s price meets some lofty expectations.

For Edwards, these expectations are bound to be met based on past events, explaining, “Increased scarcity caused by a halving has been a catalyst for a BTC price increase.” However, there are also many other factors at play. He also opined that the least efficient miners, some of whom could still be running five-year-old S9 Antminers, will eventually be priced out of the market.

Salters suggests that the only way Bitcoin mining could ever become “unsustainable” is if Bitcoin itself becomes worthless. Although, he hastens to add that due to the decentralized nature of the token, this risk is close to zero. As for Bitcoin nearing its total market cap, Salter notes that transaction fees multiplied by the growing number of transactions will compensate for the lower returns form verifying blocks, adding:

“The mining revenue is dependent on the number of coins mined multiplied with the Bitcoin price. So those two factors need to be looked at together to reach any conclusion.”

The endgame is near?

Profitability is, of course, subjective, based on multiple wide-ranging variables. However, for many retail miners, reward halving coinciding without a significant price rise will have debilitating consequences.

If, for example, Bitcoin’s price stays relatively stable or drops before May 2020, many retail investors will be forced out. This will leave only the largest mining firms and pools left to compete, inevitably risking the centralization of Bitcoin.

Nonetheless, thanks to Satoshi’s brilliant design, not all is lost. A mass exodus of retail miners would undoubtedly trigger a difficulty recalibration, allowing smaller outfits a route back to profitability. However, as Edwards notes, this won’t last forever, and miners will be forced to turn to a new form of incentive:

“Over time, the market will exclude the least efficient miners and the diminishing mining block rewards will slowly be replaced by fees collected from user transactions.”

So it seems that in spite of fate’s best efforts to ensure the contrary, mining will live on, and the industry will continue to turn a fair profit. As for retail miners, however, their days appear to be numbered.",

Cryptocurrency and bitcoin proponents have been patiently waiting to see if crypto winter is returning as the recent price decline has shaken investors. Digital assets have been meandering aimlessly over the last week and in order to gain some perspective, it’s always good to study the last decade of previous bear market trends.

Crypto Prices Slide Again, Making Traders Question Whether Crypto Winter Is Really Over

After BTC and other digital currencies touched all-time highs in 2017, the following months ushered in ‘crypto winter.’ It was a cold period of time where crypto investors watched their favorite cryptocurrencies lose 70-95% in value. Since then, prices have headed northbound and many people started to assume that the bearish crypto winter may be coming to an end. However, after BTC jumped from the $3k range to almost $14k in the spring, the digital currency has dropped to the $7k zone and is now hovering between $8,800-9,150. Overall, most traders would consider the overall upswing bullish as BTC was $6,350 on November 8 last year and today the price is $8,942 per coin. But many crypto winters in the past and bearish cycles have seen slight upswings before plummeting back down and continuing an even longer bear market trend. The recent decline in crypto values has caused some digital currency investors to panic and current prices have made them wonder if more trouble lies ahead.

The first long bear market that BTC fans witnessed was between June to November in 2011 that spanned roughly 162 days. The digital currency’s value had spiked in the summer of 2011 to a high of $31.50, but subsequently dropped over the course of the next few months to a low of $2.01 per BTC, losing 93%. At this time, things started looking positive for BTC investors similar to the run-up in 2019. BTC was hovering around $7.08 per coin on January 11, 2012, gaining more than 250%. But thanks to all the exchange hacks in 2012 like Linode and Bitcoinica and the regulatory issues with the platform Trade Hill, BTC’s price dipped into a bear market trend for roughly 185 days, losing 40%. In July 2012 the price per BTC was $4.22, but again traders started seeing bullish trends transpire and the value jumped 216% to a high of $13.35 per coin in August.

Just like the current 2019 bear raid, crypto traders saw BTC prices slide 37% to a low of $8.40 during the first week of December 2012. The duration of the rout lasted 111 days and was allegedly initiated by the second Bitcoinica hacks and the lawsuits surrounding the events. However, the following January to November 29, 2013 saw BTC values jump considerably again touching a peak price of $1,166. The first recorded price on Coinmarketcap.com’s historical price index shows BTC was $135 in April 2013. However, the party ended in December 2013 and the onset of the first extremely long crypto winter started eating away at the bullish prices. The bear market stretched for 410 days encompassing 2014 in its entirety. Moreover, other digital currencies that saw higher prices also followed BTC’s dive as most cryptos that year lost more than 80%. After the $1,166 high, BTC dropped to a low of $197 per coin during the first week of January 2015. From that period in time, anyone could have purchased BTC at prices between $197 to $300 up until October 28, 2015.

BTC prices starting from Halloween to mid-June 2016 were between $300 to $600 and the coin started inching its way closer to the 2013 all-time high (ATH) in January 2017. After that price surpassed the 2013 ATH, BTC and many other cryptocurrencies saw a climactic run up from that point forward. On the exchange Bitstamp, BTC touched its highest position ever at roughly $19,650 per coin. The bear market that followed lasted much longer than the 2013-2015 downtrend of 410 days. Coincidently, using that same timeframe from December 2017 to the first week of February 2019 saw BTC prices reduced to $3,484 per coin that week. The bear market stretch continued, making the crypto winter following 2017 the longest ever. Between February through May 2019, prices hovered around $3,500 to $6,000 and the run-up since then looks like a second breath of fresh air.

The latest downtrend has dampened enthusiasm throughout the crypto community after BTC values were hovering around $10k, but are now below the $9k region as prices sink lower. The last few months have seen digital currencies traverse upwards in a bullish manner, but prices could easily follow the same dynamics that transpired years ago. The bear markets in the past did see some positive optimism after BTC’s value plummeted, however, some of the run-ups didn’t last very long. Digital currencies had a much better year in 2019 but as the end of the year approaches, people are still uncertain about how crypto markets will trend over the next month and a half into 2020.

Speaking in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Wray responded to questions from U.S. Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) about cryptocurrency, law enforcement and terrorist deterrence, saying:

“We are looking at it from an investigative perspective, including tools that we have to follow the money even in this new world that we’re living in.”

Wray supported Romney’s line of questioning concerning terrorist financing, saying that U.S. adversaries are becoming “more facile with technology and particular various types of technology that anonymize their efforts.”

It’s not just crypto, however. Wray noted encryption is touching every aspect of emerging tech such as instant communications:

“Whether its cryptocurrency, whether it’s default encryption on devices and messaging platforms; we are moving as a country and world in a direction where if we don’t get our act together money, people, communication, evidence, facts, all the bread and butter for all of us to do our work will be essentially walled off from the men and women we represent.”

In 2018, the FBI said it had an estimated 130 cases involving crypto under investigation, from human trafficking to ransomware. And, this May, the FBI shut down DeepDotWeb, a dark web market place which solicited some services in cryptocurrency.

Cryptocurrency holders have long wrestled with their tax obligations. These fiduciary duties have been complicated by tax agencies, which are several steps behind technology and now playing crypto catch-up. Updated guidelines from the U.S. and U.K.’s tax agencies were finally released this year, but the initial relief felt by conscientious bitcoiners was to prove short-lived, for on closer examination, the documentation has left many crypto questions unanswered.

It’s 2019 and Tax Is Still Taxing

The lack of uniformity regarding tax on crypto earnings, with some national governments happy to kick the can down the road and others determined to immediately collect their pound of flesh is frustrating, to put it mildly. The latest guidelines from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) for U.K. residents has succeeded in muddying the already-feculent waters.

Once again, a tax authority’s attempt to provide clarity on crypto taxation has become, instead, a wellspring of uncertain questions. It was the same when the IRS published crypto tax guidance in 2014, and again in October of this year. So, why are such powerful arms of the state unable to lay down clearly-defined tax principles on virtual currency? Is it because the powers-that-be do not fully comprehend this rapidly-evolving environment or its underlying technology? Or is it the case that the nature of forks, airdrops and token sales is incompatible with hard-and-fast taxation rules?

Robin Singh is the founder of crypto tax platform Koinly. “Part of the problem,” he explains, “is that regulators do not understand cryptocurrencies. In the latest IRS guidelines, for example, the IRS refers to forked coins as “airdrops after a fork”. They are oblivious to the fact that there is no actual airdrop – the ledger is simply copied. This misinterpretation has given rise to the issue investors now face: paying income tax on forked coins they may have no intentions of using.”

Exchange Tokens ‘Aren’t Currency’

HMRC’s recent update to its guidance on crypto taxes, published on November 1, dealt with crypto transactions carried out by companies, businesses such as partnerships and sole traders, and individuals. In essence, it sought to end confusion about the extent to which cryptocurrency transactions occasion capital gains tax, national insurance contributions, corporation tax, VAT, and income tax.

The main plank of HMRC’s argument is that, generally speaking, “exchange tokens” are not currencies, stock or marketable securities – meaning they are exempt from stamp taxes. Nevertheless, tokens used in debt transactions do incur stamp taxes.

Bitcoin is explicitly mentioned in the policy paper as an example of an exchange token, with security and utility tokens to be dealt with in a future update. Despite the policy paper being entitled “Tax on cryptoassets,” therefore, it is far from comprehensive. And, to quote an instructive line, “The tax policy may evolve as the sector develops.”

Crypto Tax Obligations for Individuals

As it has previously, HMRC was keen to point out that “the tax treatment of all types of tokens is dependent on the nature and use of the token and not the definition of the token.” In other words, it’s up to you whether you incur any tax at all.

If you sell exchange tokens that have appreciated in value, they will – as investments – be liable to capital gains tax; income tax and national insurance contributions are also due on crypto assets received from employers as a form of non-cash payment and from mining operations or airdrops.

In instances where individuals essentially act as a business by frequently transacting financial trades involving crypto assets, their taxable trading profits are subject to income tax rather than capital gains tax. Of course, you can reduce your tax liability by offsetting losses against future profits; the cost of the asset itself can be a deduction.

A Thankless Task for Tax Agencies

Because assets such as bitcoin are traded on exchanges which do not use pounds sterling, HMRC’s guidance notes that the value of any gain or loss must be converted to sterling on an individual’s self assessment tax return. The guidance points out that individuals must keep separate records of each crypto asset transaction including type of asset; date of transaction; if they were bought or sold; number of units and value of transaction in sterling; cumulative total of the investment units held; and bank statements and wallet addresses.

Of course, it is easy to pick holes in the guidance. The tax body says that reasonable care should be taken to make “appropriate valuations” for transactions using a consistent methodology. However, it fails to elaborate on what would be appropriate, and which methodology would be permissible. The HMRC also betrays its own ignorance when discussing matters of fraud in the cryptosphere, noting that theft is not considered disposal “as the individual still owns the assets and has a right to recover them.” They may have a right to recover them, but they probably have no prospect of doing so. Victims of theft cannot claim a loss in capital gains tax either.

Crypto Tax Obligations for Businesses

HMRC’s guidance for businesses is, as you might expect, even more complex and confusing than for individuals. Crypto mining companies are subject to tax based on factors including degree and frequency of activity, level of organization, risk and commerciality. But most business activities in the cryptosphere are subject to some form of tax, whether the activity is buying and selling tokens, exchanging tokens for other assets (including other forms of cryptocurrency) and supplying goods and services in return for tokens, the latter of which entails VAT on the “pound sterling value of the exchange tokens at the point the transaction takes place.”

Confusion stems from qualifiers such as “the type of tax will depend on who is involved in the business,” although the process by which accounts should be prepared is, at least, unambiguous: they should follow generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) or, if relevant, international accounting standards (IAS).

If a business’s activities constitute a trade, receipts and expenses form part of the calculation of the resulting profit. If a partnership conducts the trade, partners will be taxed on their share of the trading profit. And if the activity concerning the exchange token is not deemed “trading activity,” the gain obtained from eventually disposing of a crypto asset will be charged to corporation tax.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The fact that the status of security and utility tokens remains unaddressed indicates that HMRC is continuing to wrestle with fundamental questions about tax on crypto. While these latest directives do answer some long-held queries pertaining to “exchange tokens,” they also throw up others. Is HMRC open to eventually changing their stance that cryptocurrency is not money, for instance? This one will be asked ad infinitum, particularly as merchant adoption increases. For bitcoiners in the U.K., U.S., and other leading crypto countries, divining the intent of the tax agencies has become a dark art.

According to an announcement from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Nov. 7, the regulator has approved the transfer of a swap execution facility (SEF) registration from fellow New York-based financial services firm trueEX to Tassat.

Tassat had first reached the agreement in principle to acquire — subject to CFTC approval — trueEx’s SEF registration back in July of this year.

The company is now waiting for news regarding its prospective acquisition of trueEx’s Designated Contract Market (DCM) registration, which would allow it to operate an exchange listing futures or options contracts with oversight from the CFTC.

Physically-delivered BTC derivatives for institutional investors

In its press release, the CFTC stated that trueEX and Tassat fulfilled the requirement for transferring a SEF registration by providing evidence that Tassat would be able to operate in compliance with the provisions of the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and related CFTC regulations.

The agency revealed that there are now a total of 19 registered SEFs, including Tassat, and noted that TrueEX had been granted its registration as a SEF by the CFTC on Jan. 22, 2016.

The registration brings Tassat closer to launching a crypto derivatives exchange with full oversight from the CFTC, where it hopes to list physically-delivered Bitcoin (BTC) derivatives for institutional investors. As CEO Thomas Kim said in July when the plans were first unveiled:

“Adding the exchange to our ecosystem delivers a complete end-to-end offering, currently unavailable today, that encompasses tokenization, payments, market data and settlement for the benefit of our clients and partners.”

Regulated offerings

In March, Tassat — when it was still known as trueDigital — had partnered with crypto data firm Kaiko and digital assets analytics company Inca Digital Securities to widen the distribution of its over-the-counter reference rates for Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), the latter of which it created in partnership with ConsenSys.

TrueDigital was initially established as a subsidiary of TrueEx, which has long been active in the crypto space and was the first in the industry to secure a DCM registration for Bitcoin swaps from the CFTC back in 2012.

This summer, another crypto exchange ErisX, procured a derivatives clearing organization license from the CFTC as part of its plans to make digital asset futures contracts available for trade on its regulated derivatives market later this year.",,https://fcw.com/articles/2019/11/08/crypto-tracking-how-johnson.aspx?m=1,"Law Enforcement

Cryptocurrency tracking improves -- but how?

The IRS and other tax enforcement agencies are touting big improvements in tracing the use of cryptocurrencies in tax evasion and other criminal schemes. They just don't want to talk about how.

On Friday, officials from the J5, a cooperative consortium of tax investigation and enforcement agencies around the world that includes Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the U.S., wrapped up a week-long event in Los Angeles that brought together criminal investigators, cryptocurrency experts and data scientists.

The J5 was formed last year to help pool international tax enforcement resources and strategies. As the internet and the emergence of decentralized, pseudo-anonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have made it easier for tax evaders to move and hide their money, investigation and enforcement agencies around the globe have slowly realized they are dealing with a common set of challenges.

""The goal of the week was to remove some barriers and work together collaboratively to identify the most egregious tax offenders in the world,"" said Ryan Korner, executive special agent for the IRS field office in Los Angeles. ""I want to emphasize that this week was not just a hypothetical training exercise; all of the participants ... worked together using real data to identify real criminals.""

However, the agencies were more tight-lipped when it came to discussing what those leads are, how agencies are making new use of data and what tools they're leveraging. IRS officials said they developed new analysis platforms, generated ""dozens"" of new leads and were getting close to announcing operational results from the partnership, but offered few specifics on their work or what new capabilities they have developed to track cryptocurrency.

""I don't want to necessarily name any of them specifically, but we do have the tools in place today that we didn't have in place even six months to a year ago to take what was an anonymous form of payment and moving funds and really make it so it's not anonymous anymore,"" Korner told FCW.

IRS Special Agent Chris Hueston, the J5 project lead for the U.S., did cite enhanced data-sharing practices among partner countries as one of the reasons behind the improvement.

""We're able to use some of the data that we've seized through investigations, and we're able to rely on some of our J5 countries for data that they're able to share with us, so once we put those datasets together, as well as open sources and other information that we're able to … share legally, those datasets become richer as far as putting a finer point on our targeting efforts for those criminals,"" he said.

The emergence of decentralized, pseudo-anonymous cryptocurrencies have created new challenges for financial regulators and tax enforcement agencies, who initially struggled to track and trace payments. A 2017 survey of 564 Bitcoin investors conducted by The Motley Fool found that more than one-third reported they did not plan to report their earnings for capital gains taxation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress that new currencies like Facebook's Libra raise ""serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection [and] financial stability.""

While IRS officials were reluctant to discuss what tools they're using, there is evidence that law enforcement agencies are getting better at tracking cryptocurrencies. For example, the Department of Justice has cited the tracking of virtual currencies as a key component for takedowns of a massive child exploitation ring in October.

The use of new commercial software and algorithms may be fueling that improvement. At least two agencies, the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, have engaged in sole-source procurements in recent years with contractor Chainalysis for proprietary software and training on how to track the use of virtual currency. In both cases, the agencies argue the contractor is the only company capable of providing the services.

""The vast majority of FBI personnel investigating conduct involving virtual currency only have access to Chainalysis to perform bitcoin tracing,"" the FBI wrote in an August 2018 sole-source justification.",2019-11-08,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-based-commerce-spikes-65-in-7-months/,"Crypto-Based Commerce Spikes 65% in 7 Months

Commerce fueled by cryptocurrencies has once again started to grow. Data collected by blockchain forensics company Chainalysis shows a significant increase of volume in the first half of the year. The positive change coincided with the remarkable market recovery that followed last year’s prolonged crypto winter.

$5.5 Million of Crypto Used in Commerce Daily

After a string of depressing months in 2018, cryptocurrency-based commerce began to rise again in 2019, the study quoted by Bloomberg indicates. According to New York-headquartered Chainalysis, the amount of cryptocurrency sent to 16 merchant service providers such as Bitpay increased by 65% between January and July. During the same period, the price of bitcoin core (BTC) tripled to over $12,000.

This year’s positive trend contrasts with the findings from last year, when Chainalysis registered a decline in bitcoin-related trade. The company’s 2019 research covers not only commerce based on BTC but also payments in bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC) and the stablecoin tether (USDT). These cryptocurrencies, the report notes, are used to fund everything from online gambling to purchases at pot shops.

According to Kim Grauer, senior economist at Chainalysis, the increase in bitcoin-denominated trade suggests that there is more trust in crypto now. The overall amount of cryptocurrency used in commerce remains small, the publication acknowledges, but yet it grew from around $3 million daily in January to $5.5 million per day on average in July.

The volume is likely to expand further as platforms like Bitpay, which allows merchants to accept payments in BCH and BTC, introduce support for more digital coins in the future. The company, which processes over $1 billion in transactions annually, expects continued growth as new currencies are added including ether (ETH) and ripple (XRP), spokesperson Jan Jahosky told Bloomberg.

Slow Transactions Are a Major Hurdle to Adoption

Various cryptocurrencies differ in many ways and the authors point out that inconvenience related to certain specifics has been a major barrier to the growth of crypto payments. For example, transaction confirmation on the BTC network can take up to an hour, making it hard for people to just walk in a store, buy a cup of coffee and leave, the article notes.

The characteristic volatility of most digital assets is also a negative factor and many businesses and consumers are still reluctant to deal in crypto for that reason. At the same time, the researchers have found a five-fold increase in the use of tether during the examined period. According to Chainalysis, the stablecoin whose price is pegged to the U.S. dollar accounted for 9% of all commerce during the seven months covered in the study.

In reality, a growing number of merchants accept direct cryptocurrency payments. For instance, the Bitcoin Cash Map application now lists 1,769 locations of brick and mortar stores that let you pay with BCH. And according to a recent report by marketing analysis company Semrush, quoted by La Stampa daily, cryptocurrency is the third-most popular online payment method in Italy. Bitcoin is behind only Paypal and Postepay, while it is more widespread in Italian ecommerce than direct payments with any of the major credit cards.

The Silicon Valley venture capital firm is launching a school to coach entrepreneurs on building blockchain and cryptocurrency companies, Andreessen Horowitz announced Friday. The firm, founded by Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreesseen, has been one of the most active mainstream investors in the space with a dedicated $350 million fund launched last year. It's also a founding member of the Libra Association — the controversial cryptocurrency project spearheaded by Facebook.

While bitcoin is still the most popular use case for blockchain technology, general partner and co-head of the crypto fund Chris Dixon said he sees value beyond digital money. Of the technologies he has come across, Dixon ""strongly believes"" crypto could ""have the most impact in the world.""

""If this works the way we hope it does, it will be a new way to build start-up,"" Dixon told CNBC in a phone interview. ""You can build social networks and marketplaces using a lot of these concepts that have pretty profound business and social societal implications.""

Dixon, who is on the board of Coinbase, said there are ""no strings attached"" for founders, and they won't need to give up an equity stake to participate. The seven-week free course, first announced at TechCrunch Disrupt earlier this year, will officially kick off in February and teach roughly 40 entrepreneurs about technology. When it wraps up, the courses will be available online for free.

""Our general view is if we build goodwill, people will want to come to work with us — so it's in that spirit,"" Dixon said. ""If they do go start a company, we hope we'll be one of their first phone calls but there's no requirement for that.""

Andreessen is taking seven- to ten-year bets and investing in both equity in companies and digital currencies themselves. Those crypto investments have also reportedly slowed down in the past year. Andreessen Horowitz participated in 14 funding rounds with an total value of roughly $850 million last year, according to Crunchbase. This year, Crunchbase said it has backed five deals with a total value just over $75 million.

To make these bets, the firm moved away from the majority of its Sand Hill Road neighbors to instead become a registered investment advisor, or RIA. Another general partner and former U.S. Department of Justice prosecutor Katie Haun, who co-heads the crypto fund, told CNBC earlier this year that the firm tries to ignore the price of some digital assets they hold, which are known for volatility. Bitcoin in particular is down more than 50% from its all-time high.

Navigating regulation will be a key topic of the course. The topic caught the attention of lawmakers and global regulators after Facebook and roughly two dozen announced a plan to launch a global cryptocurrency, libra. Congress members from both political parties highlighted potential downsides in Facebook's ambitions, and potential illicit uses for digital currencies. Multiple initial members — including PayPal, Visa and MasterCard — have since backed out of the project. Andreessen Horowitz signed Libra's charter and is ""very excited as part of it, and optimistic"" about its role as a founding member,"" Dixon said.

""I understand that there are issues to work through,"" Dixon said. ""When these brand new areas emerge, no one including the regulators understands what the best practices are — it takes time for respective parties to come together and figure out how to balance innovation and consumer protection.""",2019-11-08,https://www.coindesk.com/podcast-josh-brown-on-why-bitcoin-is-like-the-1800s-railroad-boom,"“In the 1800s we had a bubble in railroads, and almost every one of them went bankrupt,” said “Downtown” Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management. “But what was left behind in the wake of that financial wreckage were the tracks, and the trains, and the stations, and the expertise to build more.”

That’s the analogy Brown sees with the bitcoin bubble of 2017, as explained in a recent episode of Bitcoin Macro, a pop-up podcast series featuring speakers from CoinDesk’s upcoming Invest: NYC conference on Tuesday, Nov. 12.

“Eventually the technology [railroads] found a way to be profitable, useful, and became woven into the fabric of our society,” Brown said. “So it’s possible that the crypto investments people made in 2017 were stupid, but that they had the right idea.”

The last six months have seen a growing dialogue between the bitcoin industry and leaders in global finance. No longer written off as some ignorable niche, increasingly people are asking: Is bitcoin a macro asset? Is it a safe-haven asset? How will it perform in the next recession?

Brown is a regular contributor to CNBC. In this episode of Bitcoin Macro, CoinDesk’s head of strategy, Nolan Bauerle, talks with Brown about:

Why bitcoin feels like a protest asset but doesn’t see huge amounts of capital flowing into it from turbulent regions.

Why U.S. dollars and assets like Manhattan real estate are still the top options for moving wealth out of countries.

Why it’s impossible to know how bitcoin will react in a recession given the unique set of circumstances surrounding the market’s past 11 years.

Why the bitcoin and crypto spaces have veered back and forth between overly optimistic and overly pessimistic.

Why true technology disruptions tend to happen long after their earliest promoters have left the stage.

Why the impact of bitcoin may be something very different than the macro, non-sovereign money narrative in favor today.

Last year he came back to let the audience know what asset managers are really concerned about when it comes to cryptocurrencies in general. And this year he’s going to involve himself as our master of ceremonies, and we’ll introduce all of our great panelists, and we’re happy to have him. So crossover star, I think, is a good way to describe you. A lot of people know you over crypto, but you’re certainly well known for your mainstream financial news.

Josh Brown: (01:48)

Hi Nolan, it’s great to be with you.

Nolan Bauerle: (01:50)

Great to have you aboard. So we’re going to jump right in. This podcast is really all about bitcoin. And the first question is about bitcoin behaving as a macro asset. So you’ve seen a lot of what’s going on in the world today. You’re pretty plugged in. How do you see bitcoin fitting in here? Is it an actual asset that you can see as a way to hedge macroeconomic changes? Or is it sort of still in the wings waiting to be built up and mature a little more before it’s really in the major leagues of macro assets?

Josh Brown: (02:24)

As I said to you just prior to recording, I see myself as more of a student than a teacher in this realm, but I’m an apt pupil, and I try to pay attention to various opinions and, of course, look at charts and price action. And I try my best to understand what’s happening. To answer that question directly, I would say I do not believe that bitcoin behaves in any way like a macro asset. And the only reason I’m saying that is because we have no evidence that it’s correlated with any other macro development. In other words, I wish I could say when … Think about gold. When people are worried about inflation, and I’m not saying gold is a great inflation hedge, but when people are worried about it, there are trades where you can see flows go into that asset class. It’s demonstrative.

Josh Brown: (03:21)

So you could say whether or not you think gold is an inflation hedge, you know that other people do, and it acts that way. Think about utility stocks. All year long, the story has been the federal reserve about to lower rates, now they’re lowering rates. Maybe they’re going to lower rates more. And as that process has happened, you’ve seen money flow into utility stocks, which are prized for their high yields. So if you’re not getting yields in bonds, what’s the next best thing or the next, next best thing? It’s high yielding equities, and utilities are considered to be among the safest high yielding stocks. So you could say that, that’s a macro asset. What can we say about bitcoin that’s even close to being comparable? In the month of October, I think it’s a world record of people around the world involved in various protests, whether we’re talking about Santiago, or we’re talking about what’s going on in Hong Kong. All over the world, there are millions and millions of people taking to the streets.

Josh Brown: (04:20)

Why isn’t bitcoin up 50% if in fact it’s a protest asset? Well, it isn’t, so I don’t know. If we’re worried about disinflation and we say that maybe people, if they’re scared of their own currency, there’ll be this huge rush into bitcoin. Well, where is that happening? It isn’t. So I would love to be able to answer in the affirmative and say, “Yes, bitcoin has now taken its place among the Pantheon of asset classes that people can use to express a macro view.” But it just isn’t, there’s no evidence for that. So my answer to you is no it isn’t, but maybe that’ll change at some point.

Nolan Bauerle: (04:57)

Yeah. And that you’re focusing on the behavior I think is the important part here. A lot of people get caught up with what they want it to be and they sort of will fall into kind of a bubble, where they see it behaving in ways that maybe it isn’t actually, given the facts, and that you underlined here that the behavior of it, given all these conditions is pretty clear. It looks like a speculative asset that people are interested in making some money on, and certainly there needs to be a high risk tolerance to get exposure even to this day.

Josh Brown: (05:29)

If we’re saying that bitcoin’s most obvious use case is the ability to get out of a fiat currency and move money out of a country, or … it’s got huge competition. US dollars are what people want all over the world. In Asia, maybe they want the yen when they fear for the safety of the currency, or the capital markets, or the economy in which they live. This is a fact, and then if we’re saying, “Well, people are going to use bitcoin when they want to get out of the denomination of whatever their country is”, or the jurisdiction. They want to, I don’t want to use the word hide money, but they want to literally move money where it can’t be touched. Well, real estate has been a much, much more prominent way to do that. Look at Vancouver, half the buildings are Chinese money.

Josh Brown: (06:21)

Look at the towers they’re putting up in New York. They just put the capstone, I think it’s called, or whatever. They just put the cap on something called Central Park tower. I think it’s 1400 feet high. It’s the tallest residential building in the Western hemisphere. It’s only going to have 70 something apartments. So who’s buying those apartments? Well, it’s not like a guy who’s a lawyer in New York City. These are $7, $10, $20, $50 million apartments. You could think about these as safe deposit boxes for Russians, Indians, Chinese, people that are trying to have assets outside of the country. Nobody’s even going to live in half these apartments. And that’s just one tower of five that I could reference off the top of my head.

Nolan Bauerle: (07:10)

The one they built on Lexington, the skinnier one that went up earlier, I can’t remember the name right now, but you can see the windows are empty. The lights are off every single night.

Josh Brown: (07:19)

Of course. You want to laugh? When they built 437 Park, which I think was the largest until this new one, the tallest, they did something for New York City called a traffic study. So if you want to build something of size, you have to spend millions of dollars and a couple of years studying what the impact will be on local traffic. And the joke is there ain’t going to be no fucking traffic, because no one’s going to live there. So that is the way you’re seeing foreign nationals move money out of their currency, or out of their government’s jurisdiction and into what they consider to be a safer place. And you’re just not seeing those dollar flows into bitcoin to the same extent. So it’s hard to make the case that functionally that’s what’s really happening there.

Nolan Bauerle: (08:05)

And you mentioned something that I hadn’t really heard before. We call it a safe-haven asset, but you called it a protest asset as well. And I think that’s a really interesting label, and that its behavior really hasn’t mimicked what you’d expect from a protest asset. Now I saw it traded at a premium when the Hong Kong protests began, it traded about a $100 premium. And that was really because people were worried about using their Oyster cards, their Metro cards to get home back to China if they’re going to the mainland, because they were going to get tracked, and basically just really worried about local dollars being tracked. But we haven’t really seen that premium stick, and we haven’t really seen that sort of flow towards using this so that you’re not surveyed and you’re not spied on so they know where your simple consumption dollars had gone.

Josh Brown: (08:52)

Somebody was telling me about Venezuela, and I’m aware of what’s going on in the economy there, and it’s been going on for years. And hyperinflation, the collapse of institutions, people starving. It’s a horrible, horrible situation. Now, if you were to tell me 30% of all Venezuelans have moved their money from the local currency into bitcoin, then I would shut my mouth and I would say, “Okay, there’s something substantial here.” But I don’t think that’s the case, do you?

Nolan Bauerle: (09:24)

No, I mean, and we’ve seen Turkey, for example, has seen a lot of users, let’s say buyer [inaudible 00:09:32].

Josh Brown: (09:32)

Yeah. Great example. Another inflationary situation where people for political reasons want assets out of that country, and the local currency and economy is collapsing.

Nolan Bauerle: (09:44)

Yeah. But, like you’re saying, we just haven’t seen that kind of use.

Josh Brown: (09:48)

Yeah. Where is it, where is it? When does it start? So I’m not saying it can’t, I’m just saying I’m not seeing it.

Nolan Bauerle: (09:54)

Now moving onto a recession. A lot of rumors of recessions, we’re still doing pretty well here in the United States, but it’s certainly crept in, in other jurisdictions. So we’ve seen this sort of cheap money around the world for a long time, and it looks like even from high risk tolerance from the VC side of things, because money, it’s just available and it looks like every idea out there is funded and the risk tolerance has grown to a certain extent here. Now, if that changes, if a recession does cause some kind of liquidity crunch, or some inability to get access to this cheap money again, how do you think bitcoin behaves?

Josh Brown: (10:34)

I guess we have no … in the United States, we have no prior history of it, so we’ll say we’ve been in expansion for 11 years, so it’s the longest expansion ever. So I don’t know the answer.

Nolan Bauerle: (10:49)

Yeah, well they’re-

Josh Brown: (10:50)

We’ll find out.

Nolan Bauerle: (10:53)

And my final question for you, and really this is sort of tapping on your exposure to mainstream media, mainstream financial world. Bitcoin really popped in everyone’s consciousness in 2017 when I met you at that great dinner that we had down near Chinatown. And you wrote a beautiful blog post. I thought it was … I really realized what a fantastic writer you were.

Josh Brown: (11:16)

Ah, thank you.

Nolan Bauerle: (11:17)

I think it was something into [inaudible 00:11:18], and it was great.

Josh Brown: (11:19)

Yeah. Yeah.

Nolan Bauerle: (11:21)

So here it is. It popped into world consciousness in 2017. Everyone started talking about it, and it’s already mutated a few times in people’s minds since then. In the last six months though, what have you seen that’s changed, or if anything, is it just the same old story?

Josh Brown: (11:35)

So when I was a keynote speaker in the closing panel of Consensus: Invest 2017 the first year, the audience was filled with young people, primarily, mostly dudes, and they had made a lot of money. I think the price of bitcoin at that time was $15,000 or $16,000, and my message to that audience at that time was, “calm down.” It’s okay to feel like you’re missing out. You don’t have to do something just because everyone else is doing it and they seem to be getting rich. And of course, it would only take a couple of weeks for that to look like really good advice. But that is always good advice. Maybe now we’re in the polar opposite situation, where instead of fear of missing out, there’s this just incredible amount of pessimism that everything that people thought would be true about digital currencies, and cryptography, and blockchain is now like a joke in the mainstream financial media, or at least it’s being derided on a daily basis.

Josh Brown: (12:47)

And so maybe now things have gotten too pessimistic. And the only other example of this kind of thing that I could think of for my own career and experience, I remember my formative years in the industry we were doing the dot com bubble, and everything came apart relatively quickly. It only took from March of 2000 to, let’s say, the end of 2001 for people to just be completely wiped out, not just in financial terms, although they were, but emotionally, and mentally. And just nobody wanted to hear anything about technology ever again. And in the ashes of that experience, Google was born. In the ashes of that experience very quietly with very little fanfare Steve jobs rejoined Apple as the CEO. The seeds for the technology boom that we’ve now been living through over the last, let’s call it 12 years or 15 years, were born in the ashes of that prior mania.

Josh Brown: (13:52)

So I think statistically, spiritually, any way you want to look at it, there was absolutely a bubble in anything related to crypto going into the end of the year of 2017. I don’t think anyone would deny that it was insane just as the internet mania, but the thing is all of the predictions that were made about the transformative power of the internet actually ended up coming true. It just took longer than what people expected, and the companies involved were very different. If you think about the original dot com bubble, we were worshiping at the altar of fiber optic plays like JDS Uniphase and Nortel. And we were buying up stocks like AOL, and Excite, and Lycos and Yahoo. None of which are particularly relevant anymore. But all the predictions, we’re going to buy groceries on the internet. It happens. We’re going to buy pet food on the internet, it happened.

Josh Brown: (14:51)

Toys, books. We’re going to communicate all day long. All of those predictions came true. It’s just the investments weren’t right. So if there is a crypto future and there is a blockchain future, it’s highly possible that the early entrants, who came along in 2015, ’16, ’17, ’18, aren’t going to be a part of it. And a lot of the investments that have been made will turn out to be zeros. But it doesn’t mean that the future is written. So if I could maybe flip the script and this year offer that, I know it’s not that hopeful, but it’s somewhat hopeful to the audience. Then I’ll feel as though I’ve said something that’s somewhat meaningful.

Nolan Bauerle: (15:33)

What you’re basically saying is the world today is recognizable to the entrepreneurs and visionaries of 25 years ago. They would recognize what we’re doing today as the thing they predicted, but as you said, maybe coming at it from a different angle, with different names, on a different platform. The specifics are perhaps different, but the overall outline of it is pretty much in line with what those folks had envisioned.

Josh Brown: (16:00)

You know, this predates what I just talked about. In the 1800s we had a bubble in railroads, and almost every one of them went bankrupt. But what was left behind in the wake of that financial wreckage were the tracks, and the trains, and the stations, and the expertise to build more. And I mean we have trains to this day, and we had bullet trains. And what they’re building to connect … I was just down in Orlando, and I saw all the facilities that they’ve built for the bullet train that’s going to take people from Miami to Orlando in 15 minutes.

Nolan Bauerle: (16:37)

Jeez.

Josh Brown: (16:37)

But that system that they’re building is a descendant of money that was lost to overambitious investment all the way back in the 1840s. So I know people don’t have that much patience to wait 160 years to see their dreams come true, but I’m just pointing out, after the railroad bubble, there were probably a lot of people running around saying, “You see, it’s all stupid.” No, it wasn’t all stupid. And we had functional railroads from the civil war on. So eventually the technology found a way to be profitable, useful, and became woven into the fabric of our society. So it’s possible that the crypto investments people made in 2017 were stupid, but that they had the right idea. And that in the wreckage of the bubble having burst, new companies, new ideas, new entrepreneurs, new uses come about, and the whole thing rebuilds itself.

Josh Brown: (17:34)

And all of a sudden there are people with profitable investments. And just as a Coda to that, I took the long Island railroad into Manhattan today from long Island. And in every car, there are advertisement posters. And in a car I happened to have been riding in today were posters for the Genesis crypto exchange. And I know that’s Tyler and Cameron [Winklevoss] and I would imagine they spent a ton of money on this, but everyone riding that train car was surrounded by posters for this new monetary exchange or brokerage or whatever you want to call it. And most of the people looking at this poster were like, “What the hell does that mean?” But some people know. And I just find it interesting that there were still people willing to invest, and advertise, and market new products. And as long as that continues, maybe there is a future that’s more in the near term than what I think now for these types of technologies.

Nolan Bauerle: (18:32)

So like you’re saying, the tracks were laid to bring you from Miami to the happiest place in the world in such a short amount of time. And perhaps the tracks are still there to bring bitcoin to the moon and realize everyone’s-

Josh Brown: (18:48)

When moon.

Nolan Bauerle: (18:48)

When moon, when moon.

Josh Brown: (18:49)

Well, look, I think we could separate what we think the price of the thing does versus what we think the utility will be. That’s where I’ve been since December of 2018. We wrote a blog post basically saying, I’m done speculating on the price of bitcoin. I think it’s a mania. However, I’m open-minded to the possibility that blockchain will become a transformative technology. The caveat is that it might be very unsexy. It might show up in the income statement of a company that managed to save a few million dollars, by going from database to a blockchain. I don’t know that that implies that the price of a digital coin will go up, but I’m trying to stay open-minded.

Nolan Bauerle: (19:34)

It’s not the romance of pamphleteering around the French Revolution or the American Revolution that everyone was sort of-

Josh Brown: (19:42)

No, right, it could just be corporate cost savings. And again, that is a sort of revolution. It just won’t involve people waving flags and storming the barriers.

Nolan Bauerle: (19:54)

Well, Josh, thanks for your time today.

Josh Brown: (19:56)

Did I bring everybody down? I don’t want to do that.

Nolan Bauerle: (19:59)

No, no. It was fantastic and we’re looking forward to hearing more in just over a week now. So thanks for your time and see you soon.

Josh Brown: (20:07)

All right, Nolan. Thank you.

The correction came after one of the biggest surges in the history of Bitcoin (BTC), which makes the sentiment shift curious. Let’s take a look at the market overview and analyze the charts.

Crypto Market Daily Data View. Source: Coin360

Bitcoin loses 200-Day Moving Average as a key indicator

The recent correction made Bitcoin price lose the 200-Day Moving Average (MA), which is a key indicator for many traders and investors who rely on it to determine bear/bull market cycles.

BTC USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView

Remarkably, the price surged above the 200-Day MA, hovered below the resistance at $9,400-9,600 and retraced back down to the next horizontal support level at $8,600-8,800, which is also the 200-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), another narrative and indicator.

At this level, the price is seemingly finding support, at least for the time being.

However, the 200-Day MA was lost by this correction, causing the sentiment to shift from greed to fear. The reasoning for this comes from historical data, which shows that Bitcoin never dropped below this indicator in recent market cycles (example: 2016 to December 2017).

Key indicators still taking shape

Of course, as the famous saying goes: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The indicators are still forming if this is the beginning of a new bull market cycle. In other words, the price still has to find support on EMAs/MAs, which can then become leading indicators.

Previous examples of comparisons with earlier market cycles didn’t hold up either, which were the 21-Week MA and the maximum correction of 40% that Bitcoin has seen in any bull market (the recent drawdown was 47%).

From that perspective, analyzing the macro view is definitely more helpful instead of drawing comparisons to historical movements, especially on shorter timeframes.

BTC USD 12-hour chart. Source: TradingView

As seen in the chart, the price moved towards important horizontal support and one of the few areas that must hold to sustain a bull market.

The price has been moving in a downward channel since the top in June, which means that the price is bearish in the near-term, though the price of Bitcoin is still up 187% since December 2018.

It is essential that one of these green zones around $8,600-8,800 holds as support. Though a wick towards $8,300 can still occur as a backtest of that support level. Dropping below this mark, on the other hand, would cause the price to lose the trendline and likely result in a new low under $7,300.

But if Bitcoin manages to hold these levels, a support/resistance flip will come into play and a bullish breakout in December may occur. The target to aim for then is $10,800.

Total market capitalization show bottom signals

The total market capitalization still shows bottom signals displaying the first bullish divergence on the daily since the low in December 2018. Moreover, a breakout of the falling wedge also occurred with support confirmation in the green area, which is the $180-200 billion level.

On the other hand, the significant order block around $260 billion is still acting as a heavy resistance, similar to Bitcoin at the $9,600 level.

Lower time frame charts show similar signals as the higher timeframe charts. No clear breakthrough in the red order block and resistance area as the price cleared the smaller resistance zone at $220-225 billion.

While there hasn’t been any backtest of this level yet — there’s a good chance it is now likely to occur. As long as the market is able to hold this important support level at $220-225 billion, resistance could again flip into support and start aiming for higher grounds (potentially breaking $260 billion and aiming for $350 billion).

Altcoin market cap consolidating on higher grounds

The altcoin market capitalization is also becoming interesting as it shows the completion of a 4-month downtrend. This breakout is similar to the movements the market has seen prior to this year when a major downtrend was broken in January as well.

What followed after the breakout? A period of range-bound movements, which can also be seen as accumulation. Similar movements can also be seen here as the market is moving inside a narrow range, suggesting that a big move is in the works.

It is crucial for altcoin market capitalization to hold the $66 billion level as an important marker and support. Losing that level would give space to movements below $50 billion and would delete the trend of higher lows — an essential pattern for a bull market.

If the $66 billion level holds, the target of $90 billion will be key to watch for in the upcoming weeks.

Is Bitcoin dominance ready for a breakdown?

Interestingly enough, while Bitcoin is correcting, Ether (ETH) has been showing strong signals in the ETH/BTC pair. Ether price action is also indicating that Bitcoin dominance is faltering, though it’s still not looking completely bearish yet.

Trendlines have a lower effect on the Bitcoin dominance chart, so for full confirmation of downwards bias, it has to break below 68% dominance. If that occurs, likely targets are then 62-63%.

Crypto winter coming or autumn shakeout?

So is the cryptocurrency market back in a bear market with Bitcoin losing the 200-Day MA?

The simple answer is no.

Macro wise, the market has been moving upwards all year and actually provided a significant return since January. However, some key levels have to hold in order to sustain the macro bullish perspective. In other words, Bitcoin going below $7,300 would be a bearish sign for the entire crypto market.

Holding above $8,300 would renew bullish sentiment and likely create a potential “buy the dip” scenario in which BTC can then make its move towards $11,000 and higher.

On November 15, shortly after 12 p.m., Bitcoin Cash (BCH) will execute an upgrade of the network’s consensus rules. After the upgrade is locked in, the next block will enforce minimal pushdata in script and the opcodes OP_Checkmultisig and OP_Checkmultisigverify will be upgraded to accept Schnorr signatures.

Also Read: QE Infinity: 37 Central Banks Participate in Stimulus and Easing Practices

Delivered Code

Next Friday, Bitcoin Cash proponents will be watching the BCH chain upgrade the current consensus ruleset in order to add two new features. Developers have been discussing the upgrade for months now and have explained in great detail at developer meetings how the changes apply to the BCH roadmap. Since August 1, 2017, BCH developers have produced a significant number of protocol developments that are unique to BCH. For instance, BCH engineers have increased the block size to 32MB, allowing for a lot more throughput than a 1MB block.

In September 2018, BCH surpassed BTC’s daily transaction count by processing millions of transactions in a single day. Bitcoin Cash programmers have re-enabled the old Satoshi opcodes, which can allow for a variety of decision-based transactions, compilers, and other functions. The added opcodes allow for the implementation of OP_Checkdatasig which can be used to calculate the hash within a transaction in order to validate signatures in an automated way. Bitcoin Cash developers also increased the network’s default Data-Carrier-Size to 220 Bytes.

BCH engineers did not stop there and at block 582680, the blockchain upgraded by adding the basic foundations of the Schnorr signature protocol. The upgrade prior to the Schnorr feature saw the implementation of Canonical Transaction Ordering otherwise known as CTOR. With CTOR the BCH chain can essentially work with blocks as a set, as opposed to list ordering as the process is done in a canonical manner. According to Coin Dance statistics, BCH developers have added 20 different components to the protocol, there’s another 20 under development, 15 features being discussed and two new properties pending activation. The two added components being implemented to the BCH blockchain consist of a finalized malleability vector (enforcing minimal pushdata in script) and Schnorr signature support for both OP_Checkmultisig and OP_Checkmultisigverify.

Less than two weeks until the Bitcoin Cash network upgrade! All Bitcoin ABC node operators should ensure they are ready by upgrading to a recent version (0.20.x). https://t.co/MfblcCxh6p#bitcoincash #bch #bitcoin — Bitcoin ABC (@Bitcoin_ABC) November 4, 2019

Two New Ruleset Changes

The first change will curb malleability vectors on the network by applying the Minimaldata rule. “This removes the final BIP 62 malleability vector, and means that most of the transactions on the Bitcoin Cash network (including all P2PKH transactions) will now be non-malleable,” the November 15 upgrade documentation explains. While bitcoin transactions are signed, signatures don’t encompass all the data hashed and it’s possible for nodes to pervert the transaction by invalidating the hash.

There are various forms of malleability vectors in scriptSig and signatures, and in 2014 BIP62 was introduced in order to deal with the problems. Over the last few years, many types of solutions have been attempted in order to confront third-party malleability vectors. After the network upgrade next Friday, a majority of bitcoin cash transactions will not be third-party malleable and the enforced Minimaldata rule should also strengthen Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients.

The second added feature coming to the BCH chain is support for OP_Checkmultisig (Verify) in order to complement the first iteration of Schnorr signatures. “This upgrade extends that support to OP_Checkmultisig and after this upgrade, all signature checking operations will support Schnorr signatures,” the upgrade documentation reads.

The new feature will allow for more complex mechanics to multi-signature transactions that will benefit from the Schnorr mechanism. “Schnorr aggregated signatures (with OP_Checksig) are one way to do multi-signatures, but they have different technical properties than the familiar Bitcoin multisig, and thus are far from being a drop-in replacement for it,” the November 15 specification notes. The summary adds:

Besides that, it is also desirable that any existing coin can be spent using Schnorr signatures, and there are numerous OP_Checkmultisig-based wallets and coins in existence that we want to be able to take advantage of Schnorr signatures.

Upgrading Nodes and Where to Watch

Bitcoin Cash fans are excited about the next upgrade and network participants have been steadily preparing for the changes. Ordinary users won’t have to do anything before the network changes take effect. Miners and node operators, however, are encouraged to download and run the latest version of a BCH client that supports the November 15 ruleset changes.

Currently Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BCHD, Flowee, and Bitcoin Verde are all ready to accept the new rules, and at press time 68% of all publicly accessible BCH nodes show upgrade support. Every day enthusiasts and proponents who don’t mine or run a node can simply watch the upgrade online using a data site like Coin Dance or Fork Monitor. On November 15, both websites will let people know exactly when the consensus changes are executed.

For more information regarding the November 15 Bitcoin Cash upgrade, you can read the specifications on Github.

Digital lira to be internalized next year

The Presidential Program published by Turkey’s official national publication Resmi Gazete on Nov. 4 established that the government should complete the test phase of the nation’s CBDC by the end of 2020.

The government plans to develop a platform capable of instant payments employing the currency. Both the country’s central bank and the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey work on developing the new system.

Fraudster rakes in 600 BTC

A scammer Aydin, Turkey, defrauded up to 40 people of roughly 600 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at over $5 million at press time. The victims — among them doctors and police officers — were reportedly lured with the promise of high dividends on their investments.

The fraudster also used a referral system promising to victims bringing new investors profit shares up to 15%-20%. Twenty victims have been gained with this method.

Turkish football club launches a token

Turkish Football Club Galatasaray Spor Kulübü launched Ethereum-based fan tokens in a partnership with blockchain sports fan startup Socios based on sports tokenization platform Chiliz. According to a press release, 10 million tokens worth 10 Turkish liras ($0.17) each have been minted for a total value of $17.3 million.

The team’s tokens will reportedly let fans express their opinion and direct the club’s operation to the degree allowed by its management. All the interactions will be carried out through an official iOS and Android mobile application.

Huobi and Binance are coming to Turkey

Cointelegraph Turkey recently interviewed two executives of the crypto exchange Huobi after the company’s recently announced plans to launch a fiat gateway for the Turkish lira. During the interview, Huobi MENA co-founder Mohit Davar and Chief of Staff at Huobi Ciara Sun answered questions concerning the exchange’s move to Turkey.

Davar said that the firm had already opened an office in the country with a dedicated four-person team and plans to double the number of local employees by the end of the year. Furthermore, Sun pointed out that not only the exchange, but also Huobi Pool, Huobi Wallet, Huobi Capital and Huobi Labs will also all be at the service of the Turkish crypto community.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, the strategy officer of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Gin Chao, announced that Binance’s move to Turkey is also imminent. He said that Turkey carries market characteristics favorable for cryptocurrency adoption.

More precisely, he explained that Turkey has a notable gross domestic product but lacks the political and financial stability of the eurozone, making the country a prime candidate as a place to use cryptocurrency in everyday life.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/her-majesty-the-queen-rules-out-crypto-as-currency,"Only a few weeks after the United States Internal Revenue Service published new guidance for crypto taxation, the United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, has updated its cryptocurrency taxation policy paper for businesses and individuals.

The HMRC's approach in this policy paper is, as expected, conservative, and it stands in line with other countries’ tax treatment for cryptocurrencies. The HMRC explicitly states that it does not consider crypto as a currency, and the policy paper uses the term ""cryptoassets"" and not cryptocurrency.

The policy paper on individuals considers crypto activity as a personal investment subject to capital gains tax that should be paid when crypto is sold for fiat, using crypto to pay for goods or services, gifting crypto or — unlike the position of the French tax authority — exchanging crypto for crypto.

Capital gains tax is commonly used to tax crypto activity in many countries, such as the U.S. and Israel. However, while other countries are struggling to draw the line between personal activity and professional trading, the HMRC states that crypto would fall into the definition of business activity ""only in exceptional circumstances,” continuing:

“HMRC expects individuals to buy and sell cryptoassests with such frequency, level of organization and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade in itself.”

The policy paper states that an employee’s salary and mining activity are subject to income tax.

Mining activity by individuals can also be classified as a business activity. The HMRC will review several factors to decide on the classification, such as degree of activity, organization, risk and commerciality.

If the mining activity does not amount to a trade, any crypto awarded for successful mining — or any other mining fee — will be taxable as income. If it falls under the classification of business activity, then corporate tax and a value-added tax may be due. In cases where the individual did not sell immediately and was awarded crypto, they will be subject to capital gains tax when that crypto is sold or exchanged.

Airdrops can be treated as capital gains or as income tax, depending on the circumstances. If the airdrops are being given in the event of a chain split or in any other case that does not constitute a payment for providing a service or business activity, it will be treated as capital gains tax. If it is related to any service or other conditions, it will be taxed as income.

If you are paying income tax on crypto activities, you may also offset your losses from trades against future profits or other income.

It seems as if someone in the HMRC understands the tax ramifications of the volatile crypto market. The policy paper attempts to prevent crypto trades that use the volatile market to manipulate the taxes due. The paper has a specific rule for crypto acquired within 30 days of selling. This rule will apply if an individual acquires tokens and sells or exchanges them within 30 days of the disposal of the same token type. Those who will buy and sell the same tokens will not be subjected to capital loss up to the amount of the new tokens purchase on those dates.

The HMRC’s conservative approach also applies to business activity. Crypto companies will not find crypto-friendly tax benefits under Her Majesty’s policy.

U.K.-based crypto companies are subject to corporation tax on their profits and gains. Any goods or services sold in exchange for crypto tokens are subject to VAT.

With that being said, the HMRC decided that under the Value Added Tax Act 1994, financial services supplied by crypto exchanges or any services required to exchange tokens are exempt from VAT.

Companies paying salaries in crypto are subject to income tax and national insurance contributions on the value of the asset.

The U.K.’s “stamp duty reserve tax” is charged on stocks and securities. The HMRC does not consider crypto as a stock or security, and therefore, there will be no stamp duty reserve tax on crypto business activity in the U.K.

Without a doubt, 2019 will be marked as the year of crypto tax guidance. After 11 years of Bitcoin’s existence, countries around the world are creating clarity for taxpayers regarding crypto activity. Will 2020 be the year that finally shows a significant increase in tax filings? Only time will tell.

The charismatic 36-year-old told the crowd that it was not too late to join a financial revolution that would become bigger than Bitcoin within just a couple of years

With flames leaping from the stage, ear-splitting music pumping from loudspeakers and a screaming crowd, the sell-out event at London’s Wembley Arena seemed more like a rock concert than a financial sales conference.

But as Alicia Key’s Girl On Fire began to fade, an electrified silence swept across the auditorium and Dr Ruja Ignatova took to the stage dressed in a flowing silk ballgown, and with bright red lipstick and spectacular diamond drop earrings.

Then, with thousands of eyes locked on her, the glamorous German-Bulgarian began to spell out an extraordinary vision.

The future, she said, belonged to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which had made millions for some small investors and were free of rules, regulations and the costly fees of traditional banks.

True, Bitcoin was complex and cumbersome for ordinary people.

But Dr Ruja, as she styled herself, was offering a radical new alternative that warm June evening in 2016 – a perfectly safe cryptocurrency of her own devising called OneCoin.

The charismatic 36-year-old told the crowd that it was not too late to join a financial revolution that would become bigger than Bitcoin within just a couple of years.

She urged them to invest. And the audience lapped it up, as they did at similar events in Dubai, Macau and Singapore. OneCoin promoters were hard at work in seminars and computer chatrooms around the world, in fact, and the reward was spectacular.

By March 2017, more than £3.5 billion had been invested in the OneCoin system from 175 countries. It is thought around £100 million of that came from the UK.

Yet within just a few months, the mysterious Bulgarian would be a fugitive from the FBI, accused of conducting one of the biggest individual frauds in financial history.

Today, her victims number more than a million, many facing financial ruin. Dr Ruja, meanwhile, has vanished.

As the sheer scale of the fraud became apparent, I set out to find Dr Ruja, starting at her £2 million mansion in Bulgaria’s seaside resort of Sozopol. Her impressive yacht (above) was moored in a nearby harbour, but the staff said they hadn’t seen her since 2017

Just as promised, OneCoin was simple to understand. Investors could sign up to buy the currency which would then appear in their account.

Because more and more people would join, said Dr Ruja, the value of the currency would go up and, sure enough, early investors soon saw the value of their holdings rise.

One day very soon, these coins could be traded for real money, they were assured. And before long, shops and restaurants would accept OneCoin as payment too.

Supporters described Dr Ruja as the next Mark Zuckerberg. She was said to have an IQ of more than 200.

The Bulgarian was pictured on the cover of Forbes magazine, which specialises in wealthy individuals.

Social media was awash with pictures and clips of Dr Ruja, including a dazzling performance at a European conference organised by The Economist.

Blessed with a magnetic personality and good looks, she wielded a cult-like influence, according to disillusioned former followers.

Investors developed their own hand-sign – making an ‘O’ with the thumb and index finger – and referred to each other as ‘family’.

There was a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr Ruja in the company’s office, which adoring staff used to touch as a ritual before making the OneCoin sign –until it eventually fell to pieces.

With interest rates at rock-bottom levels, the appeal of cryptocurrencies and the rapid gains they were making seemed obvious to ordinary savers. Where else could they put their money?

Early doubts were expressed about OneCoin in Finland, Sweden and Belgium, where the authorities issued investor warnings. Readers of specialist financial websites were told that OneCoin bore the hallmarks of a pyramid-selling scheme.

Social media was awash with pictures and clips of Dr Ruja, including a dazzling performance at a European conference organised by The Economist. Blessed with a magnetic personality and good looks, she wielded a cult-like influence, according to disillusioned former followers

But such criticism did nothing to stop the money pouring in. Dr Ruja’s supporters dismissed the sceptics as ‘haters’, either afraid of the revolution or unable to comprehend it.

After all, what was there to doubt? OneCoin was going from strength to strength. There was still no sign of being able to sell OneCoin for dollars or pounds, but money was being made.

In 2016, when Dr Ruja spoke in London, plenty of people were making sizeable cash commissions by selling OneCoin to friends and family.

And how could Dr Ruja be anything other than trustworthy? She obtained a law degree from Oxford, followed by a stint working for McKinsey & Company, the respected global asset management firm.

The Bulgarian herself was reassuringly rich, throwing expensive parties on her luxury yacht moored in the Black Sea. She based herself in a rented penthouse in London’s Kensington, where she celebrated her 36th birthday.

A video posted on YouTube shows guests enjoying pink champagne, vodka and sushi at the V&A museum, where hundreds of revellers, all in ballgowns or black tie, danced to a live performance by Tom Jones.

By the autumn of 2017, the self-styled ‘cryptoqueen’ seemed unstoppable. But in October, she failed to appear at a OneCoin event in Portugal.

Frantic phone calls, emails and messages went unanswered. No one had heard anything at OneCoin’s head office in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.

And it was then, for the first time, that most of Dr Ruja’s millions of victims began to realise something was seriously wrong.

Dr Ruja’s scam, it turns out, was surprisingly simple. And as I started to investigate how ordinary savers were sucked in, I came across Jen McAdam, 48, from Glasgow, who had invested £900 in the cryptocurrency after seeing a presentation online.

Like many OneCoin investors, she didn’t really understand the technology but was blown away by the amazing returns on offer and, most of all, by the impressive leader.

She signed up and was sent an activation code, giving her access to a website where she could check the value of her OneCoins.

Very quickly, she could see her portfolio rise. As far as she was concerned, it seemed like easy money.

Impressed, she invested her £8,600 inheritance – her coal miner father’s life savings – into the scheme. And she encouraged friends and family to join.

Some people who have had their fingers burned by OneCoin are beginning to talk. Various sources say Dr Ruja has sought refuge in Dubai, Russia, Brazil and even London. There are rumours that she might be getting help from higher powers – organised crime, perhaps, or even the Kremlin

Fairly soon, £200,000 had been invested by her Glasgow-based network. Tearfully, she told me that ‘it spread like wildfire’.

After just a few months, Jen believed her original stake was worth nearly £100,000. But she would soon be disabused of that notion.

One evening, she received a disturbing call from Timothy Curry, a Bitcoin enthusiast from California, who was trying to warn investors that OneCoin was a scam and that their money was gone. She didn’t believe him at first.

But Curry explained the basic principle that all cryptocurrencies have a special type of database called a blockchain – an incorruptible computer record of all transactions that proves to everybody that the currency is sound.

This technology makes it impossible to counterfeit new currency and guarantees there is a finite number in circulation.

Without the security of the blockchain and the fiendish mathematics behind it, the price could be rigged or faked. Whole fortunes could be created and then deleted at the push of a button.

Jen started asking to see evidence of OneCoin’s blockchain, but the company’s officials refused, saying it was secret.

After speaking to a blockchain specialist, she came to the horrifying realisation that the daily valuation of her investment on her computer screen did not reflect any true value at all. It was just a made-up price created in Bulgaria.

OneCoin wasn’t part of the cryptocurrency revolution. It was an old-fashioned confidence trick dressed up in high-tech clothing.

The disaster has taken on global proportions. Because OneCoin was sold through network marketing, people like Jen brought in friends and family.

Farmers in Uganda invested a small fortune hoping it would transform their lives. A disproportionate number of British Muslims are among the victims.

Forbidden by sharia law from many standard forms of financial investments –because of the prohibition on earning interest – OneCoin seemed ideal and it seems they were targeted.

So how was Dr Ruja able to convince people across the globe to invest in a such a scam?

Eileen Barker, professor emeritus of sociology at the London School of Economics, believes the OneCoin organisation had similarities to messianic movements or cults in which people are led to believe they are part of something so big it is going to change the world.

The regulators, moreover, were feeble. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority issued a warning about OneCoin in September 2016, but removed it in August 2017 with little explanation. The FCA now faces serious questions.

OneCoin promoters took this as evidence nothing was wrong and carried on recruiting.

Shockingly, people are still selling OneCoin in Britain today and still sharing that Forbes ‘cover’ picture on social media. (It was, in fact, nothing more than a paid advertisement in a Bulgarian edition of the magazine.)

Private emails released in a bundle of US court documents suggest Dr Ruja had an exit strategy planned soon after the company was set up: ‘Take the money and run, and blame someone else…’ she wrote.

But the documents suggest that at other moments she acknowledged the gravity of her actions, writing to one colleague: ‘The damage is done. I have to somehow live with it. But it is something that really upsets me.’ Not that this will be much comfort for the victims she has left behind.

In March this year, Dr Ruja’s younger brother Konstantin Ignatov, who took over OneCoin when Ruja vanished, was arrested by the FBI as he boarded a plane from Los Angeles to Turkey.

He was charged with fraud, and Dr Ruja was charged in absentia with wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy to commit money-laundering.

Today, Dr Ruja is wanted by the FBI. One of New York’s top prosecutors, the District Attorney for Manhattan, has described OneCoin as ‘a pyramid scheme based on smoke and mirrors’.

And like all pyramid schemes, it’s only the people at the top who get very rich.

While most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are perfectly legitimate enterprises, Dr Ruja found she could exploit the hype surrounding new technology, the lack of effective regulation – and plain, old-fashioned ignorance.

The FCA says British citizens have lost millions in crypto scams, mostly in speculative new projects they didn’t understand.

As the sheer scale of the fraud became apparent, I set out to find Dr Ruja, starting at her £2 million mansion in Bulgaria’s seaside resort of Sozopol. Her impressive yacht was moored in a nearby harbour, but the staff said they hadn’t seen her since 2017.

I found parts of her multi-million-pound property empire in Sofia: the city’s most famous restaurant – now boarded up – and an imposing building overlooking Bulgaria’s parliament. But of Dr Ruja herself, I found nothing.

And what about the missing fortune? The Mail on Sunday understands that a proportion of the £3.5 billion she accumulated is managed by a UK family wealth office in London, but so far our questions have gone unanswered.

Meanwhile, a US lawyer is currently on trial in New York accused of laundering OneCoin proceeds.

I was startled to find the OneCoin headquarters operating as normal in Sofia. OneCoin insists the US authorities are wrong, that it is a legitimate cryptocurrency and that everything will come good in the end. The company was unable to help me find its founder.

Some people who have had their fingers burned by OneCoin are beginning to talk.

Various sources say Dr Ruja has sought refuge in Dubai, Russia, Brazil and even London.

There are rumours that she might be getting help from higher powers – organised crime, perhaps, or even the Kremlin.

Some say she is living on a yacht and travelling around the Mediterranean with a fake passport and that her appearance has been altered with cosmetic surgery. Others are convinced she is dead.

Then, two weeks ago, I got another lead. Could she be in Germany, where Dr Ruja’s family emigrated when she was ten years old?

Hours of research on the internet, cross-referencing the movements of her friends and associates, suggested that the most likely hiding place is Frankfurt.

It might seem a gamble to hide from the FBI in Germany’s financial capital, but Dr Ruja is a woman used to taking risks.

And with access to so much money, she could have multiple identities, addresses and a regularly changing appearance – as disturbingly intangible as the so-called currency through which she has stolen billions from ordinary, hard-working people.

Jamie Bartlett’s eight-part podcast, The Missing Cryptoqueen, is available on BBC Sounds.",2019-11-09 22:02:48+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/for-initial-exchange-offerings-liquidity-is-king/,"For Initial Exchange Offerings, Liquidity is King

There are many benchmarks for measuring IEO success. Token price, community size, code shipped, and milestones met are all yardsticks for gauging the progress of a tokenized project. For projects seeking to create the biggest possible splash, however, liquidity is the crucial factor. The more exchanges an IEO reaches, the greater its prospects of survival.

Also read: How Crypto Winters of Bitcoin’s Past Compare to Today

Multiple Exchanges Multiply Projects’ Prospects

Initial exchange offerings are big business: according to Inwara, IEO projects raised a cool $1.625 billion in the first half of 2019. H2 has continued that trend, with the leading exchange launchpads maintaining their aggressive IEO schedule – one a month in the case of Binance; 24/7 in the case of smaller platforms such as Latoken. Investor demand for initial exchange offerings also remains robust: the leading crypto Telegram channels, maintained by the likes of Coinidol, attest to this, as investors clamor to catch wind of pre-sale and seed rounds for projects that will eventually IEO on Binance or Huobi.

While the initial exchange offering brings benefits to investors and project teams, compared to the ICO, it is hamstrung by a flaw that is inherent to this fundraising model: often, there is little incentive for other exchanges to list the token. As a result, most IEOs will live and die on the exchange that hosted their token sale. For the handful of IEOs that have thrived post-sale, both in terms of token price and other benchmarks, it’s no coincidence that they’ve transcended their issuing platform, and gained deep liquidity in the process.

Bittorrent Remains the Liquid Leader

The most liquid token IEO to date, based on the number of exchanges where it’s listed, is also one of the earliest: Bittorrent (BTT), which launched on Binance last year. Today it appears on 34 exchanges – 24 more than the next most-listed tokens. It’s no coincidence that tokens listed on the most exchanges – namely BTT (34), MATIC (10) and SERO (10) – outperform all others as far as ROI and ATH ROI are concerned. The correlation between number of exchanges and project performance is inarguable.

For better or worse, IEOs have taken the crypto world by storm, but most projects will never see the sort of liquidity enjoyed by Bittorrent and Matic. In fact, of the 65 IEOs launched in the past six months, the vast majority have failed to even make it onto a second exchange. The consequence of this has been limited liquidity, low accessibility/visibility and, in many cases, a project which has effectively died before it has even gotten the opportunity to develop any serious momentum.

A final note on IEO liquidity: when it comes to securing multiple exchange listings, quality beats quantity every time. According to Cryptorank.io, Binance leads the way, with a much higher average ROI for its listed tokens (94.53%). Bittorrent’s runaway success played a part in this: it was the first IEO on Binance Launchpad, meeting its funding goal of $7.2 million in mere minutes. Every project since has struggled in vain to emulate that success.

Do you think IEOs have peaked, or are they just getting started? Let us know in the comments section below.

The American tax agency just revealed that it has properly identified “dozens” of potential criminals that are using things like Bitcoin to purportedly perpetrate (and perpetuate) their crimes.

Bloomberg reported that there was a meeting held between officials from the U.S., U.K., Canada, and the Netherlands — a tax-officiating group known as the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement. At the meeting, the entities shared “data, tools and tax enforcement strategies” in a bid to find those trying to participate in ” mitigate cross-border money-laundering, tax evasion, and cybercrime.” On the matter of why they’re focusing on digital technologies, specifically crypto assets, the Joint Chiefs wrote:

“Data breaches, intrusions, takeovers and compromises are the new tools that criminals use to commit tax crimes.”

This news comes amid a clear concerted effort from the IRS and other tax agencies to curb the use of cryptocurrency, presumably including assets from Bitcoin to Monero, in criminal activity.

Last month, the IRS began to circulate a draft of the new Form 1040, Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. The draft has the following question right at the top:

“At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

Just before that, the IRS revealed its latest guidance on cryptocurrency taxes — the first guidance of its kind in some five years. The guidance addressed cryptocurrency forks, along with the acceptable methods of evaluating digital assets received as income, and how to calculate taxable gains.

Crypto Crackdown

Part of this crackdown is affecting exchanges too.

Speaking to an audience at a fintech event at the Georgetown University Law Center, Director of the U.S. Treasury branch of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Kenneth Blanco said that cryptocurrency firms are not above AML laws.

Firms dealing with digital assets, he remarked, are still subject to the Bank Secrecy Act, “whether you are a stablecoin, centralized, decentralized crypto.” He asserted that this has to be the case due to the potential that individuals on the other side of cryptocurrency transactions might be “dealing in some kind of illicit activity,” be it “opioids or human smuggling.”

Tezos rallied on news from major exchanges, an analyst discussed why DOGE is doing better than most altcoins, and a report said that a single whale manipulated 2017 Bitcoin rally, though multiple industry players dismissed it. Roger Ver says Bitcoin Cash may be worth 99,900% more, Stellar price skyrocketed following the burn, and while Ripple's customer base went up 50%, the CEO believes there are too many cryptos and that a bull’s coming for the market, but XRP dropped among worst performers.

And as that was happening, Trezor denied links to Venezuela, the British government presented new crypto tax rulings; the EU finance ministers might discuss a new draft that advocates a common approach to cryptos; Russia’s crypto law took a confusing turn, but it might stop legal trading in BTC, ETH and other altcoins; China changed its opinion on BTC mining; and Hong Kong published a framework for crypto exchanges. In the meantime, North Korea is turning young talent into elite crypto hackers.

Among a number of exchange news, we learned that BitMEX found malicious groups trying to collect email addresses, DX.Exchange closed temporarily while waiting for a merger or sale, Bittrex and FTX are each facing a lawsuit, and users of Einstein Exchange and ezBtc.ca can’t access their funds. We’ve also learned why crypto business rushes to Turkey, that a law megafirm accepted its first crypto payment, and that there are blockchain-powered kettles and hairdryers.

And now, the jokes. Enjoy!

“This is a one-of-a-kind property and offering the option to buy in bitcoin opens up to international audiience. When a buyer uses bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, the transfer of funds is much faster than the traditional banking system and less expensive.”

He added that the property has already seen some potential buyers swing by, who claim to want to pay using BTC.

While this sale may seem like a far-fetched plan, there is evidence of homes actually selling for cryptocurrencies.

As reported by this outlet earlier this year in April, a glamorous modern home down under was sold for a jaw-dropping 457 BTC, which amounted to $2.4 million at Bitcoin’s then current valuation. To put 457 BTC into perspective, here are some numbers:

Highest bid on the house is in #BNB. auction is live. #UseBNB 🔥🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/Pfu9oBOgb9 — CZ Binance (@cz_binance) April 8, 2019

457 is the number of BTC mined in 36.5 blocks, which take approximately six hours to process. 457 is approximately 0.002100% of the entire supply of Bitcoin that will ever be mined. Long story short, 457 BTC is quite a hefty sum, that’s for sure.

Don’t Want to be the “Bitcoin Pizza Guy”

That led me, personally, to the following question: Could the owner of the Australian house and Bitcoin users that participate in other high-ticket purchases with cryptocurrency become the next Laszlo, a BitcoinTalk user who purchased two purportedly Papa John’s pizzas for 10,000 BTC?

The answer: no, likely not. But “baller” crypto investors might be missing out on a large amount of upside if they decide to spend their coins.

PlanB’s stock-to-flow scarcity model for Bitcoin, which uses the cryptocurrency’s stock-to-flow ratio (effectively the inflation rate) and relates it to BTC’s market capitalization, predicts massive appreciation in the future. The linear regression model, which produces a 95% R2 (statistic lingo for extremely accurate), predicts that BTC’s fair value will reach somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000 after May 2020’s halving event.

Stock-to-flow model has a lot of proponents, but not everybody is a fan. For a balanced view here are some of the most well known people against S2F:https://t.co/p2cLe7uGIDhttps://t.co/WlYSChAfVthttps://t.co/TzRLfxRZ9E

Of course, there’s a chance that Bitcoin could begin to lose steam, and start to decouple from this model. But bulls aren’t expecting that to happen… obviously.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.

Top Stories This Week

We begin in Russia, where the government is pursuing a seemingly impossible law that would allow it to confiscate Bitcoin (BTC). Reports suggest that the plans, which target “digital assets,” could become law in 2021. Nikita Kulikov, the head of a dedicated committee to the matter in Russia’s parliament, said such mechanisms are necessary because of “the constant growth trend in crimes using virtual assets, and the lack of consumer protection in the face of this kind of criminal onslaught.” The country’s laws regarding cryptocurrency have been long-awaited but subject to multiple delays. For this law to work, it seems that crypto would require legal recognition in order for the government to justify its confiscation as part of legal proceedings. But there are bigger hurdles Moscow may face. First off, would exchanges comply with any order to hand over crypto? And second, how would the authorities manage to confiscate coins protected by a private key only the cybercriminal knows?

A big announcement was made during Hong Kong Fintech Week, with the territory’s monetary authority confirming it is conducting research into applications for a central bank digital currency. It has also emerged that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has signed a blockchain collaboration with the People’s Bank of China, which is touted as the first economy that will achieve such a milestone. It seems the HKMA is particularly interested in how a CBDC could benefit financial institutions — namely when it comes to domestic interbank payments and wholesale corporate payments. Less of an emphasis is being placed on retail use given how consumers already have widespread access to mobile payment services.

Chinese authorities have confirmed in new official documents that BTC mining is not going to face a state crackdown. Previously, the practice had been listed as one of the government’s targets. It’s a rare boon for BTC-related activities in China, a country where cryptocurrency outside of the central bank’s control remains all but banned. Last month, BTC/USD prices soared when President Xi Jinping called for the adoption of blockchain technologies to be accelerated across the country. The latest announcement appeared to have little impact on the crypto markets, but it’s good news for the likes of Chinese mining giant Canaan Creative, which recently unveiled plans for a $400 million IPO.

The head of Facebook’s Calibra platform has doubled down on claims that personal data from the social network will never entwine with financial data from its crypto wallet. To this end, David Marcus has revealed that Calibra is exploring whether it will be possible for third parties to verify this is the case. Fellow executive Kevin Weil has also been speaking out this week, and said Libra will be more comparable to email technology than payment services such as PayPal. All this came as the European Union warned “all options should be on the table” when it comes to Libra — with member states warning they could block the project from launching if it is deemed to present “unmanageable or excessive risks.” And, in other developments, a draft document issued by the EU has suggested that the union should consider issuing its own digital currency.

Coca-Cola’s bottlers are implementing blockchain technology to manage their cross-party transactions, it emerged this week. The tech firm that manages IT operations is using a blockchain solution to make the supply chain run smoother. Multiple franchises manufacture, bottle and ship a whopping 160,000 orders of Coca-Cola products on a daily basis. Andrei Semenov, a senior manager at Coke One North America, said the technology was helping to speed up transactions and save money — with the duration of order-reconciliation being slashed from 50 days to just a few days.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $9,064, Ether at $190 and XRP at $0.28. The total market cap is at $242,661,465,318.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are CyberFM, TravelNote and MarteXcoin. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Abulaba, ParallelCoin and Grimcoin.

These things are protocols, and as long as you build to the protocol everything’s interoperable. Libra is the same way.” Kevin Weil, vice president of product at Facebook's Calibra

Prediction of the Week

We love a good prediction at Hodler’s Digest. This week, Roger Ver said he was planning to give $5 in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to each of his Facebook friends — all with a view to catalyzing the adoption of the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. He said that humble $5 “could easily be worth $5,000 some day” — an increase of 99,900%. Those who aren’t part of Ver’s inner circle on Facebook are being given the chance to receive $1 in BCH. Hundreds of people have since commented with their wallet addresses, hoping to get a slice of the action. BCH’s price stood at $287 at the time of this writing, meaning the coin would need to soar to an eye-watering $287,000 for his prediction to be realized.

Introduction of the Week

Meet the new executive editor of Cointelegraph! His name is Jay Cassano, and his appointment marks a return to blockchain journalism. Here’s what he has to say: “We’re at a unique moment when blockchain’s Wild West is bumping up against its wider adoption by mainstream society. From Facebook to the Chinese government, powerful interests are getting involved in this technology. And at the same time, bad actors operating in a largely unregulated space still try to take advantage of unsuspecting enthusiasts. These developments make the role of independent media covering the space all the more critical.”

FUD of the Week

After winning $500,000 in the state lottery, an Illinois resident didn’t hesitate in deciding how he was going to spend his winnings. He put half of his cash haul immediately into BTC — all with a plan of hodling for a year. After taxes, he would have invested a total of $178,500 in BTC — and it seems to have been a strategy that has paid off handsomely. He acquired his BTC back in May, and since then, prices have risen by more than 63%, increasing his winnings substantially. Responding to his post, Reddit contributors said there were only two things he appears to have done wrong: first, failing to invest 100% of his windfall into BTC; and second, publicizing his story and making himself a potential target for criminals.

There have been some confusing scenes in Venezuela this week, where President Nicolas Maduro appeared on state-run television holding a crypto hardware storage device that was allegedly developed by Trezor, a major wallet supplier. He was flanked by people who claimed to be from a business called Trezorvenezuela. The company initially denied having any association with the country — insisting it doesn’t have resellers based there — and vowed to launch an investigation. It has since emerged that Trezorvenezuela was briefly an authorized reseller before its status was rescinded because of inactivity.

Bitfinex abruptly canceled its token sale for K.im, Kim Dotcom’s BTC content sharing service, this week. In a blog post, executives said they had agreed not to proceed with initial exchange offering, which had a planned fundraising goal of $8 million. In a statement, Bitfinex said “the regulatory environment has rapidly evolved” since the project was announced, which clarified the risks associated with raising funds.

Getting into the Bitcoin world is by default easy and it doesn’t have to cost you anything. All you need to do to get started is to install a cryptocurrency wallet and load it with some digital cash. The growing crypto community, always enthusiastic about accepting new members, has done a lot to make sure you can take these first steps at no expense.

Get a Free Crypto Wallet First

To start with Bitcoin you don’t need to be ultra tech savvy but having a basic idea of how cryptocurrency works and what it brings to the world is not a bad idea. There’s a ton of information out there and simple guides such as those prepared by Bitcoin.com will quickly convince you that no matter who you are, Bitcoin is for you. Learning how to buy and sell, send and receive, exchange and protect your cryptos takes little effort and is fun.

What you really need to begin your endeavor into discovering financial freedom is a digital wallet that supports your favorite cryptocurrency. Luckily, there are plenty of free clients available and as long as you find one with good reputation in terms of security, you are all set. For example, you can download and install the Bitcon.com wallet app free of charge and manage your bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) holdings in one wallet. Almost 5 million Bitcoin.com wallets have been created so far.

There are different types of wallets you can use. In general, hardware devices such as Ledger and Keepkey provide safer storage for your digital coins. But the utility of software wallets can’t be denied and they are always a good choice for newbies. Software is usually created for more than one operating system. The Bitcoin.com wallet is available as a mobile application for both Android and iOS. And if you are looking for a desktop app, the Badger Wallet is a good option. You can add it to your browser if you are using Chrome or Firefox.

When setting up a bitcoin wallet, it’s important to follow the instructions of the client’s developers. During the installation process you’ll be asked to write down a mnemonic seed phrase that will help you to restore access to your funds in case something irreversible or irreparable happens to the device you installed it on initially. It’s also smart to set up a pin code to authorize any outgoing transactions. Make sure you record and keep that as well.

Load Your Wallet With Free Coins

Once you’ve installed your wallet you’ll have to load it to start transacting in cryptocurrency. And while there are many options to buy some, acquire it on an exchange or purchase it directly from other bitcoin holders, you can also get it for free. The Bitcoin.com faucet provides you with one such option. All you need to do to receive some bitcoin cash (BCH) is to take three easy steps. First, you have to download and install the Bitcoin.com or the Badger wallet. Then you need to log in with your Google account and finally enter your BCH address to claim your free electronic cash.

Another opportunity to receive some cryptocurrency is through a friendly gesture. Many in the crypto community are excited about spreading adoption and if you look around you’ll probably find a friend who will be happy to send you some satoshis just to get you started. Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver recently announced on Facebook he is giving away $5 worth of BCH to any of his friends in the social network who provides a bitcoin cash address.

If you want to hodl your coins, crypto history has shown that $5 of bitcoin can easily become $5,000 in the future. But there are also many things you could do with them right now. For instance, you can send some satoshis to a friend who wants to try crypto. Thanks to the low fees on the BCH network, often less than a U.S. cent per transaction, that will be easy and cheap even with a very small amount. You can also donate some of the bitcoin cash you got for a noble cause like the one supported by the eat BCH charity.

And as crypto commerce is growing once again this year, you can spend your electronic cash in a variety of other ways. The Bitcoin Cash Map app now lists almost 1,800 brick and mortar stores that will let you pay with BCH. Spending bitcoin with retailers that do not directly accept cryptocurrency is another option thanks to gift cards you can purchase with BCH and BTC. Getting a $5 Dunkin’ Donuts card takes just a few easy steps.

A new crypto resource has emerged in Barquisimeto, Venezuela, for Venezuelans interested in learning about Bitcoin Cash and cryptocurrencies. The project, called Bitcoin Cash House, is the brainchild of Roberto Garcia and is sponsored by Bitcoin.com and Sideshift.ai. It exists as a physical location and online initiative, seeking to educate newcomers to the space on the acquisition, storage, and general use of crypto, as well as development and job opportunities.

Welcome to the Cash House

Launched just days ago, on November 7, Bitcoin Cash House teaches people in Venezuela about the benefits of crypto. With the nation in a state of economic upheaval and political unrest, many Venezuelans are understandably concerned about finding ways to transact, send and earn money that are not dependent on the hyper-inflated bolivar or the whims of a volatile government.

A Reddit post detailing the launch by Bitcoin.com’s Matt Aaron describes Bitcoin Cash House as “A crypto education hub in the city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. A mall kiosk where local cryptocurrency advocates teach Venezuelans about the power of cryptocurrency.”

Some of the topics the Cash House will educate folks on include “How to send money to friends and family anywhere in the world instantly,” advantages of crypto over traditional money, how to store and spend crypto, “How to protect assets against volatility with SLP tokens including the USDH stablecoin,” and jobs in crypto as well as developer opportunities.

Though the launch was a challenging process, the crypto advocates involved saw it through. Aaron, host of the Humans of Bitcoin podcast, explains that “We at Bitcoin.com and Sideshift.ai did the easy part and got the sponsorship money. Roberto Garcia did all the hard stuff. It’s his project. He scoured the city to find a place … 2 months later and it’s live. Roberto went to just about every mall; shopping center. Rejections, delays, stipulations.” Founder Garcia notes in the comments:

In Venezuela there is a lot of fear, but thanks to my experience and knowledge with the help of Matt we managed to overcome the problems.

Moving Forward in Venezuela

Garcia, who also organizes a BCH meetup in Barquisimeto, understands the importance of a physical location and human conversation for conveying the power of crypto. Citing the Los Angeles area hub for “education and services needed to encourage the adoption of digital currencies,” Cryptospace, Matt Aaron writes in the Reddit post:

Having a physical location is POWERFUL. We the cryptocommunity, talk ‘trustless’. But the rest of the world has to earn that trust. In person conversations are powerful.

The Bitcoin Cash House project is currently an experiment, operating on a three-month lease and seeing where things go from there. Aaron notes that surrounding businesses will be encouraged to adopt BCH as well, stating “In the same location are a pizzeria, bank, and liquor store. We will teach them to start accepting Bitcoin Cash as well.” Donations to Bitcoin Cash House can be made via venezuela.Bitcoin.com, and a Spanish language announcement of the launch can be found here.

This time, the European Central Bank’s former president Jean-Claude Trichet has cast doubt on cryptocurrencies, bashing assets that many say have the potential to usurp the system he used to work for.

Not a Real Currency

Speaking at Caixin’s 10th annual conference in Beijing, Trichet asserted that he is “strongly against Bitcoin,” adding that society is a “little complacent” in believing that cryptocurrencies have substance. “The [crypto]currency itself is not real, with the characteristics that a currency must have,” he asserted, echoing the sentiment pushed by billionaire investor Warren Buffet and others.

He added that buying cryptocurrencies is often a more of “pure speculation,” before quipping that the speculative nature of this market “is not healthy.”

Need for Bitcoin Growing

While this incumbent of traditional finance is bashing Bitcoin as a non-currency, the underlying need for the cryptocurrency is seemingly bigger than ever.

This week, Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, released his latest views on the macro environment on LinkedIn. While Dalio has undoubtedly benefited from the growth of the traditional economy, he sees holes in it.

These include but aren’t limited to extremely low, and even negative interest rates for the creditworthy, large government deficits that he believes are almost certain to “increase substantially,” the impending collapse of “sound finance” in “reserve currency countries and their currencies,” massive liabilities in pensions, and a growing wealth gap. Dalio remarked that all these factors have led him to believe that the “system of making capitalism work well for most people is broken.”

My below piece “The World Has Gone Mad and the System is Broken” explains some of the crazy things that are happening, why they are happening and why I believe that they are unsustainable. I’d be interested in knowing what you think about them. https://t.co/daUdsw0XLy — Ray Dalio (@RayDalio) November 5, 2019

So, what’s the solution? Bitcoin, according to some industry executives anyway.

The libertarian chief executive of ShapeShift, Erik Voorhees, wrote that Dalio’s comments only show the need for something like Bitcoin. Voorhees cited one facet of the post, in which Dalio stated that the collapse of the current system is likely to see governments try and “trap” the “rich capitalists,” who may attempt to move their capital and operations to places “in which the wealth gaps and conflicts [resulting from those gaps] are less severe.”

This, of course, would validate the need for an uncensorable, unseizable, decentralized, and non-sovereign money like Bitcoin.

Also, the Bridgewater founder’s assertion that “sound finance” will be thrown out the window, especially in countries like the U.S. and Japan, implies impending rampant inflation, which should aid the disinflationary Bitcoin.

Whether you call it the “halving” or the “halvening,” one of the few things we can be sure of in crypto is that the conversation around bitcoin’s upcoming reduction in mining reward will intensify over the next six months.

Why? Because previous halvings have triggered bull runs. And who doesn’t like a bull run?

Many are convinced that the next halving will have the same market effect, and it’s not just a belief that history repeats itself – models have emerged to support this theory.

But if the bull run is expected, why hasn’t it already happened? Why isn’t the halving already priced in?

Because the halving is much more than an event – it is also a narrative, and an uncertain one at that.

What and why

First, a review of what the halving is and why it happens.

To keep inflation under control, the bitcoin protocol was programmed with a hard limit of 21 million, with new bitcoins entering the system as an incentive for network processors (“miners”) in a gradual and controlled rhythm. The rate at which they are created is reduced by half every four years, ostensibly to mimic the increased difficulty of gold mining. On Nov. 28, 2012, the initial reward of 50 new bitcoins was halved to 25, and since July 9, 2016, miners have been receiving 12.5 bitcoins for each block successfully processed.

The next reduction, after which the network incentives will be 6.25 bitcoins per block, is expected in May 2020.



(source: Digital Asset Research – statistical model, not price predictions)

The above chart shows that the price (represented by the light blue line) started moving up before each of the previous halvings, and continued for some time after. Yet the data set is limited – the market has only experienced two of these events, and it could be a stretch to assume that the pattern will repeat itself.

That’s where some fundamental supply/demand analysis comes in.

Supply shock

Bitcoin investor and analyst Tuur Demeester recently pointed out that, for the cryptocurrency to maintain a price of over $8,000 until the next halving, the market would need to see $2.9 billion of investment inflow to offset the deflationary effect of new bitcoins entering the system. Even assuming investment growth remains constant, the reduction in selling pressure after the halving (with fewer new coins hitting the market) would lead to a price boost.

Pseudonymous trader Plan B has gone a step further and used the stock-to-flow (S2F) ratio – which divides current inventory by annual production – to create a model that retroactively predicts past price movements for bitcoin with a high degree of accuracy, using gold and silver as benchmarks. This model predicts a bitcoin price of almost $60,000 after the next halving (the black line in the chart above).

While this model has its critics, it has undergone rigorous cross-examination, and it seems that the regression holds up. It also makes intuitive sense: a reduction in supply should enhance value, all else being equal. So why isn’t the price already heading up to that lofty level?

This is where narrative comes in.

Technically, the halving isn’t a “fundamental” event, in that it does not represent a value driver in traditional investment terms. “Fundamental” in asset analysis refers to variable yet quantifiable features that can drive a valuation, such as profit, market size and balance sheet. In this sense, pre-programmed scarcity is not fundamental, it’s factual.

We can hope that facts themselves are not open to interpretation, but their impact almost always is. No one doubts the halving will happen – yet the narrative around its influence is not clear.

Let’s look at why.

Reasons for skepticism

First, some argue that the halving is already priced in. The move from $3,300 to $12,000 earlier this year? That was it. The market is relatively efficient in terms of information distribution, the argument goes, so smart investors would obviously have incorporated the supply adjustment into their models and taken positions accordingly.

Second, models tend to fit until they don’t. The bitcoin ecosystem today is arguably very different from previous halvings: four years ago, crypto derivatives markets were in their infancy, institutional involvement was slim and valuation frameworks were practically non-existent. It’s not unreasonable for investors to believe that “this time it’s different.”

Some industry insiders have hinted that the halving could be negative if it reduces miners’ profitability and forces many of the smaller ones out of the market. True, this could be offset by a price increase, but if that turns out to not be proportional, increased network centralization could trigger concerns about security.

Also, in traditional markets, price is rarely a function of supply. It’s more influenced by demand, which the S2F model does not take into account. In the absence of an established and widespread fundamental use case (for now), demand in crypto markets is narrative-driven.

Bull run ahead?

Yet in recursive logic, demand could be affected by the halving narrative. The widely held expectation that it will influence the price could stimulate demand for bitcoin as an investment asset, which will influence its price, especially as new investors – attracted by the supply models and historical correlation – enter the sector.

And asymmetric risk comes into the picture: the chance that the models are wrong and I lose everything will have less of an impact on my portfolio than the possibility the models are right and I make a 500% return.

So, even if the supply-driven models are trying to re-write traditional investing principles, it doesn’t mean that we won’t see a price rally.

If that happens, the narrative will coalesce around the confirmation that the supply-based models were right, even if they weren’t the cause. We could end up with the head-spinning cycle of narrative influencing price, and price influencing narrative.

Even so, this would not be the only head-spinning feature of the crypto markets over the coming months. The buzz around bitcoin’s supply schedule will highlight its unique economics, which in turn should awaken even more investor interest.

If this leads to more inflows at a time when new supply falls, the charts that predict a post-halving rally will turn out to have been right all along.

Then again, narratives can be fickle, and brave is the investor who assumes they’ll hold. They also rarely thrive in isolation – and, let’s face it, there are a lot of things going on out there that can have as great an influence on bitcoin’s price.

Either way, it’s hard to deny that the emergence of forecasting models is a positive step that will help us understand market dynamics and bitcoin’s role in a broader financial market. Sophisticated investors will no doubt both welcome these and treat the underlying assumptions with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Halved persimmon fruit image by Rodrigo Argenton via Wikimedia Commons",2019-11-10 11:20:16+00:00,https://coinrivet.com/bobby-lee-ballet/,"It wasn’t long since my plane had hit the tarmac on the Blockchain Island. I arrived at my hotel. They had no record of my booking, the taxi had left, and I had to walk to my new lodgings some 10 minutes away. Not that far, you might say. But that’s perhaps because you haven’t dragged a suitcase across Malta’s charming cobbled streets (or swerved by its not-so-charming gaping chasms in the pavement). In the drizzly November rain.

Bobby Lee can be very persuasive

I quickly refreshed at the hotel I eventually found with the aid of Google Maps and then rushed to meet Bobby Lee at the Intercontinental. If you’re not familiar with the name, he’s the co-founder of the first Chinese exchange BTCC, founder and CEO of Ballet hardware cryptocurrency wallet and brother of the charismatic Litecoin founder, Charlie Lee. He also exchanged some heated words with Nouriel Roubini at last month’s CC Forum.

He wasn’t here to swap travel stories though. When I enquired about his journey, he said it was “long” and quickly followed up with “sorry, how long will this take?”

While he didn’t immediately put me at ease, he had a point. If we’re to take Bitcoin to the masses and really make this “permissionless technology” work, there’s a lot to be done. Less idle chat and more action.

That may be why his new hardware wallet Ballet went from a “conception” in January to its sixth iteration and pre-sale sample in under a year. Clearly, when Bobby gets an idea in his head, he’s like a dog with a bone. And before I knew what was happening, I was handing him over 50 euros and he was sending me the corresponding BTC to my new Ballet wallet.

Onboarding the masses

I’ll admit to a little healthy scepticism when it comes to the Ballet. After all, it’s a hardware wallet with no back-up seed. Your private keys are also engraved on the front.

What does this mean? Well, several things. One, it’s a heck of a lot easier to onboard people when they don’t have to go through the “cumbersome and stressful” experience that hardware wallets evoke.

“It makes it really easy for normal people to buy and hold Bitcoin”, he says. “There’s no setup, the address is pre-generated on here, so they just use it. We wanted to create a wallet that was simple to use with no setup at all”. But, to do that, of course, they had to make a trade-off.

Having a Ballet wallet is literally like holding a bar of gold or rare piece of jewellery. Great, if it’s in your hands; lose it and your investment is gone forever. Not exactly a comforting thought.

Bobby says, “It’s not like a credit or debit card. If you were to lose it, sorry, it’s like a piece of gold, do not lose it”, he reiterates for emphasis, “don’t lose it”.

Bitcoin for everyday people

“If you want backup there are many other solutions out there”, he continues, “such as Coinbase or one of the hardware wallets you mentioned [Ledger and Trezor]. Ballet is a bare instrument, with this, you can give a gift”.

I stop him at that moment and ask whether the fact that he called it a “gift” meant that it was for small-time holders, sort of like a gift card. “It’s for everyone”, he replies.

So, then, would Bobby Lee keep all his bitcoin on it?

Not on your life.

“I don’t,” he admits, “but I am a very advanced user so I keep my personal coins in different places, different devices, different technologies. If you have $1,000 of cryptocurrency, you can keep it here,” he points to the Ballet wallet. “If you have $1 million, you’re probably an advanced user and have different solutions”.

Everything about Ballet is designed to easily onboard new users – including its name. To convey “elegance, simplicity, and to be female-friendly”.

Bobby says that to attract a wider audience, they decided to choose that name, “all the names if you look at the conference rooms, all very geeky, male-dominated tech names, so we wanted something approachable”.

Give me 50 euros and I will show you how this works

Like any great salesman, Bobby understands the psychology of selling well (for as much as he studied computer science and has always worked in tech). He first gifted me the wallet. He then asked me for cash to purchase the coin of my choice – BTC obviously – although you can store multiple coins on this wallet.

I didn’t want to look cheap in front of the Chinese millionaire who had been swapping stories with (and gifting Ballets to) Bruce Willis days before, so I said I’d buy 50 euros’ worth.

What did Bobby think of the American actor, by the way? “He’s not really into Bitcoin”, he laughs. I asked if he managed to convince him. “No”, he sighed and chortled, “he said I should talk to his wife”.

We went through the process of sending and receiving BTC from one Ballet wallet to another. It’s extremely simple and exceptionally fast–near-instant, in fact.

You don’t have to wait for blockchain confirmation times either, but can immediately start to convert, send, or use your digital assets. Elegant and graceful, just as the name. And a whole lot easier than plugging in your Trezor.

Chinese regulation and the development of the space

We speak a little more about the enthusiasm for blockchain coming out of China and whether it’s bullish for the space or not.

“I am a purist when it comes to blockchain”, he says. “I think blockchain is only blockchain if it’s a decentralised public blockchain. Anything that’s private or controlled really isn’t a blockchain”.

So, China’s advances aren’t bullish for the industry then? He shakes his head, “that’s not what I’m saying”.

He believes that having a digital RMB will be good by making its movement much easier, without third party entities or bank accounts. This will also, he believes, eventually bring eyes onto Bitcoin. It will get people used to using the technology and make it easier to buy Bitcoin with a digital RMB.

Ballet cryptocurrency wallet – the takeaway

Honestly, I love Ballet for what it’s trying to achieve and I think Bobby is attempting to counter a serious issue. But, he himself more or less called it a gift card, and that’s a pretty good description of it.

You would be extremely unwise to hold all your crypto in a wallet that you can never regain access to or that has your private keys stamped on the front.

It’s not an oversight, though. I think Bobby Lee sees Ballet as a sort of a ‘gateway drug’ to the world of Bitcoin – and a stepping stone to people finding out about different cold storage options.

Just like the dance, Ballet may not be to everyone’s taste. But if you’re the sort of person who always knows exactly where your belongings are and you’re interested in buying crypto, it could be a good place to start.",2019-11-10 08:28:37+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/becoming-nakamoto-how-satoshi-created-his-alter-ego/,"Becoming Nakamoto: How Satoshi Created His Alter-Ego

Captain America began life as Steve Rogers. Tony Stark only created Iron Man after being kidnapped. Bruce Wayne spent seven years in ninja training before eventually returning to Gotham as Batman. We don’t know Satoshi Nakamoto’s birth name, but we do know something about the steps he took to create Bitcoin and indelibly forge his alter-ego.

Unmasking the Legend of Satoshi

We don’t know who Satoshi is or was, but like the superheroes of today’s Marvel and DC movies, beneath the mask was a flawed human capable of extraordinary things. Deifying – or rather superhero-ifying – any one man is the antithesis of everything Bitcoin stands for. Indeed, it may have been the growing cult of Satoshi that sent Bitcoin’s creator scurrying into exile. For evocative purposes, however, the superhero metaphor works. Just think about it:

One man, taking on a corrupt system (central banking). The assumption of a pseudonym to protect his identity. The need to separate his personal and professional life (there could be no Tony Stark reveal of his Iron Man alter-ego). The need to operate as a lone wolf for years with no assistance or remuneration. Constant threats to his mission and his freedom from enemies determined to see him fail. Satoshi didn’t wear a cape, but when his movie is made, it belongs in the superhero genre.

2007: Humble Beginnings

“I actually did this kind of backwards,” confessed Satoshi in an email to Hal Finney. “I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.” It’s likely that Nakamoto began work on Bitcoin before he had conceived his pseudonymous character. “The design and coding started in 2007,” he explained, likely occurring towards the start of the year. It wasn’t known as Bitcoin at that point, assuming the working title of “Electronic Cash Without a Trusted Third Party.”

By the end of 2007, we can deduce that Satoshi had conceived the basics of what would become Bitcoin: a means of sending electronic payments “from one party to another without the burdens of going through a financial institution.” To achieve this, Satoshi had made a major breakthrough in solving the double-spend problem by postulating a chain of hash-based proof-of-work. This would form a timestamped record that could not be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. It was, he would later explain, “a solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.”

Satoshi’s eureka moment may have arrived in 2007, but Bitcoin was still little more than a concept. It consisted of a few thousand lines of incomplete code and was lacking the ingredients that would make for a decentralized currency: working software, a coin issuance schedule, block times, and most of the other components that would prove integral to Bitcoin as we know it. If Satoshi had thought the late nights and endless redrafting sessions of 2007 were exhausting, they were nothing compared to what the following year would throw his way.

2008: First Contact

As 2008 ground into gear, Satoshi found his to-do list getting longer by the day. Up until now, he’d been focused on the mechanics of his electronic cash system, and would spend the first half of 2008 codifying his ideas into what would become the Bitcoin whitepaper. But he also had other pressing concerns: soon Satoshi knew he would have to break cover and go public. At the same time, he would have to conceal his tracks. The year prior, the founders of Liberty Reserve had been sentenced to five years in jail for operating its forerunner, digital currency exchange Gold Age, without a financial license.

Satoshi knew he would have to create a robust pseudonym that could not be linked to his real identity. But he was also shrewd enough to recognize the need for a moniker with a certain mystique to it. Even in the unmarketable underworld of cryptography mailing lists, a memorable name will stick. Where he plucked it from, we will never know. What we do know is that Satoshi Nakamoto has a pleasing ring to it. Once Satoshi had settled on his superhero alter-ego, there could be no going back.

By the time Satoshi had chosen his name, he had also settled on a name for his electronic cash system: Bitcoin. On August 18, 2008, he registered the domain bitcoin.org via anonymousspeech.com. Four days later, Satoshi made his first known contact with the world, emailing Wei Dai from satoshi@anonymousspeech.com, and including a link to an early release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. It is believed that Satoshi may have emailed Adam Back prior to this; if so, the event probably occurred earlier that August.

Fall 2008: Bitcoin Begins

Satoshi’s earliest interactions with the cryptography community have all the hallmarks of a fledgling superhero still getting accustomed to their newfound powers. He was modest and disarmingly humble, especially so in these initial exchanges, when no one knew who Satoshi was and had no reason to care. Through late 2008 and into January 2009, his comms were unfailingly polite: “Sorry if I didn’t make that clear” and “I’d appreciate it. Thanks, Satoshi.”

Even at this stage, when there was every chance that Bitcoin would not catch on, it was evident that Satoshi had thought everything out – from his entry right through to his exit strategy. In addition to going to great lengths to anonymously register bitcoin.org and conduct all of his business from behind a proxy or seven, Satoshi appears to have begun changing his spelling to put further distance between his persona and his pseudonym. Satoshi’s writing style will be the subject of a future analysis by news.Bitcoin.com. For now, it is worth noting that his well-documented British spelling is an idiosyncrasy Satoshi appears to have acquired in 2008, with mixed results at first as he got into character.

On October 31, 2008, Satoshi published his whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list, explaining “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” Even at this stage, there was much about Bitcoin that was still undecided or unrevealed, including the 21 million supply, which appears to have been finalized shortly before Satoshi shared v0.1 of Bitcoin’s code on January 9, 2009.

It’s easy to assign inevitability to the rise of Bitcoin, using the gift of hindsight. The reality, though, is that in its nascent months, Bitcoin’s survival chances were probably no greater than 50-50, and even optimists would have tipped it to be adopted by a few thousand believers at best. As Mike Hearn was to later recall, “At the time bitcoins had no value at all and nobody else was using the system … It was just an interesting science project on SourceForge, one of many, which seemed destined to sink into obscurity.”

Satoshi’s genius lies not only in his ability to solve the double-spend problem, or to eliminate trusted third parties. He painfully created an undoxxable persona that has, as far as we know, withstood unmasking attempts from armchair sleuths and three-letter agencies alike. Satoshi is more than a spur-of-the-moment epithet coined by a man who wanted to preserve his privacy: like a pre-fame superhero, his character was born in the darkness, forged in steel and years in the making.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has revealed the agency is cracking down on “dozens” of cryptocurrency users evading taxes. The IRS has partnered with tax agencies from four other countries in order to make sure tax enforcement strategies are being applied across the map.

Tax Agencies From 5 Countries Are Hunting Dozens of Tax Evaders Using Digital Currencies

According to the IRS, the tax agency is putting a significant amount of effort into fighting tax evasion that stems from cryptocurrency use. Speaking on a phone call with the press, a senior agent in the IRS’s Criminal Investigations office based in L.A., Ryan Korner, says when digital currencies became popularized, the tax agency had issues keeping up with alleged tax evaders. However, the IRS has gained “expertise” when it comes to individuals “moving the money.” “We have tools in place that we didn’t have six months or a year ago,” Korner told reporters on Friday. The revelation follows the IRS announcement at the end of July which explained that 10,000 American residents who have owned cryptocurrencies would receive warning letters from the U.S. tax entity. Then in October, the IRS unveiled a new draft tax form that requires filers to answer whether or not they have used a digital currency during the year. Some 150 million Americans file tax returns with the 1040 tax form that poses the virtual currency question.

This week the IRS disclosed they had a meeting with four other nation states so they can partner together to fight cross-border tax evasion stemming from digital currency users. The five-country group is called the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement or J5. The J5 includes the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) and Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the Dutch Fiscale Inlichtingen- en Opsporingsdienst (FIOD), the British HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), and the American Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). The group of J5 investigators told the press this week that cyber-related activities tied to crimes like data breaches and ransomware are being used to commit tax evasion as well.

“Tax fraud is not a new crime, but the sophistication with which criminals commit tax fraud has significantly increased through cyber-related activities in recent years,” the J5 task force said in a statement. “Data breaches, intrusions, takeovers, and compromises are the new tools that criminals use to commit tax crimes.”

A Wave of Tax Audits

According to the latest report, after sending 10,000 letters to American taxpayers, the IRS now has plans to start a new wave of tax audits and criminal investigations. The tax agency warns that the effort is quite serious and people avoiding taxes via cryptocurrencies may be subject to tax evasion charges and penalties on the gains tied to virtual investments. “That data doesn’t go and sit — We use that data,” Korner stressed. The American tax agency recently issued its first digital currency tax guidance since 2014 and the guidelines contain controversial tax liabilities created by cryptocurrency forks. The tax liability only applies if the forked asset was used by the owner and the person spends or moves the coins. “If your cryptocurrency went through a hard fork, but you did not receive any new cryptocurrency, whether through an airdrop (a distribution of cryptocurrency to multiple taxpayers’ distributed ledger addresses) or some other kind of transfer, you don’t have taxable income,” the IRS cryptocurrency guidance letter reads.

The U.K. also followed the IRS’s lead by issuing digital currency guidance for businesses on November 1. Individual UK taxpayers who have used cryptocurrency in the past saw fresh guidelines delivered at the end of 2018. The reports issued by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) explain how businesses and individuals residing in the UK should file their tax obligations. The J5 task force cracking down on “dozens” of cryptocurrency users evading taxes is part of a globalized effort the organization started in June 2018.

“We will collaborate internationally to reduce the growing threat to tax administrations posed by cryptocurrencies and cybercrime and to make the most of data and technology,” the J5 task force emphasized to the public last year.

Bitcoin’s consecutive weekly losses and multiple failures at key resistance have shifted risk in favor of a drop to around $8,550 and perhaps as low as $8,000.

Daily chart indicators have turned bearish for the first time in over a month, supporting the case for a deeper decline.

A high-volume move above $9,335 (descending trendline from 2019 high) is needed to revive the bullish view.

Bitcoin is looking south after back-to-back weekly losses and multiple rejections at key price resistance.

The top cryptocurrency by market value fell 2.6 percent and 3 percent in the weeks ended Nov. 3 and 10, respectively.

Importantly, BTC has also failed for three straight weeks to close (Sunday, UTC) above the 3.5-month trendline sloping downwards from the 2019 high of $13,880. Acceptance above that hurdle would have meant a revival of the bull market set in motion by a solid break above $5,000 in early April.

The inability to pass that level (currently around $9,335) has weakened the bullish case put forward by the high-volume rise from $7,300 to $10,300 on Oct. 25–26.

Markets usually test dip demand after multiple rejections at key resistance and bitcoin is already feeling the pull of gravity. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at $8,680 on Bitstamp, representing a 1 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

Losses could be extended further with the 200-day moving average support now breached. The barometer of long-term market trend is currently located at $9,236. Other technical indicators have also turned bearish over the weekend.

Weekly chart

BTC is losing altitude, having faced rejection at the descending trendline for three straight weeks.

The 14-week relative strength index (RSI) remains in bearish territory below resistance at 53.00. It’s worth noting that the 53.00–55.00 range acted as a strong support throughout the 2016–2017 bull run.

Hence, a move above 55.00, if and when it occurs, could be taken as a confirmation of bull market.

Monthly and daily charts

Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the descending, bearish 5-candle MA (above left), as represented by the November candle’s upper wick, is translating into a price drop, as expected.

The MACD histogram on the daily chart (right) has crossed below zero over the weekend and is currently signaling at its most bearish since Oct. 3 with a -59.00 reading. The RSI is currently bearish below 50.

BTC has also found acceptance below the 200-day MA – a level that acted as strong support in the nine days to Nov. 7.

All-in-all, BTC appears on track to test and possibly breach the 50-day MA at $8,552. A violation there would expose the psychological support of $8,000.

On the higher side, a convincing move above the 3.5-month descending trendline hurdle, currently at $9,335, is needed to confirm a bullish breakout.

Published today, Nov. 11, the coverage is exceptional given China’s abiding hardline stance against decentralized cryptocurrencies, as epitomized by Beijing’s historic September 2017 blanket ban on crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings.

Even-handed exposure

The Xinhua article is broadly positive and detailed in its coverage of Bitcoin and the history of its development and evolution.

It opens by posing the question of whether the coin represents the “inevitable trend of future currency development or just another ‘tulip’ hype?” Given this formulation reproduces a long-standing industry platitude, it arguably leans more toward rhetorical convention than polemic.

The article continues to describe the core principles of blockchain as a decentralized, immutable and trustless system for the peer-to-peer transfer of value, covering aspects such as mining, digital scarcity and pseudonymity.

It is in regard to this latter — again, similarly to much Western mainstream media coverage of cryptocurrencies — that the article flags up the potential risks of Bitcoin, arguing that purportedly “the most important uses of Bitcoin payments are black market transactions and ‘dark net’ transactions.”

Xinhua also emphasizes the volatility of Bitcoin as a currency that is not backed by a centralized sovereign power — as distinct from national fiat currencies.

However, the article is notably free of hyperbole or demonization, prompting some readers to propose that the coverage represents the “first time Bitcoin got such positive exposure” from the Chinese government.

A turning tide?

As reported, President Xi’s recent high-profile endorsement of blockchain innovation in recent weeks was accompanied by the signing of the first national law regulating cryptography, governing various aspects of blockchain, due to come into effect this January.

The country’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, is also expected to become the first major global economy to launch a central bank digital currency as other countries, such as Tunisia, are already getting a head start.

More Jobs, Fewer Searches

Jobs in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are on the rise, according to Indeed, a leading job listing platform and search engine. The company analyzed millions of job postings on Indeed.com to determine the current state of the crypto job market in the U.S. The results were published Thursday by the company’s tech hiring platform, Seen by Indeed.

“According to Indeed.com, in the four-year period between September 2015 and September 2019, the share of these jobs per million grew by 1,457%. In that same time period, the share of searches per million increased by ‘only’ 469%,” a blog post on Seen by Indeed’s website details. Looking at data over the past year alone, crypto job listings increased by 26% while crypto job searches decreased by 53%.

The number of job postings grew the most between 2017-18 while the number of job searches grew the most in 2016-17. This year, the number of crypto jobs searched decreased for the first time. The company also revealed that the top five tech jobs in the industry are software engineers, senior software engineers, software architects, full stack developers, and front end developers.

Crypto investor Michael Terpin lost roughly 1,5oo bitcoins on January 7, 2018, after falling victim to a SIM swap attack, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The bitcoin stake was worth $24 million that day, roughly three weeks after the asset hit its record high price.

The incredibly precise hack involves thieves taking control of a phone number and using it to access email accounts, bank reserves, and even crypto wallets.

One crypto investor lost bitcoin worth as much as $24 million after falling victim to a new kind of hack known as SIM swapping, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Michael Terpin was hit by the attack on January 7, 2018, days after bitcoin reached its record high price. Thieves stole roughly 1,500 bitcoins by taking control of his phone number and using Google's ""Forgot password?"" feature to gain access to his email. With possession of the two personal accounts, the thieves hacked Terpin's crypto wallet, stole the digital assets and quickly sold them, according to WSJ.

Bitcoin traded between $16,969 and $15,790 per coin on January 7, 2018. The digital coin now trades at roughly $8,700.

SIM swaps involve stealing an individual's phone number and using it to gain access to numerous other accounts. Once a hacker can breach a user's email account, they can scour for proof of asset holdings and subsequently target trading apps, bank accounts, and crypto wallets.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was hit with a SIM swap attack on August 30, allowing hackers to post racist and anti-Semitic tweets to his account.

The January SIM swap attack wasn't Terpin's first. He had been hacked in the same way seven months earlier, but didn't lose any assets then.

Following the first hack, the crypto investor added additional security measures to his AT&T account, including a six-digit PIN required for any future changes, according to WSJ. He also switched out text-message authentication for Google's authentication service.

""On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say my security protections were a 9.8 or higher. But these hackers, all they do is sit around in a basement and figure out ways of hacking people,"" Terpin told WSJ, noting he thinks employees at an AT&T authorized store gave hackers control of his phone number.

SIM swaps are incredibly precise, and the odds of randomly being hit by one are small compared to other hacks. Adding passcodes to a mobile account, using a password-management app, exploring ""forgot my password"" options, and using other forms of two-factor authentication can help protect phone numbers from SIM hackers, according to WSJ.

But a new breed of banks specializing in crypto have been working hard to take advantage of this trend and are gaining regulatory recognition around the world.

Swiss Crypto Banks Are Going Global

Switzerland has established itself as a leading crypto-friendly nation and several hundred companies from the industry are currently operating out of the crypto valley centered in the canton of Zug. The country’s financial regulators have been gradually opening towards the nascent sector. Traditional banks have been reluctant to serve entities dealing with cryptocurrencies but competition from new businesses focusing specifically on the crypto market is likely to change that.

In August, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) licensed two companies to provide banking services to Swiss-based crypto businesses and also trade securities. Zug-registered Seba Crypto and Zurich-based Sygnum became Switzerland’s first regulated crypto banks. Another entity working with digital assets, Bitcoin Suisse, applied for a banking and securities dealer license this summer. A new venture called Tallyon expects the green light from Finma to become a ‘next generation’ private bank employing blockchain tech and working with cryptocurrencies.

These companies are not restricting themselves to Switzerland only. In late October, Sygnum was granted a capital markets services license in Singapore. According to a report by Swissinfo, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has authorized the crypto bank to provide asset management services in the Southeast Asian city-state. Seba Crypto, which is currently focusing primarily on its upcoming launch in Switzerland, is in talks with the MAS but is yet to apply for a license. It plans to enter a number of other markets including Hong Kong, the U.K., Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal, and the Netherlands. Tallyon plans for an Asian expansion too, after its launch in the Alpine country.

In a press release published on its website, Sygnum revealed their first product will be a multi-manager fund which “allocates investments across a portfolio of managers that tap into the global digital asset opportunity using different and uncorrelated investment strategies.” It will be available to institutional and private qualified investors in Switzerland in the future as well, through the company’s banking platform there. In partnership with the largest German stock exchange and Swisscom, Sygnum is also working to launch a new digital asset trading venue.

China’s Tencent Licensed to Operate ‘Virtual Bank’ in Hong Kong

The expansion of the crypto industry in any jurisdiction inevitably creates demand for related banking services. China’s recent focus on blockchain development is likely to have the same effect. Some Chinese companies are already moving to take advantage of the changing environment that creates new business opportunities.

Tencent, the tech and internet giant behind the popular messenger Wechat, has recently received a license from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) that will allow it to establish a ‘virtual bank.’ Speaking at the World Blockchain Conference in Wuzhen on Nov. 8, Cai Weige, general manager for blockchain at Tencent, revealed the holding is already gathering a team for the financial platform.

According to Chinese media, the forum was devoted to blockchain, digital assets, central bank digital currency, artificial intelligence, and 5G. During his keynote speech at the conference, the high-ranking Tencent representative noted that blockchain and cryptocurrencies receive more attention now that the Hong Kong government has begun to regulate crypto transactions.

The SFC recently established a new regulatory framework that allows crypto exchanges to opt-in to be licensed and regulated, as news.Bitcoin.com reported last week. Trading platforms can now apply for a license if they meet certain requirements, including the implementation of measures to guarantee the safe custody of crypto assets.

While companies like Tencent and the Swiss fintech startups are competing to offer the best banking services to the crypto industry, traditional financial institutions have largely shied away from digital assets. That’s likely to change over time though, with the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. For example, the Basel Committee, which includes banking regulators from the U.S., Europe and Japan, has just agreed to study the capital requirements for crypto assets held by traditional banks. But the steps in that direction are still few and by the time banks get there, the crypto banking sector will probably be occupied by plenty of ‘next generation’ banks.

The news was reported by New York real estate magazine The Real Deal on Nov. 1.

Shaoul — who is president of the Magnum Real Estate Group — sold the 11,400-square-foot property to a Taiwan-based entity “Affluent International LCC,” according to a person familiar with the deal.

Luxury properties increasingly bought and sold for BTC

While Shaoul himself has reportedly declined to comment, Eric Hedvat — a broker with Jet Real Estate, which represented Magnum in the deal — characterized the transaction as “a seamless process.”

Magnum reportedly went into contract with two other buyers in the same building using Bitcoin in 2018 — one for a 624-square-foot studio at an asking price of $875,000 and the other a 989-square-foot one-bedroom at $1.48 million.

Another of Shaoul’s residential developments had been listed with an option to purchase using Bitcoin but was eventually sold for cash to Bronx-based investor Martin Shapiro last year for $82 million.

Beyond Magnum, the Real Deal notes that Brooklyn-based rental management company announced in 2018 that it would be accepting cryptocurrency as payment.

A current listing for a $29 million property on the Upper East Side, marketed by Corocan, notes the seller will “accept payment in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple.”

Aimed at high net worth Scandinavians and institutional investors globally, the fund is an investment branch of Arcane, a crypto firm running a technology team, trading arm and a crypto news portal Kryptografen.com.

Arcane Crypto CEO Torbjorn Bull Jenssen is a widely cited crypto expert in Norway and a white paper published earlier this year shows their team is watching the industry closely, but doesn’t provide any clues to the investment strategy.

Wall said that he could not disclose precisely which assets will be Arcane’s focus, but that outperformance separate from the revaluation of bitcoin would be the metric:

“I expect that the metric that really matters is how funds perform against bitcoin. Once the dust starts to settle on that, it’s going to be clear who’s been swimming naked.”

Some altcoin could also make it into Arcane’s portfolio, Wall hinted, but only those strictly selected:

“We are seeing a maturing trend in the altcoin market. It’s already very different now than it was a few years ago. It’s becoming harder and harder for technically inept projects to fake-it-til-you-make-it. There’s only in a very few, select areas in the cryptocurrency design space that has merit to compete against bitcoin.”

Rather than measuring performance against fiat, the goal is to trade digital currencies to increase the size of the portfolio, in bitcoin.

Arcane Crypto was founded by Norwegian investors Ketil Skorstad and Kristian G. Lundqvist, and also funded by Morten Klein, a poker player and chairman of the Swedish casinos company Cherry, in an undisclosed round this April.

All three investors are from Norway, hence the Scandinavian slant of the fund.

Wall had spent more than three years at Cinnober, a company selling tech solutions for stock and crypto exchanges, and was used to explaining crypto to people in traditional finance, but in English, not in Norwegian

“We will have a special focus on the Nordics, but it’s not exclusive,” Wall added.

In a recent podcast interview, Stroustrup took a moment to explain how he felt about programmers using C++ for such a wide variety of applications.

Mostly, it was pretty reasonable. He likened releasing C++ to building a tool, in that he can’t control how it’s going to be used.

“You try to improve the tool by looking at how it’s being used, and when people cut their fingers off, and try and stop that from happening. But really, you have no control over how something is used,” said Stroustrup.

Then, he mentioned Bitcoin, which Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in C++.

“So, I’m very happy and proud of some of the things [that] C++ is being used [for], and some of the things I wish people wouldn’t do. Bitcoin mining being my favorite example, [it] uses as much energy as Switzerland and mostly serves criminals,” he added.

Indeed, the debate around Bitcoin‘s energy consumption is real. Mining Bitcoin means using large amounts of electricity to solve a complex maths puzzle that’s rewarded with digital currency.

Typically, miners immediately sell Bitcoin they generate to cover their costs. Whether you consider this a worthwhile endeavour really comes down to how much you value censorship-resistant money, which seems to go over Stroustrup’s head, at least currently.

However, Bitcoin “mostly” facilitating criminal activity, while unproven, is ultimately a function of that censorship resistance.

Sure, it’d be nice if Stroustrup was proud of the fact that Nakamoto built Bitcoin using his magnum opus.

But, if he’s stuck worrying about Bitcoin’s energy usage matching a country of just 8 million people, convincing him otherwise is probably a lost cause, however brilliant C++ may be.",2019-11-11

As innovation economy news outlet The Logic reported on Nov. 11, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is now rumored to be considering the plans.

RBC reportedly planning multifunctional exchange

RBC is the largest bank in Canada by market capitalization, with $661 billion CAD ($499 billion) in assets under management.

According to The Logic, the bank is entertaining the possibility for the exchange to function both for investments and allowing clients to make purchases online and in brick-and-mortar stores.

The news follows a previous report that Canada’s central bank wanted to use digital currency in order to better track consumer spending habits.

“The trading platform would facilitate buying and selling of individual digital coins, including Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), as well as the transfer of funds combining different types of cryptocurrencies,” the publication summarized.

Bitcoin purchases “not allowed”

While little detailed information is currently available, the move would run conspicuously in contrast to RBC’s current modus operandi on cryptocurrencies. Last year, the bank abruptly banned clients purchasing Bitcoin or altcoins with credit and debit cards.

“Effective immediately, RBC will no longer be allowing the use of RBC credit cards for transactions involving cryptocurrency. We regret any inconvenience this may cause,” a notice stated at the time.

Other Canadian banks had previously done likewise, including TD Bank and Bank of Montreal.

Nonetheless, attention has since focused on how authorities will handle the fallout from QuadrigaCX, a local cryptocurrency exchange that imploded in late 2018. While recovery of lost funds is ongoing, users lost a total of around $190 million in deposits.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/all/canadian-bank-changes-bitcoin-tune-may-launch-cryptocurrency-exchange/,"The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is exploring building a cryptocurrency trading platform for both investments and in-store/online purchases.

This move would make the bank — the largest in Canada by market capitalization, with $661 billion CAD ($499 billion) in assets under management — the first in the country to launch a cryptocurrency exchange.

The trading platform would facilitate the buying and selling of individual digital coins, including Bitcoin and Ether, as well as bundled crypto assets. RBC also plans to offer customers the ability to open accounts to safely store their digital coins, according to The Logic

RBC Cryptocurrency Patents

Although full details surrounding the bank’s plans are not yet available, RBC has applied for four patents in Canada and the U.S that provide insights on how it plans to integrate cryptocurrency into its operations.

The U.S. patent applications, which were filed in April and became public in October, discuss how the bank can take advantage of the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies.

One patent reads: “To individual users, managing cryptographic keys and transacting with different cryptographic assets can be a challenge. In some situations, cryptographic asset transactions may take time to be confirmed, and/or may not be compatible or supported by merchant systems or point-of-sale devices.”

As of press time, RBC did respond to The Logic’s request for comment, including whether it plans to launch a cryptocurrency trading platform and if so, when it would launch.

“As part of the innovation and discovery process, RBC, like many other organizations, files patent applications to ensure proprietary ideas and concepts are protected,” RBC spokesperson Jean Francois Thibault said.

Change of Tune

RBC’s move may come as a surprise to some: last year, the bank abruptly banned its clients from purchasing cryptocurrencies with credit and debit cards, following similar moves by others like TD Bank and Bank of Montreal.

That said, in the past three years RBC has published 27 blockchain-related patents dealing with vehicle records, digital rewards, smart contracts, loan offerings, and a variety of investment vehicles.

Canada has a number of small cryptocurrency exchanges, but many have run into issues, regulatory and otherwise. Just last week, Vancouver-based Einstein Exchange, which owes customers over $16 million, filed for bankruptcy.

Earlier this year, Vancouver-based QuadrigaCX, which owes nearly $215 million, went bankrupt after its CEO died in 2018 and no one could obtain the information on the private key he used to access funds on the exchange.

RBC’s applications suggest how it plans to avoid those kinds of issues, ensuring that private keys are easily locatable, while also abiding by other regulations, such as anti-money-laundering provisions.",2019-11-12 17:24:42+00:00,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/12/big-canadian-bank-rumored-to-offer-cryptocurrency-accounts-bitcoin-trading/,"The Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is reportedly developing a cryptocurrency platform, The Logic reports.

If launched, the bank‘s customers will be able to trade in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin BTC and Ethereum.

The bank, one of the country’s largest, is also looking to let customers open cryptocurrency accounts.

According to The Block, one of the bank‘s patent applications says the following:

“To individual users, managing cryptographic keys and transacting with different cryptographic assets can be a challenge. In some situations, cryptographic asset transactions may take time to be confirmed, and/or may not be compatible or supported by merchant systems or point-of-sale devices.”

But, Jean Francois Thibault, an RBC spokesperson told the Logic that the bank “like many other organizations, files patent applications to ensure proprietary ideas and concepts are protected.” Thibault declined to comment further.

Although little is known at this stage, this is not the first time that a bank has dipped its toes into the blockchain space.

In September 2017, Reuters reported that the bank was experimenting with blockchain in a bid to facilitate payments between its US and Canadian banks.

More recently, RBC and several other Canadian banks started using blockchain technology to allow customers to digitally prove their identity.

Blockchain‘s potential to maximize efficiency and significantly reduce costs has been lauded for some time, so it’s hardly surprising that banks are trying to jump on the blockchain bandwagon.

Fast-forward 12 months and cryptocurrencies in commercial terms is still juvenile.

After the hype of 2017 into 2018 with cryptocurrencies and initial coin offering fundraises hitting record highs, the “Crypto Winter” that followed seems to have cleared out the majority of scams, over-hyped projects without substance and excessive risk. It is always difficult to predict where immature technology and economic activity might go. However, there are signs that we are entering a “Crypto Spring” with well-funded projects, blockchain patents and a maturing of the crypto space.

I think it’s likely that there will be two main developments:

Cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin, as a deflationary currency, will continue to appreciate in value longer term and other cryptocurrencies that seek to act as a store of value will follow this path. There will also be a clearer distinction between forms of cryptocurrencies as payment tokens, utility tokens, asset tokens and security tokens. The market will become increasingly sophisticated to understand the differences, assisted by greater regulatory scrutiny and clarification.

Blockchain

This and other forms of distributed ledger technology will start to be applied as solutions to genuine problems, albeit in a more limited form than prophesised by blockchain evangelists rather than as solutions looking for a problem to solve (or worse, fabricating a problem to which someone’s blockchain was the magic solution).

Will there be a crypto crash?

There will continue to be bull and bear runs as the crypto ecosystem matures. However, at the same time, the magnitude of the runs will tend to settle down as the market becomes more sophisticated and regulatory oversight starts to increasingly bite.

Will crypto replace centralised financial systems?

Not anytime soon. Governments and incumbent financial institutions have taken the momentum out of the original drive that built up between 2009 and 2017. These large actors have ingested that same momentum and are now looking at how they use crypto technology to augment (if not entrench) existing financial systems.

Going into 2020

The appetite for cryptocurrency and fintech innovation has increased again this year. Bitcoin reached $1bn in cumulative transaction fees on the eleventh anniversary of the world’s first cryptocurrency and according to a study by job site Indeed.com the share of cryptocurrency jobs per million has risen 1,457% over the past four years. Add to this mix that China has announced it is ready to roll out the world’s first digitised domestic currency, attracting the attention of financial service industries across the globe, and it is clear that this is an industry that will only continue to grow. The big challenge for regulators will be to keep pace with such financial innovations.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/swiss-crypto-bank-seba-launches-with-range-of-services/,"Swiss Crypto Bank SEBA Launches With Range of Services

SEBA Bank Now Fully Operational

Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, SEBA Bank AG announced on Tuesday that it is now fully operational and has started onboarding customers in Switzerland. Formerly called SEBA Crypto AG, the bank obtained a banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in August and began testing its products with a selected group of customers. Noting that Swiss clients can now officially open an account, the bank elaborated:

As a bank licensed by a reputed supervisory authority, it can offer a comprehensive range of services in the field of digital assets and cryptocurrencies, as well as in traditional banking.

With the aim of building a bridge between the traditional banking world and the new crypto world, the bank is offering a range of integrated services in the areas of asset management, trading, custody, and financing.

“SEBA customers can invest in both traditional and digital assets, store them, trade them and take out loans – now via an integrated interface,” the bank described. “Regulation is crucial for the protection of investors – the idea of an integrated and supervised bank with focus on digital assets arose from the growing demand for investment alternatives and the increasing affinity for technology and process engineering.” In its Tuesday announcement, the bank further revealed that it plans to offer services to “clients from selected foreign jurisdictions” in December.

Crypto Services Offered

Founded in April last year, the bank raised CHF 100 million (~$100.7 million) from investors five months later to build a licensed bank and securities dealer. According to its website, the bank has partnered with Julius Bar, Finstar, Smarttrade Technologies, Geissbuhler Weber & Partner, Loomis International, Jaeksoft Sarl, and BPC. Its services are aimed at professional investors, family offices, banks, asset managers, and blockchain companies.

In addition to custody storage, trading and liquidity management, asset and wealth management, and transaction banking, the bank has been developing tokenization solutions that “will help clients to issue and manage financial assets on multiple blockchain protocols and connect them to investors in an easy and cost-effective way.” The bank plans to offer the tokenization of fiat, precious metals, as well as alternative assets including real estate, commodities, and art. It will also help companies with security token offerings. “The tokenisation of investment products, real assets, rights and primary financing constitutes another mainstay,” SEBA reiterated.

Other services include e-banking, a wallet app, and a card; they allow customers to manage BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, and XLM, and convert them into traditional investments and vice versa online. The traditional asset classes offered include equities, bonds, and foreign exchange. According to the bank, its card can be used at 42 million points of sale worldwide. “The SEBA card represents an important step towards the mass introduction of cryptocurrencies,” CEO Guido Bühler remarked.

“Detectives from the E-Crime Squad have arrested a man today as part of an investigation into unregistered cryptocurrency transactions.”

Money laundering accusations

The Cairnlea resident is accused of violation of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act of 2006 for providing an unregistered crypto exchange service and the Criminal Code Act 1995 for dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime.

During the arrest, law enforcement found a substantial quantity of cash and false identification documents, which were seized along with a cryptocurrency ATM from a shopping center in Braybrook.

The investigation was initiated by reports of scam activity linked to the ATM provided to the police by AUSTRAC. This collaboration between the two agencies is one of the first actions by the E-Crime Squad that was related to cryptocurrencies.

AUSTRAC’s national manager of intelligence operations, David Hawkins, said that the outcome of the investigation underscores the importance of collaboration between AUSTRAC and law enforcement.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero – the names of digital-based ‘cryptocurrencies’ are being heard more and more frequently. But despite having no physical representation, could these new methods of exchange actually be negatively impacting our planet? It’s a question being asked by researchers at The University of New Mexico, who are investigating the environmental impacts of mining cryptocurrencies.

“What is most striking about this research is that it shows that the health and environmental costs of cryptocurrency mining are substantial; larger perhaps than most people realized.” – Benjamin Jones, UNM researcher and asst. professor of economics.

Key Terms Cryptocurrency

A digital currency or decentralized system of exchange that uses advanced cryptography for security. Blockchain

An immutable time-stamped series record of data that is distributed and managed by cluster of computers. Proof-of-work

The original consensus algorithm in a Blockchain network.

Cryptocurrency is an internet-based form of exchange that exists solely in the digital world. Its allure comes from using a decentralized peer-to-peer network of exchange, produced and recorded by the entire cryptocurrency community. Independent “miners” compete to solve complex computing algorithms that then provides secure cryptographic validation of an exchange. Miners are rewarded in units of the currency. Digital public ledgers are kept for “blocks” of these transactions, which are combined to create what is called the blockchain. According to proponents, cryptocurrencies do not need a third party, or traditional bank, or centralized government control to provide secure validation for transactions. In addition, cryptocurrencies are typically designed to limit production after a point, meaning the total amount in circulation eventually hits a cap. These caps and ledgers are maintained through the systems of users .

But the mechanisms that make these currencies so appealing are also using exorbitant amounts of energy.

In a new paper titled ‘Cryptodamages: Monetary value estimates of the air pollution and human health impacts of cryptocurrency mining’ published in the journal, Energy Research & Social Science, University of New Mexico researchers Andrew Goodkind (asst. professor, Economics), Benjamin Jones (asst. professor, Economics) and Robert Berrens (professor, Economics) estimate the environmental impact of these cryptocurrency mining techniques. Using existing data that assessed energy use on cryptocurrency, and a battery of economic valuation techniques, the three were able to put a monetary figure on the mining practices.

UNM researchers Jones, Goodkind & Berrens

“Our expertise is in estimating the monetary damages, due to health and environmental impacts, of different economics activities and sectors,” Berrens explained. “For example, it is common for economists to study the impacts from energy use connected to production and consumption patterns in agriculture, or with automobile production and use. In a world confronting climate change, economists can help us understand the impacts connected to different activities and technologies.""

The independent production, or ‘mining’, practices of cryptocurrencies are done using energy-consuming specialized computer hardware and can take place in any geographic location. Large-scale operations, called mining camps, are now congregating around the fastest internet connections and cheapest energy sources – regardless of whether the energy is green or not.

“With each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefit,” the paper states.

The UNM researchers argue that although mining practices create financial value, the electricity consumption is generating “cryptodamages” – a term coined to describe the human health and climate impacts of the digital exchange.

“We looked at climate change from greenhouse gas emissions of electricity production and also the impacts local air pollutants have when they are carried downwind and across local communities,” Goodkind said.

The researchers estimate that in 2018, every $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $.49 in health and climate damages in the United States.

Health and climate damages from producing one coin in the US as a percentage of the value of mining one coin from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Notes: BTC = Bitcoin, ETH = Ethereum, LTC = Litecoin, XMR = Monero.



Their data shows that at one point during 2018, the cost in damages that it took to create Bitcoin matched the value of the exchange itself. Those damages arise from increased pollutants generated from the burning of fossil fuels used to produce energy, such as carbon dioxide, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. Exposure to some of these pollutants has been linked to increased risk of premature death.

“By using large amounts of electricity generated from burning fossil fuels,” Jones said. “Cryptocurrency mining is associated with worse air quality and increased CO2 emissions, which impacts communities and families all across the country, including here in New Mexico.”

In addition to the human health impacts from increased pollutants, the trio looked at the climate change implications and how the current system of mining encourages high energy use.

""An important issue is the production process employed in the blockchain for securing new blocks of encrypted transactions,” Berrens explained. “Along with supply rules for new units of a currency, some production processes, like the predominate Proof-of Work (POW) scheme used in Bitcoin, require ever increasing computing power and energy use in the winner-take-all competition to solve complex algorithms, and secure new blocks in the chain.”

Although relatively limited in overall use currently, there are cryptocurrencies with alternative production schemes which require significantly less energy use. The researchers hope by publicizing the health and climate impacts of such schemes, they will encourage alternative methods of mining.

“The ability to locate cryptomining almost anywhere (i.e. following the cheapest, under-regulated electricity source) …creates significant challenges to implementing regulation,” the paper says.

Goodkind says the specialized machines used for mining also have to kept cool, so they won’t overheat while computing such complex algorithms. That additional energy-use was not part of this study, which means even more energy is being consumed than is currently being accounted for when looking solely at the usage of running the machines.

Moving forward, the challenging public policy question is: “How can you make the people who are creating the damage pay for the cost, so that it is considered in the decision in how to mine cryptocurrencies,” Goodkind concluded.",

After the huge Bitcoin pump we saw in late October, where the price of BTC increased over 40% in the space of 24 hours, it seems the market has now stabilised.

I personally expect the positive trend to continue this week following the recent news that President Xi Jinping wants China to be a key player in the blockchain space.

It’s notable that following Xi’s comments, there was a massive surge in searches for “blockchain” and “Bitcoin” on WeChat.

In addition, the endorsement for blockchain may kick-start a wave of adoption by the Chinese, especially by businesses, just as the brand new government-backed cryptocurrency is getting ready to launch.

Let’s take a look at the current state of the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D)

Bitcoin’s market dominance is now close to 68% after dropping slightly from 70% since late October.

This was to be expected given there are a lot of altcoin speculators and investors in Asia who saw the China blockchain news as a huge boost. After the initial spike in BTC/USD, we see there’s a sudden move from Bitcoin into altcoins as the market stabilised.

I argue that some investors have taken a gamble on altcoins and will soon profit from short-term gains if Bitcoin pumps again.

Let me further my analysis by looking at some of my favourite altcoin/Bitcoin pairs.

Hopefully there’s still a good opportunity to scoop some key cryptocurrencies before the altcoin market pumps massively again.

ETH/BTC

The first thing I notice in the chart above is that ETH/BTC has recovered after dropping below all its EMAs in October. It is now above its 20-day EMA and is trying to consolidate above its 50-day EMA.

With some more fresh cash coming into Ethereum, mainly from Tether and Bitcoin, I expect the altcoin to rise above its 200-day EMA before the end of the year.

Last month, I mentioned how the volume profile on the left shows there’s some support for ETH/BTC just above 1,800,000 sats, which means we could expect to see Ethereum consolidating at this price level. However, ETH seems to be doing even better, accumulating above 2,000,000 sats.

ETH recovered from around 1,600,000 sats in early September to over 2,300,000 sats in mid-October, representing a 31% increase in price.

Shortly after, the Bitcoin market started its recovery and Bitcoin pushed 40% higher versus the US dollar. That pump put downwards pressure on Ethereum, with price falling below 1,950,000 sats.

When the coin finally starts its recovery, there’s strong resistance between 2,000,000 and 2,300,000 sats, where ETH was previously consolidating before the drop last month. Let’s see if ETH holds.

XRP/BTC

Ripple (XRP) is still suffering from a downtrend.

However, even though the coin is trading just below its 20-day EMA, it’s showing signs it wants to start its recovery.

After the massive BTC pump in late October, XRP experienced a 23% drop against Bitcoin that took the altcoin from around 3,700 sats to 3,000. Since then, XRP has recovered to around 3,100 sats, where it’s currently sitting.

Looking at the volume profile, there’s strong support around this level, with weak resistance until around 4,000 sats. If there’s a sudden pump, we could see XRP breaking through its 20-day and 50-day EMAs with relative ease. The next strong resistance levels appear at over 5,000 sats and then again close to 8,500 sats.

For the moment, I expect XRP to consolidate for a short period before a pump towards 4,000 sats.

BCH/BTC

The chart for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently looking bullish in the short term.

BCH has been able to break above both its 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA and is now trading at over 3,200,000 sats, which has not happened since mid-August.

In my last BTC/altcoin market analysis, I mentioned it was important for BCH to break above these two levels in order to consolidate above a key resistance level near 3,000,000 sats.

Looking at the current trend, I expect Bitcoin to pump a few more times before the gains start spreading into key altcoins such as Bitcoin Cash.

Given the above scenario, I believe BCH will continue to consolidate above 3,000,000 sats and will soon break its 200-day EMA at around 3,500,000 sats.

XLM/BTC

At the time of writing, Stellar Lumens (XLM) is trading at around 871 sats after a 14% pump from 750 sats during late October.

XLM is now trading above both its 20-day EMA and 50-day EMA. But XLM hasn’t been pushing as high as some other altcoins. Nonetheless, the altcoin was almost able to break above a key resistance level around 850-900 sats.

If Stellar is able to break above 900 sats and consolidate near its 200-day EMA, I personally believe we’re in for quite a pump.

My end of year expectation is that XLM consolidates above 1,000 sats.

NEO/BTC

As mentioned in my previous BTC/altcoin market analysis, if you are looking for a gem that is outperforming the market, look no further than NEO.

NEO is currently one of the best-performing altcoins versus Bitcoin and is showing positive signs of maintaining its trend. As reported by Coin Rivet, the altcoin pumped 40% versus the US dollar following President Xi’s blockchain announcement.

In addition, NEO has pumped another 15% in the last few days. It is now the best-performing altcoin versus BTC since the October pump.

Looking at the graph above, there are three main reasons why I’m bullish on NEO. The first is that price broke through major resistance levels with ease at around 90,000 and 120,000 sats. The second is that NEO is now trading above all its EMAs. Finally, the altcoin is currently looking to break a major resistance level at around 160,000 sats.

If NEO maintains its uptrend and consolidates near its 200-day EMA, we could see the cryptocurrency breaking above 150,000 sats soon.

But despite having no physical representation, could these new methods of exchange actually be negatively impacting our planet? It's a question being asked by researchers at The University of New Mexico, who are investigating the environmental impacts of mining cryptocurrencies.

""What is most striking about this research is that it shows that the health and environmental costs of cryptocurrency mining are substantial; larger perhaps than most people realized,"" said Benjamin Jones, UNM Researcher and asst. professor of economics.

Cryptocurrency is an internet-based form of exchange that exists solely in the digital world. Its allure comes from using a decentralized peer-to-peer network of exchange, produced and recorded by the entire cryptocurrency community. Independent ""miners"" compete to solve complex computing algorithms that then provides secure cryptographic validation of an exchange. Miners are rewarded in units of the currency. Digital public ledgers are kept for ""blocks"" of these transactions, which are combined to create what is called the blockchain. According to proponents, cryptocurrencies do not need a third party, or traditional bank, or centralized government control to provide secure validation for transactions. In addition, cryptocurrencies are typically designed to limit production after a point, meaning the total amount in circulation eventually hits a cap. These caps and ledgers are maintained through the systems of users .

But the mechanisms that make these currencies so appealing are also using exorbitant amounts of energy.

In a new paper titled 'Cryptodamages: Monetary value estimates of the air pollution and human health impacts of cryptocurrency mining' published in the journal, Energy Research & Social Science, University of New Mexico researchers Andrew Goodkind (asst. professor, Economics), Benjamin Jones (asst. professor, Economics) and Robert Berrens (professor, Economics) estimate the environmental impact of these cryptocurrency mining techniques. Using existing data that assessed energy use on cryptocurrency, and a battery of economic valuation techniques, the three were able to put a monetary figure on the mining practices.

""Our expertise is in estimating the monetary damages, due to health and environmental impacts, of different economics activities and sectors,"" Berrens explained. ""For example, it is common for economists to study the impacts from energy use connected to production and consumption patterns in agriculture, or with automobile production and use. In a world confronting climate change, economists can help us understand the impacts connected to different activities and technologies.""

The independent production, or 'mining', practices of cryptocurrencies are done using energy-consuming specialized computer hardware and can take place in any geographic location. Large-scale operations, called mining camps, are now congregating around the fastest internet connections and cheapest energy sources -- regardless of whether the energy is green or not.

""With each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefit,"" the paper states.

The UNM researchers argue that although mining practices create financial value, the electricity consumption is generating ""cryptodamages"" -- a term coined to describe the human health and climate impacts of the digital exchange.

""We looked at climate change from greenhouse gas emissions of electricity production and also the impacts local air pollutants have when they are carried downwind and across local communities,"" Goodkind said.

The researchers estimate that in 2018, every $1 of Bitcoin value created was responsible for $.49 in health and climate damages in the United States.

Their data shows that at one point during 2018, the cost in damages that it took to create Bitcoin matched the value of the exchange itself. Those damages arise from increased pollutants generated from the burning of fossil fuels used to produce energy, such as carbon dioxide, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. Exposure to some of these pollutants has been linked to increased risk of premature death.

""By using large amounts of electricity generated from burning fossil fuels,"" Jones said. ""Cryptocurrency mining is associated with worse air quality and increased CO2 emissions, which impacts communities and families all across the country, including here in New Mexico.""

In addition to the human health impacts from increased pollutants, the trio looked at the climate change implications and how the current system of mining encourages high energy use.

""An important issue is the production process employed in the blockchain for securing new blocks of encrypted transactions,"" Berrens explained. ""Along with supply rules for new units of a currency, some production processes, like the predominate Proof-of Work (POW) scheme used in Bitcoin, require ever increasing computing power and energy use in the winner-take-all competition to solve complex algorithms, and secure new blocks in the chain.""

Although relatively limited in overall use currently, there are cryptocurrencies with alternative production schemes which require significantly less energy use. The researchers hope by publicizing the health and climate impacts of such schemes, they will encourage alternative methods of mining.

""The ability to locate cryptomining almost anywhere (i.e. following the cheapest, under-regulated electricity source) ...creates significant challenges to implementing regulation,"" the paper says.

Goodkind says the specialized machines used for mining also have to kept cool, so they won't overheat while computing such complex algorithms. That additional energy-use was not part of this study, which means even more energy is being consumed than is currently being accounted for when looking solely at the usage of running the machines.

Moving forward, the challenging public policy question is: ""How can you make the people who are creating the damage pay for the cost, so that it is considered in the decision in how to mine cryptocurrencies,"" Goodkind concluded.",2019-11-19 00:00:00.000,https://bitcoinist.com/tron-will-flip-ethereum-next-year-bitcoin-developer-calls/,"News TRON Will Flip Ethereum Next Year, Udi Wertheimer Calls

Bitcoin developer, known as Udi Wertheimer, recently announced his predictions for the future of Ethereum and Tron, stating his opinion that TRON will overcome Ethereum in about a year or so.

Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and has been one of the most important crypto projects to ever be invented. It brought about the era of second generation blockchains, created the first ecosystem of decentralized applications (DApp), and became the first functional smart contracts platform.

TRON to flip Ethereum in a year

However, along the way, Ethereum saw a number of competitors emerge, and while most of them disappeared as years went by, some did stick around. TRON is today one of the project’s main competitors, and according to Bitcoin developer, Udi Wertheimer, TRON might even flip Ethereum sometime in 2020.

Watching @justinsuntron discussing Tron+Poloniex. Tron is *so* going to flippen Ethereum in the next year or so, it’s not even funny All of the DeFi bois don’t realize it yet, but they’re going to work for Just when he acquires ConsenSys https://t.co/LqgAy1GsPJ — UDI WERTHEIMER (@UDIWERTHEIMER) November 12, 2019

Naturally, this seems like a rather bold claim at first. However, Wertheimer came up with this prediction after listening to TRON CEO and founder, Justin Sun, discuss the new partnership between TRON and Poloniex.

Sun has mentioned many plans for the partnership between his project and the exchange, such as listings of additional assets, and more. However, he also stated that some additional partnerships — which he is not able to discuss just yet — would come in the near future, as well.

TRON:

✅more blocks

✅more transactions

✅fast development

✅business acumen

✅more usecases

✅proven to be censorship resistant so far ETHEREUM:

❌slow

❌inefficient

❌inflexible

❌development hell

❌complete lack of business skills

❌tyrants censoring whatever they dislike — UDI WERTHEIMER (@UDIWERTHEIMER) November 12, 2019

Wertheimer also states that TRON boasts faster development, better censorship resistance and greater transactions, than the largest altcoin.

Can Poloniex be trusted?

Justin Sun is quite well-known for his major announcements and raising hype, which is why many have taken his statements and plans with a grain of salt. In addition, a lot of people do not think much of Poloniex anymore, after the incident from over half a year ago, when Poloniex supposedly took 1800 BTC from its customers and did not pay them back, as some were complaining.

159 days passed from the day Poloniex stole 1800 BTC from its customers and didn't pay it back until now. Do not use Poloniex. This exchange is a ⚠️SCAM⚠️ — nejel (@nejelnejel) November 12, 2019

Others also noted that the exchange is not addressing their issues and that it is not to be trusted, which also implies that its partnership with TRON is equally untrustworthy.

Poloniex, please do something to my ticket submitted ID 2546499. I’ve asked for help for months and yet got any response. — Citichan (@spacecitychan) November 12, 2019

Meanwhile, Sun addressed his followers, encouraging them to use Poloniex and help the exchange expand its business. He praises it as the first exchange that allowed the crypto community to buy coins like ETH or TRX, which is partially a reason why it has his support.

As for the future, Sun has announced that Poloniex will start offering more TRC-10 and TRC-20 coins listed, announcing big things to come. Plans like these are what makes Wertheimer believe that TRON will overcome Ethereum in the next year.

The donation, announced the same day by Grin on Twitter, was made via crypto exchange Coinbase by a donor who expressly wished to remain anonymous, according to a Nov. 11 forum post by Grin dev Daniel Lehnberg.

“Work freely” without dependency

Lehnberg has revealed that he briefly interacted with the donor. While upholding his/her/their desired anonymity, he nonetheless shared some of the donor(s)’ edited remarks, including reported statements such as:

“Our motives are not economical! It’s about the technology and the protocol. Please put it to good use for the development of GRIN. You keep working as you did in the past [...] This is what we are honouring right now with these donations so that you can work freely [...] without economic dependencies.”

Apparently finding the unusual nature of the donation to be not quite enough, some cryptocurrency media outlets responded by confecting the theory that Satoshi Nakomoto — Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor(s) — was behind the donation.

The theory was fed by an apparent Telegram group chat message from Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee revealing that the donated coins were mined in 2010, and transferred from a wallet that had been idle for almost 9 years.

Lee has since confirmed the message was “just a joke.”

Privacy innovations

As previously reported, Grin is a privacy coin that implements scalability- and privacy-focused Mimblewimble protocol — named after a fictional tongue-tying curse from the popular Harry Potter novels.

Mimblewimble is in part a variant of the cryptographic protocol known as Confidential Transactions, which allows for transactions to be obfuscated yet verifiable so as to achieve both heightened privacy and the prevention of double-spending.

This summer, Grin underwent a hard fork — the network’s first since its launch in mid-January of this year — to introduce tweaks to its consensus algorithm in order to achieve greater resistance to ASIC miners.

This October, the Litecoin Foundation published two new draft improvement proposals designed to work toward establishing privacy features for the network by integrating Mimblewimble.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-exchange-ceo-sentenced-to-16-years-in-prison/,"South Korean Exchange CEO Sentenced to 16 Years in Prison

A South Korean district court has sentenced executives of a local crypto exchange to prison. The CEO of the exchange got a 16-year jail sentence while other executives and their accomplices got between six and 11 years. They duped thousands of investors, promising them up to 200% return within weeks.

Hefty Sentences for Crypto Exchange Executives

The Seoul Central District Court has reportedly handed hefty prison sentences to executives of local cryptocurrency exchange Coinup. Judge So Byeong-seok sentenced 53-year-old CEO Kang Seok-jung to 16 years in prison for committing fraud under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment, etc. of Specific Economic Crimes. In addition, the exchange’s CFO was sentenced to 11 years in prison while other executives and their accomplices got between six to nine years each. The executives were arrested in March on suspicion of investment fraud.

Coinup’s executives duped about a thousand investors from August last year to February this year, local media detailed, adding that they collected approximately 450 billion won (~$386 million) from them. Yonhap News described:

They said that the value of the cryptocurrency they pointed to would increase significantly, and they said that if they invested in packaged products, they would pay up to 200% after 4 to 10 weeks.

The Scheme

The executives lured people to invest in an unlisted cryptocurrency, convincing them that its value will skyrocket once it is listed. However, the coin was never listed and investors lost money. Instead, the exchange paid early investors with money collected from those who invested later.

Investigations into the Ponzi scheme revealed that, in order to mislead investors, Kang displayed a fake magazine at the exchange’s office with a photo of him standing next to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The judge explained:

They created a plausible appearance, including a magazine with a photograph of the current president. In light of the consequences, the crime is serious.

However, the judge added that “the victims are also responsible for spreading the damage by investing excessively in the thought of obtaining high profits in a short time.”

The South Korean crypto regulation is undergoing changes. The country’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency, has said that it will tighten oversight of the industry in compliance with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). In June, Yonhap News reported that the number of crypto exchanges in South Korea had been rising, noting that the number of local crypto exchanges stood at 205. The government introduced the real-name system in January last year, effectively banning the use of anonymous bank accounts in crypto transactions in an effort to prevent money laundering and other illegal activities. However, banks have only been providing the real-name account service to the country’s top four crypto exchanges so far.

Democratic Party Representative Je Youn-kyung has proposed a bill to tighten online security rules for all cryptocurrency exchanges, but that bill is still pending in the National Assembly along with a number of other crypto-related bills. Meanwhile, a South Korean presidential committee is pushing for the government to establish the legal status for cryptocurrency for the country to stay competitive globally.

99% of Crypto Assets Are Poor Investments

Bitcoin was the first-ever cryptocurrency, created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, as a way to free the world from the shackles and pitfalls of modern-day finance, where big banks and governments maintain control over the masses and use the control to push their agendas.

With Bitcoin being such a breakthrough in financial technology, many other altcoin assets have since been developed, some attempting to carve out their own niche in the market, while others seek to improve in key areas where Bitcoin struggles – for example, transaction speeds.

The boom in new altcoins really picked up in 2017, during the crypto hype bubble and ICO boom. During that time, thousands of more altcoins were launched on the Ethereum protocol as ERC-20 tokens, with many later moving to their own main net, while others remain on Ethereum even today.

Of the potentially thousands of altcoins on the market, only 4,978 of them are known enough to be listed on cryptocurrency price and exchange data aggregator CoinMarketCap. However, only the top 40 crypto assets listed by volume offer investors enough liquidity to be considered “good investments,” according to crypto analyst Willy Woo.

Liquidity is the most important aspect of any asset, as, without it, orders can be stuck waiting to be filled, slippage can occur, and asset prices can fluctuate wildly during entry or exit, as the analyst points out.

The stablecoin Tether offers traders the most liquidity, followed by Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, then Litecoin, and EOS. Further down the list lies Bitcoin Cash, XRP, Tron, NEO, and Ethereum Classic, followed by Bitcoin SV, Dash, Qtum, Stellar, and more.

Republican Attorney General Dave Yost found then-Treasurer Josh Mandel skirted state law when he launched the OhioCrypto.com website last year for business tax payments.

Yost's legal opinion, issued Nov. 5, found that Atlanta-based BitPay, the state's third-party processor, was functioning as a ""financial transaction device."" That meant a competitive selection process, as well as the sign-off of the state Board of Deposit, was required to hire them. Messages seeking comment were left with Mandel and BitPay.

Treasurer Robert Sprague, a fellow Republican who succeeded Mandel in January, abruptly shut down the site last month after an internal review raised issues.

The deposit board, which he chairs, requested Yost's opinion at that time and now has the power to decide how to proceed.

Sprague said at the time that it's vital for Ohio to explore innovative new technologies, but that they must be ""established in accordance with Ohio law.""

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or a form of digital cash secured by encryption technology. The currency has both excited and worried consumers, economists and governments around the world. It exists not as physical bills or coins but as lines of digitally signed computer code, making it easy to use and not always easy to track, secure and regulate. Records are typically kept on ledgers known as blockchain.

Ohio's program didn't send bitcoins to the state treasury, but rather enlisted BitPay to convert the cryptocurrency payments into U.S. currency.

Dave O'Neil, a spokesman for Yost's office, said the opinion on OhioCrypto.com was advisory in nature, so it would not be appropriate to refer it to law enforcement, despite the finding of a legal violation.

Mandel launched the program in November 2018, just before leaving office. He said at the time that Ohio was the first state to accept tax payments via cryptocurrency and that it would help Ohio become a leader in embracing blockchain technology.

Sprague said in the 10 months that the website operated, fewer than 10 businesses chose to pay their taxes using cryptocurrency. He said he could not provide specifics on those payments, such as their individual or combined dollar amounts, because of confidentiality protections.

A ""financial transaction device"" is defined broadly under Ohio law to include a credit or debit card, an e-check entry, various automated financial transactions, such as internet-initiated or telephone-initiated applications — ""or any other device or method for making an electronic payment or transfer of funds.""

Sprague's office said the three-member deposit board — which also includes Yost and State Auditor Keith Faber — has not yet scheduled its next meeting.

SEBA, the Swiss-based cryptocurrency bank, is now officially operational, The Block reports.

The bank reportedly shared a statement with The Block yesterday that said its Swiss clients can now open accounts with the bank. This goes for corporate businesses, asset managers, and professional private investors.

Launched earlier this year, the bank received its banking license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in August.

SEBA says it’s trying to bridge the gap between traditional and digital assets, whilst maintaining high levels of security. At the moment, the bank supports five cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, BTC Ethereum, Stellar, Litecoin, and Ethereum Classic.

Customers will be able to manage their asset accounts through an app and online banking. According to the statement, users will be able to convert cryptocurrencies into traditional currencies and back again all within these online services.

According to SEBA’s road map, the next phase is to roll out its offering to international customers, before expanding its product offering. However, there are no dates attached to this timeline so there’s no knowing how long either of those developments will take.

It’s a bit of a politically conflicting situation depending on your perspective.

Many cryptocurrency and Bitcoin businesses have struggled to work with traditional banks. Regulatory uncertainty, and Bitcoin‘s checkered past have led banks to tread cautiously when dealing with cryptocurrency businesses.

SEBA’s offering could open a few doors for crypto companies that have so far struggled to get a foothold in the traditional banking system.

However, a bank holding your Bitcoin in custodial storage? While that might prevent you from losing your private key, it comes with a number of obvious sacrifices.

SEBA joins competitor bank Sygnum AG, which received a license from FINMA back in September.

The Attorney General of the U.S. state of Ohio has assessed the state’s crypto program and concluded that it is a legal violation of state law. The state’s former treasurer skirted the law to launch a website that allowed 23 types of tax payments in cryptocurrency ahead of other states.

Also read: US State of Ohio Accepts Bitcoin for 23 Types of Taxes

Ohio’s Crypto Program Violates State Law

The U.S. state of Ohio made headlines last year when it began accepting cryptocurrencies for 23 types of tax payments. The crypto program was launched by former Treasurer Josh Mandel before he left office. He set up the Ohiocrypto.com website, operated by the treasurer, to allow tax payments in cryptocurrencies through Bitpay. In January, Mandel was succeeded by Robert Sprague as the state treasurer.

Last month, an internal review raised some legal issues regarding the Ohiocrypto website and the State Board of Deposit proceeded to request the opinion of Attorney General Dave Yost regarding whether Ohiocrypto.com is a financial transaction device subject to the requirement of R.C. 113.40. Sprague shut down the state’s crypto program pending Yost’s opinion.

After evaluation, Yost wrote a letter to Sprague on Nov. 5 declaring his legal assessment of the situation. Noting that “No other statute gives the treasurer authority to use Ohiocrypto.com to collect state taxes,” Yost wrote:

I conclude that Ohiocrypto.com is a financial transaction device, and that it cannot be

used without first being approved by the Board of Deposit.

This means the treasurer must obtain approval from the State Board of Deposit before using the website to collect state taxes. The deposit board has three members: the treasurer who also serves as the chairman of the board, Auditor of State Keith Faber, and Yost. With the attorney general’s legal opinion, the board will now decide what to do about the program. However, at press time, no meeting has been scheduled to discuss this matter.

The Associated Press reported on Wednesday that “Republican Attorney General Dave Yost found then-Treasurer Josh Mandel skirted state law when he launched the Ohiocrypto.com website last year for business tax payments.” The publication added that Dave O’Neil, a spokesman for Yost’s office, clarified that “the opinion on Ohiocrypto.com was advisory in nature, so it would not be appropriate to refer it to law enforcement, despite the finding of a legal violation.”

Paying Ohio Taxes Via Bitpay

When former Treasurer Mandel launched the crypto program in November last year, he said that Ohio was the first state to accept tax payments via cryptocurrency and that it would help the state become a leader in embracing blockchain technology. However, the program did not take off. Sprague recently revealed that, in the 10 months that the website operated, fewer than 10 businesses chose to pay their taxes using cryptocurrency.

Yost explained in his letter that taxpayers wanting to pay in cryptocurrency on Ohiocrypto.com did not pay the treasury directly and at no point did the state treasury actually hold digital coins. Yost, who became Ohio’s 51st Attorney General in January after serving as the 32nd Auditor of State, detailed:

The former treasurer contracted with a third-party company, Bitpay Inc., to process the payments. The taxpayer paid Bitpay in cryptocurrency. Bitpay settled the payment, converted the payment to U.S. dollars, and then paid the treasurer in U.S. dollars.

He added that Bitpay charged a fee for its service which was passed on to taxpayers, noting that payments were ultimately settled using an automated clearing house process between Bitpay and a bank account maintained by the treasurer.

In a press release on Nov. 13, the organization — which consists of “ordinary, anonymous people from different countries” — said it will donate the money to startups which support the idea of anonymity and specifically operate in such fields as the protection of personal information, tools of anonymity, cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

Fighting the misuse of people’s personal data

The idea behind the donations is to fight the manipulation of people by politics, social media networks and other parties who collect individuals’ personal data, which Unkown Fund says has proved to be an “amazing and frightening” tool.

The project supposedly started on 4chan, an anonymous English-language imageboard, and claims to have the support of hacktivist group Anonymous, which it cites as saying:

“Now the main goal of large corporations is to collect as much information as possible about the personal lives of people, and then use it for their enrichment. And they do a great job of it by making ordinary people get poorer. We are ready to fight for change and protect people.""

The Unknown Fund argues that the deployment of blockchain technology and digital currencies could help protect people’s rights and freedoms, and eventually develop a new environment with a trustworthy monetary system.

Blockchain in personal data protection

Many industry players have questioned blockchain’s ability to ensure personal data protection. Speaking with Cointelegraph in August, Timothy Paolini, a board member at NYU Blockchain, stated:

“Blockchains are built around the principles of decentralization, removing the single point of failure risk (think Equifax servers) and cutting out unnecessary third parties by establishing a more direct, peer-to-peer network. This also maintains your privacy and control of your data from third-party apps as data rests at the protocol instead of the application layer.”

Deirdre K. Mulligan, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information, argued that blockchains do not inherently protect your identity, as they can be manipulated by their architects to be centralized and non-anonymous. Mulligan stated:",,https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-grid-explains-electrical-costs-will-fluctuate-for-bitcoin-miners/,"Iranian Grid Explains Electrical Costs Will Fluctuate for Bitcoin Miners

Throughout the course of 2019, Iran’s government and the country’s energy officials have been creating new guidelines for bitcoin miners setting up data facilities in the oil-rich nation. On Wednesday, Mostafa Rajabi, a spokesperson for Iran’s Energy Ministry, described a new price model for mining operations and prices per kilowatt-hour (kWh) will fluctuate during certain months.

Iran’s Energy Ministry Plans to Pay Anyone Who Exposes Illegal Bitcoin Mining Operations

There’s been a lot of reports over the last year detailing how mining operations have migrated to Iran for cheap electricity. After the initial migration, the Iranian government and the country’s power supplier noticed a lot of energy was being used by crypto mining facilities. Following a government announcement about illegal miners, pictures were shared online that showed bitcoin miners housed inside a mosque.

On November 13, Iran’s Energy Ministry spokesperson Mostafa Rajabi explained the country’s new guidelines for mining operations during an interview with IRIB News. Rajabi told the press that anyone who identifies illegal bitcoin operations to the government will be rewarded. Rajabi emphasized that people who expose these facilities will be paid 20% of the recovery damage stolen from the electrical grid.

Fluctuating Electrical Prices

Iran’s Energy Ministry will also prohibit mining digital assets after the peak hours of consumption surpass a threshold of 300 hours annually. During the interview, Rajabi also noted how much bitcoin miners would be charged using the average price for the export of electricity in Iran. During some points of the year, miners could be charged $0.08 per kWh (9,650 rials) and during the cold months of the year, miners would only be charged $0.04 per kWh. However, during the summer months when electricity is used the most in Iran, electrical prices could quadruple to $0.16 per kWh, Rajabi noted. Rajabi disclosed that the new mining rules were initiated when Iran’s summer electrical demand jumped by 7%.

Last June, Iranian law enforcement officials reportedly confiscated 1,000 bitcoin miners from two facilities. This was followed by a bill that was ratified two months later stating that cryptocurrency mining in Iran would be considered a legitimate business. During Rajabi’s interview, he told IRIB News that Iran will help operations that create their own power plants with government incentives. Mining operations that utilize renewable energy sources would be also rewarded, Rajabi stressed.

The Indian government has added new educational courses teaching cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to the public and law enforcement officers. Amid regulatory uncertainty and banking restrictions, cryptocurrency and blockchain technology remain important topics of study in India.

Also read: Indian Supreme Court Postpones Crypto Case to November, New Date Confirmed

New Course on Crypto and Blockchain

A new course entitled “Introduction to Blockchain Technology and Applications” has been added to Swayam, a learning platform initiated by the Indian government’s Ministry of Human Resource Development. This eight–week, AICTE-approved course for undergraduates is scheduled to run from Feb. 24 to April 17, 2020, with the exam date set for April 25. The course is taught by professor Sandeep Shukla of the Indian Institute of Technology (ITT) Kanpur.

Students will learn the basics of blockchain technology and cryptographic concepts, including hashing and public key cryptosystems. The course will also go over private vs. public blockchains and their use cases, the Bitcoin blockchain specifically, how to mine it, and bitcoin’s use in micropayments. Ethereum, smart contracts, IOTA, mining consensus, Hyperledger, and Corda will also be covered.

“The course is free to enroll and learn from. But if you want a certificate, you have to register and write the proctored exam conducted by us in person at any of the designated exam centers. The exam is optional for a fee of Rs 1000/- (rupees one thousand only),” its information page on Swayam details.

Swayam previously offered a course on the subject of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology entitled “Blockchain Architecture Design and Use Cases” which ran from July 29 to Oct. 18, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. In January next year, the platform will also offer another course called “Cryptography and Network Security” which briefly touches on the subject of bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

Police Officers Also Get New Course

Meanwhile, a new course has been introduced by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy to educate high ranking officers on cryptocurrency. The five-day course entitled “Advance Course on Cyber Crime, Dark Web & Investigation of Cryptocurrencies” is scheduled to take place on Dec. 16-20. The course is for the Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of the rank of Additional Superintendent of Police to Inspector General of Police. It replaces the previously planned two-day course entitled “Investigation of Cases Involving Cryptocurrencies” which was supposed to take place in September but was canceled. The academy explained that “Due to administrative reasons, this course is now merged with a 5 day course on ‘Advance Cyber Crime investigation’ scheduled to be held from 16th to 20th December 2019.”

Among the new course’s objectives are the introduction to “various kinds of cryptocurrencies that are available on the internet,” the “working of the blockchain technology,” and “The legal challenges that are faced by various officers in investigating a crime involving cryptocurrencies and digital wallets.” Another two-day course on “Dark Web & Cryptocurrency” is planned for February next year.

The academy trains IPS officers “who have been selected through an All India based Civil Services Examination,” the institute’s website describes. The IPS cadre is controlled by the Home Ministry of the Government of India and officers of this service can only be appointed and removed by an order of the President of India. “The trained officers will be posted as Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in their respective states under whom the other sub-ranks of [the] police force will be working.”

Earlier this year, a national cyber forensic lab was set up for cryptocurrency to help law enforcement officers as a number of high-profile crimes involving digital coins have emerged. This week, the country’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked its own officer for extorting money from a businessman in a crypto-related case.

According to a press release, the U.S. Department of Justice has charged Eric Meiggs, 21 and Declan Harrington, 20, on counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, computer fraud, abuse and identity theft for allegedly targeting cryptocurrency company executives and other individuals “who likely had significant amounts of cryptocurrency,” as well as those “who had high value or ‘OG’ (slang for ‘Original Gangster’) social media account names.”

The two allegedly sought to steal more than $550,000 in cryptocurrency from 10 different individuals, and apparently secured access to two social media accounts.

The victims were not identified, though the indictment briefly described several of their connections to the crypto space. One victim owned a bitcoin teller machine, while another ran a “blockchain-based business.”

A number of individuals in the cryptocurrency space have fallen victim to SIM swapping, when attackers pose as the owners of a cell phone number, convincing cellular service providers to give them access to the victims’ accounts. By taking control of a cell phone number, attackers are able to log into social media and sometimes crypto exchange accounts, giving them access to users’ holdings and digital presence.

Messari’s Ryan Selkis, Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal and VideoCoin’s Seth Shapiro have all reported facing such issues in recent weeks.

Michael Terpin, a prominent investor in the crypto space, has filed lawsuits after being SIM swapped, taking on both his mobile provider AT&T and the alleged perpetrator. While his case against AT&T is ongoing, he won $75 million in a case against Manhattan resident Nicholas Truglia, 21.

Similarly, Seattle-based Gregg Bennett is suing Bittrex, claiming the exchange failed to act in time to protect against a SIM swap targeting the angel investor.

The DOJ has previously charged another individual, Ohio resident Dawson Bakies, 20, alleging he targeted more than 50 individuals to SIM swap.

According to Thursday’s press release, the FBI and Internal Revenue Service division of Criminal Investigations are investigating the case.

This latest endorsement comes against the backdrop of China’s stringent anti-crypto stance, wherein the country’s lawmakers implemented a blanket ban on its local cryptocurrency exchanges as well as initial coin offerings back in 2017.

The aforementioned Xinhua article takes a balanced approach toward crypto tech, outlining the history of Bitcoin’s development and its overall evolution. It starts off by asking readers the question “Does BTC present the global finance industry with an inevitable trend as far as future currency development goes or is the digital asset just another ‘tulip’ hype?”

The piece then proceeds to describe the core tenets of blockchain and how such a decentralized, immutable and trustless technology can be used to facilitate value transfers in a completely peer-to-peer manner. Additionally, it also covers other relevant aspects related to crypto such as mining, digital scarcity and pseudonymity.

However, similar to most Western media coverage of cryptocurrencies, the piece then starts to devolve into a sweeping tirade of how Bitcoin is mostly being used by criminals and other nefarious individuals to facilitate black market and darknet transactions — a notion that has been debunked several times over in the past. Not only that, but Xinhua’s writing staff also goes on to highlight the volatility of Bitcoin, citing its lack of central backing as being one of its core weaknesses.

The global crypto community weighs in

To better assess the implications of China’s apparent change of heart toward blockchain tech and Bitcoin, Cointelegraph reached out to Matvey Voytov, the chief marketing officer of Waves Enterprise, a private blockchain solution designed to compete with existing DLT platforms. He believes that China is likely to become the most active blockchain market in the world, as it looks to spend $2 billion on projects by 2023. Voytov further added:

“You can’t ignore Bitcoin as being the most successful case of a value transfer system built on blockchain as well as the fact that Chinese investors control a significant part of today’s global bitcoin operations. Still, it doesn’t mean that in the near future China will change its stance on the trading of cryptocurrencies that are not under their control.”

Similarly, Peter Somerville, head of node and developer relations for blockchain platform Elixxir, told Cointelegraph that he too is quite optimistic about the future of crypto and blockchain in China. He pointed out that owing to the country’s massive 1.4 billion strong population, there will always be a huge appetite for real-world crypto and blockchain use cases in the region.

Additionally, he believes that since the Chinese tech community has played a meaningful role in the development of the industry from its very inception, the local market will soon change its mode of operation from a phase of hype and speculation to laying greater emphasis on projects that seek to innovate and build platforms in order to promote general adoption of these technologies.

Lastly, Andre Szykier, the chief technology officer Bitcoin ATM operator Blockchain BTM, told Cointelegraph that with China is seemingly committed to creating a gold-backed security token offering with a stated reserve of 13,000 tons — similar to what Russia has proposed for the ruble.

On the topic of Chinese-owned media outlets appearing to tone down their erstwhile stringent opposition to things like Bitcoin mining and speculative cryptocurrency trading, Szykier made an observation that gambling is a fundamental characteristic of social behavior in China, adding that, “Since the government has gone forward in creating a ‘social score’ to reward or punish behavior in the country, cryptocurrency speculation falls into this area.” Szykier concluded:

“By controlling the buy/sell activity they can identify and control participants. How this affects the top tier individuals with very large wealth is TBD. The future of retail commerce in China is heavily mobile with ease of interchange between various payment systems highly advanced. By making paper/coin payments a smaller part of retailing, the government can monitor their citizens more closely and perhaps impact their social score.”

Has local sentiment toward crypto changed in China?

In order to gauge whether local sentiment toward crypto and blockchain technology in China has actually changed since the 2017 blanket ban came into effect, Cointelegraph reached out to Alex Lam, CEO and co-founder of digital asset services platform RockX.

In his view, the Chinese government’s ban — which, at the time, was in response to an increasing amount of unregulated crypto market activity taking place within the country — ended up bringing digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum to the attention of many who had not heard of them before:

“In my opinion, the 2017 ban led to no big change in people’s perception of cryptocurrency technologies.”

It is no surprise that China, as well as a host of smaller countries, were initially fearful of BTC and blockchain technology for their disruptive potential. However, since China was recently threatened with sanctions and tariffs, the local regime moved to realize that the U.S. dollar and the SWIFT monetary system were being used against it as weapons of war and attrition.

Where is China heading in terms of adoption?

The crypto-friendly media reports are now showing that China is truly working toward its goal of widespread blockchain adoption at a rapid pace, and that the country is gearing up for some big changes in the coming few years following President Xi Jinping’s call for adoption.

To gain further insights on the matter, Cointelegraph asked Max Pertsovskiy, head of growth at Waves, to comment on whether or not he believes blockchain adoption will continue to increase throughout China in the coming few years.

On the subject, he noted that China’s plans have instigated a fire under all potential stakeholders around the globe, as the race for blockchain supremacy is now on:

“I believe that over the next decade, nothing will shape the texture of the global economy as the jostling for leverage between China and the United States will. While there are many benefits to central bank digital currencies, the obvious impetus for CBDC was the Libra. China wants to both increase the international reach of the RMB and prevent the spread of the Libra.”

Similarly, Ben Golub, CEO of cloud storage platform Storj Labs, is also of the belief that China’s apparent change of heart toward crypto-related technologies could be a sign for bigger things to come for the industry as a whole. Golub told Cointelegraph that China is likely to broaden the lead in blockchain relative to the U.S.:",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47120/coinbases-crypto-visa-debit-card-adds-support-for-xrp-and-4-more-coins,,,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47127/anonymous-fund-plans-to-invest-and-donate-75m-in-bitcoin-to-startups-working-on-enhancing-privacy,,,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/19/11/14808063/can-googles-new-quantum-computer-hack-bitcoin,"By Bruce Ng

Ever since Bitcoin was created, the perennial question, asked by skeptics and advocates alike, could be condensed into four simple words:

Can Bitcoin be hacked?

The perennial answer: No, unless, that is, someone, someday achieves a stunning, world-changing breakthrough, creating a computer that’s far faster than any supercomputer in existence today. Nearly everyone agreed that was an extremely remote possibility. But now, some folks fear that day may be closer than expected.

The reason: Google claims to have built a quantum computer.

It’s a computer that’s no longer constrained to just 1s or 0s. Instead, it has bits that exist in multiple states at once, called quantum bits or qubits. It’s a computer that, in theory, could be one billion times faster than today’s fastest computers … that could run 10,000 years of supercomputer calculations in a meager 200 seconds. It’s a technology that, in theory, might ultimately do things which otherwise take millions of years.

In theory.

So, can Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) quantum computer hack Bitcoin? No, not even close!

Google’s breakthrough, no matter how noteworthy, is still very new, very experimental and light-years away from the capabilities needed to hack Bitcoin. Here’s why …

First, Google’s quantum computer merely generates random numbers, like tossing a coin repeatedly. It has no immediate practical applications.

Second, it has only 53 qubits. To crack Bitcoin cryptography, it would need at least 1,500.

Third, it’s not just a matter of quantity. To evolve from 53 to 1,500 qubits will be extremely difficult and will take many years.

Fourth, qubits are highly sensitive. They require supercooled temperatures to operate. They must be stored in enclosed vaults protected from stray dust, vibrations and contaminants. Building a 1,500-qubit quantum computer would be a monstrous undertaking.

“But suppose,” say Bitcoin fearmongers, “that some secret government agency develops a super-quantum computer decades ahead of Google’s. And suppose that computer achieves the 1,500-qubit power that could hack Bitcoin. Then what do we do?”

Our answer: Given the structure of the global tech community today, it’s extremely unlikely any such project exists.

But even if it did, there are several likely scenarios in which the Bitcoin community — and even Bitcoin users themselves — could protect themselves against any quantum-computer attack.

Today, I’ll tell you about two …

Scenario 1

Quantum-Resistant Passwords

An important cryptography mechanism that Bitcoin currently uses is the private key; and it’s the private key that would be the primary attack point for any future quantum computer.

The private key performs a function akin to that of password: Every time you use a Bitcoin wallet or send funds from a Bitcoin address, you deploy your private key, associated with a Bitcoin address that looks something like this:

14EbGbR5rfPgtvs5NQXXH3cgKAGxmKxweW

When you send Bitcoin, the addresses specify the “from” and the “to” of your transmission.

But the current address system is not written in stone.

It CAN be upgraded to a quantum-resistant address system. And to make that happen in a timely manner, Bitcoin enjoys one of the largest community of developers in the world.

Scenario 2

Users Themselves Take Protective Steps

To better understand how would work, let’s look at traditional banking.

You have a bank account with a balance of $20,000. You’re afraid that, when you make your first wire transfer, some bank employees will gain access to the numbers he needs to move your money to his own personal account.

What could you do to protect yourself?

Simple: As soon as you make your first transfer, immediately withdraw all the remaining funds in your account and move it to a new account or to another bank.

That’s similar to what you could do to protect yourself against any future quantum attack on your Bitcoin address.

When you send Bitcoin to someone, your address doesn’t appear on the Bitcoin ledger until you make your first transaction from that address. No one – including quantum attackers — will ever see your address until AFTER first transaction.

So all you have to do is this: As soon as you make your first transaction, simply move your remaining Bitcoin balance to a new address, which is easy to create. Since your new address has never before been used to send Bitcoin, there’s no way anyone, regardless of computer power, can see it — let alone hack it.

Could a quantum attacker see and hack the address in the few minutes between the moment you send the Bitcoin and the moment it’s received on the other end?

Hah! To do so in such a short period of time would require quantum computing that’s so far away in the future, even the few seconds it takes me to write this paragraph is kind of a waste of time.

But I decided to write it for a reason.

For all those folks who also worry about the destiny of our sun, which will burn out a billion years from now … or the destiny of our universe which will expand to the point of a Big Chill.

Let’s worry about such doomsday events some other day.

Federal prosecutors say Eric Meiggs, 21, of Brockton, and Declan Harrington, 20, of Rockport, used cell phone SIM-card swapping and computer hacking to target online accounts of at least 10 individuals with large amounts of cryptocurrency. The victims included the heads of cryptocurrency companies.

The two defendants stole or attempted to steal more than $550,000 in cryptocurrency, according to prosecutors, and gained access into two victims' ""OG"" (original gangster) accounts with social media companies. They were unsuccessful in stealing from some of the victims.

Trump on cryptocurrency and Bitcoin: 'I am not a fan'

Meiggs and Harrington, whose alleged actions spanned multiple years, were charged in an 11-count indictment and arraigned Thursday. Each face one count of conspiracy, eight counts of wire fraud, one count of computer fraud and abuse, and one count of aggravated identity theft.

Cryptocurrency refers to digital currency, including Bitcoin, that does not rely on a central bank but instead transactions from user to user.

Prosecutors allege the two men engaged in ""SIM swapping,"" which occurs when cybercriminals convince a cell phone service provider to reassign the phone number of another individual's SIM card, located inside their phone, to a phone controlled by them.

It allowed them to pose as the victim to request that social media providers send them password-rest links or an authentication code to their newly controlled phone numbers.

In one instance, according to the indictment, the defendants in March 2018 gained access to one victim's Facebook and Gmail accounts. They then sent messages to the victim's contacts, convincing one of them to send $100,000 in cryptocurrency.

Weeks later, the defendants accessed another victim's LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook accounts, as well as accounts at online cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing them to steal $10,000 in cryptocurrency, the indictment says. The defendants contacted the wife of the victim, prosecutors say, and sent a text message to his daughter saying, ""TELL YOUR DAD TO GIVE US BITCOIN.""

In November and December of 2015, prosecutors say Meiggs sent a series of Twitter messages to another victim seeking control of the victim's Instagram account, which was an ""OG"" account name. Prosecutors say Meiggs indicated he knew where the victim lived and sent the address and name of the victim's mother with the message: ""Just give up.""

The indictment does not identify the victims or name their companies. Five are residents of California. Others live in New Jersey, Illinois, Nevada, Michigan and Arizona.

FILE PHOTO: A bitcoin logo is seen at a facility of the Youth and Sports Ministry in Caracas, Venezuela February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello

Part of anti-money laundering regulations, the “travel rule” requires cryptocurrency exchanges to verify their customers’ identities, identify the original parties and beneficiaries of transfers $3,000 or higher, and transmit that information to counterparties if they exist.

“It (travel rule) applies to CVCs (convertible virtual currencies) and we expect that you will comply period,” Blanco said at a conference hosted by Chainalysis, a New York-based blockchain analysis company.

“That’s what our expectation is. You will comply. I don’t know what the shock is. This is nothing new,” he added.

The U.S. government’s moves came as cryptocurrency crime soared into the billions of dollars, with global investigators grappling with major money laundering hubs that are at the center of the virtual worlds. Ciphertrace, in a recent report released in August, said cryptocurrency thefts, scams, and fraud may exceed more than $4.3 billion this year.

The travel rule was first issued by FinCEN in 1996 as part of anti-money laundering standards that applies to all U.S. financial institutions. FinCEN expanded the rule’s coverage in March 2013 to apply to crypto exchanges as well, and in May this year, the Treasury unit affirmed that guidance.

The government’s action comes on the heels of guidelines released in June by the U.S. Treasury led-Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental global organization devoted to battling money laundering and terrorism financing. FATF likewise directed crypto exchanges and regulators around the world to comply with the travel rule, giving them about year to do it from June this year.

“FinCEN...has been conducting examinations that include compliance with the funds’ travel rule since 2014,” Blanco said, adding that it is the most commonly cited violation with regard to money service businesses engaged in virtual currencies.

FinCEN’s May guidance on the travel rule created confusion within the crypto industry, which believes the rule didn’t apply to them.

In an earlier interview, Dave Jevans, chief executive officer of U.S. blockchain forensics company CipherTrace, said people in the crypto industry were surprised at FinCEN’s recent actions because digital currencies have never been classified as money and the belief was that the travel rule does not apply to them.",2019-11-15 17:32:10+00:00,https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-prepare-for-a-significant-move/,"Disclaimer: This article contains technical analysis, which is a methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume.

Despite the high volatility seen across many altcoins, especially those based in China, the rest of the market is holding steady without much action. Some of the most prominent technical analysts in the space, such as Tone Vays, are expecting more downside. The following technical analysis will evaluate whether the top three cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, are indeed bound for a decline.

Bitcoin (BTC)

After surging to nearly $10,500 on Oc. 26, Bitcoin began consolidating between the 61.8 and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level. This consolidation phase led to the formation of a descending parallel channel on BTC’s 4-hour chart. Since then, every time this crypto hits the bottom of the channel, it bounces off to the middle or the top. But, when it hits the top, it falls back to the middle or the bottom.

Bitcoin is now trading around the bottom of the channel threatening to break out in a downward direction. If BTC is able to close below the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level, it would likely move down to the next level of support around $7,900. And, if the selling pressure behind it is strong enough it could even test the 38.2 Fibonacci retracement level, at $7,250.

Nevertheless, a spike in volume that takes BTC to hit the top of the channel and close above it could invalidate the bearish outlook. If this happens, then Bitcoin could push for higher highs considering that the parallel channel on the 4-hour is part of a bull flag.

This type of technical formation is considered a continuation pattern. As Bitcoin surged to nearly $10,500, it formed the flagpole. And, the current consolidation period could be creating the flag. An increase in demand could result in a breakout in the same direction of the previous trend.

By measuring the height of the flagpole, this technical pattern estimates a 25 percent upswing upon the breakout point. If validated, Bitcoin could rise to $11,300.

Ethereum (ETH)

The sudden spike in prices that Ethereum experienced on Oct. 25 increased the odds for the validation of a double bottom pattern. This technical development formed as Ether plunged to $153 on Sept. 26, rose to $198 on Oct. 11, and then retraced again to $153 on Oct. 23. However, ETH’s inability to continue the bullish momentum that it saw in late October could be a reason to believe that the double bottom was invalidated.

Now, this crypto is consolidating within a trading range between $177 and $193.50. This is also where the 61.8 and 65 percent Fibonacci retracement area sits. Closing below this zone would signal a further decline down to $153 while closing above it could indicate a move up to $223.

Based on ETH’s 4-hour chart, the TD sequential is presenting a buy signal in the form of a red nine. This bullish signal estimates a four to sixteen hours correction to the upside. If confirmed, Ethereum could bounce off the $177 support level to test the $193.50 resistance level once again.

However, due to the inability to determine whether this bounce could lead to a breakout, it would be wiser to consider the range between $177 and $193.50 a no-trade zone. Waiting for a breakout of this area poses a lower level of risk than trading within it.

XRP

XRP is contained within the $0.24 support level and the $0.30 resistance level since mid-August. This three months-long consolidation period continues to hold the price of this crypto. At the moment, it is not clear whether XRP would be able to close above or below this area. As a result, this can be considered a no-trade zone due to the high risk that trading within it poses.

Despite the neutral sentiment behind XRP, the TD sequential indicator is presenting a buy signal on its 1-day chart. This technical index estimates that XRP could surge for one to four days or begin a new upward countdown. Therefore, a close above the 100-day moving average could indicate that this cryptocurrency will try to test the $0.30 resistance level, which is also where the 150-day moving average sits.

Moving above this significant resistance cluster would likely take XRP to test the next level of support provided by the 200-day moving average. If the buying pressure behind this crypto is durable enough for it to break through all of these levels of resistance, then a breakout of the no-trade zone would take place.

On one of his latest assessments about XRP, Peter Brandt stated that a diamond bottom pattern could be developing. According to the technical analyst, diamond bottoms are reversal patterns that are not common in traditional markets.

He said:

“The diamond pattern has always been a top pattern among traditional markets. I suppose pattern might work for a bottom in crypto markets.”

Brandt expects that if XRP can close above $0.30, it could shoot up more than 50 percent to $0.47.

Despite Brand’s bullish perspective, it is worth noting that if XRP closes below $0.24, it would likely plunge to $0.20 or $0.17.

Overall sentiment

Based on the technical analysis previously presented, it seems like the top three cryptocurrencies by market cap are sitting at pivotal points in their trends facing low levels of volatility. If Bitcoin closes below $8,500, it could bring the entire market down with it. If so, BTC could be aiming for a retest of the $7,300 support level. If such decline influences the rest of the market, Ethereum would likely plummet to $153 and XRP to $0.24.

Nonetheless, an increase in the buying pressure behind these cryptocurrencies could take them to test their respective resistance levels once again. Bitcoin could go up to $9,300 level, Ethereum to $193.5, and XRP to $0.30. But, if the volume is strong enough, then higher highs would be very likely.",2019-11-15 18:41:12+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/state-run-ukranian-railway-in-lviv-gets-caught-mining-bitcoin,"A branch at Ukrainian Railways (Ukrzaliznytsya), was illegally mining crypto using the power grid of the state.

Ukrzaliznytsya, a state-owned enterprise of rail transport in Ukraine, says that its Lviv Railway unit used its electricity to plug in more than 100 pieces of crypto mining devices to mine Bitcoin (BTC), according to an official announcement on Nov. 15.

The state’s power grid-operating mining farm was reportedly discovered by Ukrzaliznytsia's security department and local prosecutors. As reported by the director of the Department of Economic and Information Security at Ukrzaliznytsia, the farm was organized by officials of the Lviv Railway unit.

Estimated electricity losses in 2019 accounted for around $41K

According to the report, the estimated amount of energy losses caused by the illegal farm has accounted for one million Ukrainian hryvnias ($40,700) in 2019.

As the issuance and circulation of crypto in the territory of Ukraine are banned, criminal proceedings have been initiated for the case, Ukrzaliznytsia stated. Information on the offense was reportedly sent to the Ternopil Police Department of the Main Directorate of the National Police in Ternopil Oblast.

At the time of the inspections, Bitcoin’s price was around 208,000 hryvnias ($8,475), the report notes.

Cryptocurrency mining is not regulated in Ukraine

While cryptocurrency mining is not regulated in Ukraine, the industry has been subject to a number of regulatory investigations to date.

In August 2019, the Security Service of Ukraine arrested power plant operators for mining crypto at a local nuclear power plant facility. Previously, police employees in Ukraine were reportedly caught mining cryptocurrency at work.

Meanwhile, the State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine said in 2018 that it was not planning to regulate cryptocurrency mining.

The news comes amidst an official announcement that Ukrainian authorities will be consulting with major global crypto exchange Binance to establish crypto-related legislation in the country.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bbc-new-files-allegedly-connect-450m-in-lost-bitcoin-to-russian-intelligence,"$450 million worth of lost cryptocurrency from the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange WEX may have been transferred to a fund belonging to Russian intelligence agency the Federal Security Bureau (FSB), according to an investigation by the BBC’s Russian Service published on Nov. 15.

The BBC’s recent investigation into the BTC-e crypto exchange case, in which co-founder Alexander Vinnik stands accused of fraud and laundering as much as $4 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) over the course of six years, has revealed new details which allegedly connect lost customer funds to the FSB.

Demands to hand over crypto assets to the FSB

The BBC retrieved audio files that allegedly connect a person named Anton — supposedly former FSB officer Anton Nemkin — with Aleksey Bilyuchenko, a co-founder of BTC-e, and Konstantin Malofeyev, who was purportedly behind the sale of WEX, a spin-off of troubled BTC-e.

During a business meeting in 2018, Anton allegedly requested that Bilyuchenko hand the cold wallets containing crypto assets of WEX over to him. Following the purported handover, Bilyuchenko was delivered to an FSB department in Moscow, where several plainclothes officers questioned him about WEX operations.

The following day, Anton allegedly demanded that Bilyuchenko passed on all cryptocurrency stored in WEX’s wallets, stating that the assets will be given to the “fund of FSB of Russia.” At the time, the wallets contained $450 million worth cryptocurrency, part of which belonged to the exchange’s customers.

Bilyuchenko eventually agreed to transfer the aforementioned amount. The data from Blockchain.com and Explorer.Litecoin.net indicated that 30,000 BTC and 700,000 Litecoins (LTC) were transferred from the aforementioned wallets — equivalent to $350 million at the time.

Other allegations against associated parties

In July, Dmitri Vasilyev, former CEO of WEX, was arrested in Italy. In April 2019, Vasilyev became the subject of a criminal investigation by the police department in Kazakh city Almaty, as the alleged suspect was charged with defrauding a local investor in the amount of $20,000 through WEX exchange.

That same month, United States prosecutors filed a complaint against BTC-e and Vinnik. Per the filing, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) determined civil penalties for BTC-e and Vinnik last year, who face fines of over $88 million and $12 million, respectively.

The filing stated outright that BTC-e and Vinnik had not attempted to register with FinCEN, implement Anti-Money Laundering practices, or report suspicious activity generally.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-delays-introducing-cryptocurrency-bill/,"Indian Government Delays Introducing Crypto Bill

The Indian government previously told the supreme court that the country’s cryptocurrency bill may be introduced in the Winter session of parliament. However, the crypto bill is not included in the agenda published by Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament. This gives the community a sigh of relief as many have been campaigning to convince the government to reevaluate the bill.

‘Great News’ – Crypto Bill Delayed

The government of India has been deliberating on a draft bill entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019.” The government told the country’s supreme court in August that this bill may be introduced in the Winter session of parliament. However, Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, published the agenda for the Winter session on Thursday which does not include the cryptocurrency bill. Sohail Merchant, CEO of local crypto exchange Pocketbits, remarked on Friday:

Draft bill for banning of crypto is not on the agenda for [the] parliament Winter session. Relief for now, but use this time to come together and present our case to the regulators.

The Winter session starts on Nov. 18 and ends on Dec. 13. Nischal Shetty, CEO of Wazirx crypto exchange, tweeted: “Great news for the crypto ecosystem of India. The draft crypto banning bill will not be included in the upcoming parliament session of November 2019. Great to see [the] Indian government not rushing into this. They’re listening.”

The bill to ban all cryptocurrencies except state-issued ones was drafted by an interministerial committee (IMC) headed by former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg. It was submitted to the Ministry of Finance in February and made public in July. Following the government’s indication that it planned to introduce this bill in the Winter session of parliament, the supreme court postponed hearing all writ petitions relating to the country’s crypto policies to January next year.

Community Forming One Voice

Since the bill was made public, the Indian crypto community has been tirelessly campaigning for the government to reconsider the recommendations, emphasizing that the bill is flawed. Pocketbits’ CEO also urged all stakeholders in the crypto industry to “Forget competition/ego & echo our thoughts with a single voice.”

A number of crypto stakeholders gathered earlier this month at an event called “Unwind With Crypto.” It was hosted by local crypto exchange Coindcx. The exchange described that the goal of the meeting was to “bring all the important stakeholders in the crypto industry together and build a stronger global community.” Noting that “The event was attended by the pioneers of the crypto and the blockchain industry who have taken India’s crypto competence to the global stage,” the exchange revealed that attendees included representatives from Crypto Kanoon, Matic Network, Marlin Protocol, Woodstock Fund, Cashaa, Hard Fork, as well as top exchanges including Wazirx and Delta.

Crypto Kanoon’s Kashif Raza commented, “It is unfortunate that despite our community’s utmost efforts, the central bank still seems confused regarding the widespread power of crypto assets.”

“The members attending committed to having a larger discussion and engage more in the weeks to come,” Coindcx CEO Sumit Gupta told news.Bitcoin.com. “A set of more meetings have been planned to decide the modus operandi. Another event that we are planning is around engaging with the journalists in the finance and business domain to present a fair picture.” Confirming that the next meeting is scheduled for December, he elaborated:

All members present committed time for more such meetings and a lot of backdoor meetings are already underway.

Meanwhile, Shetty has been running a social media campaign calling for positive crypto regulation which he started 379 days ago. Furthermore, the supreme court is scheduled to hear the writ petitions challenging the banking restrictions by the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on Nov. 19.

The momentum was so great that new businesses popped up every second of the day, all hoping to cash in on the first great crypto gold rush.

As 2018 rolled round, the long crypto winter soon froze out the hopes of many. Although the long trough proved too much for some, when prices rose again, the landscape looked very different. Initial coin offerings had largely been declared irrelevant and stablecoins from massive international companies gradually came to dominate a once-diverse industry.

As 2019 staggers into its final stages, crypto prices are volatile but a marked improvement over 2018. With Bitcoin surging over $10,000 on several occasions, the global climate for cryptocurrency projects is improving. China is softening its hardline stance on cryptocurrency and mining, while Blockstack carried out the first token sale approved by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

As the industry regains momentum, companies are once again starting to build enough confidence to aim for public listings on stock exchanges around the world. Cointelegraph looks at some upcoming initial public offerings.

SoftBank’s next bet sets its sights on the Nasdaq

SoftBank is a name synonymous with investment. Unfortunately for the Tokyo-headquartered holding company, two of its most famous investments have been far from successful. Most recently, SoftBank had to dish out a rescue package to the property company WeWork after its disastrous IPO bid fell apart. The company’s other investment, Uber, has seen a 40% drop in share price since the ride-hailing app went public in May of this year.

Nonetheless, another of SoftBank’s investments is gearing up to go public in the U.S. The blockchain and AI fintech arm of the Chinese insurance titan Ping An, OneConnect, filed for a $100 million IPO with the U.S. SEC. The firm is aiming to list on either the Nasdaq Global Market or New York Stock Exchange if its application is approved.

Like many other Chinese crypto-related companies, OneConnect has previously considered a listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, with one source claiming that the firm sought to raise up to $1 billion.

Regulators have been known to take umbrage with poor financial results from applying companies. OneConnect’s IPO filing to the SEC reveals that the company reported at net loss of $147 million on a revenue of $218 million as of Sept. 30, which places doubt on the success of the filing.

Silvergate takes gold

Silvergate Bank has long been a favorite for crypto enthusiasts. The bank, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 7, is famous for its pro-crypto stance. The public listing marks a milestone on the road toward greater integration between cryptocurrency and wider mainstream finance.

Related: What Are Crypto Banks and How Do They Work?

The bank is notable for its Silvergate Exchange Network, or SEN, a system of crypto exchanges and investors that facilitates the transactions of U.S. dollars between members, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The network had a high-profile boost after the Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange Gemini joined in August 2019.

According to a filing made by Silvergate to the SEC, the SEN registered $10.5 billion in transfers for the three months ending on Sept. 30. Total transfers under the purview of the SEC in the same period reached $23.1 billion, with total fiat transfers including wires coming in reported to be at $41.5 billion. The 2019 volumes represent a significant improvement on the figures from a year ago, amounting to $4.4 billion transfers in U.S. dollars in 2018.

The company announced that it would price its IPO consisting of 3,333,333 shares of its Class A common stock at $12.00 per share on Nov. 6. Since the second quarter of 2019, the company reported an increase in crypto-related clients, from 655 as at June 30 to 756 on Sept. 30. Live trading began on Nov. 7 at $12.75, jumping 6.2% over its IPO price of $12.

Mining giants look to hit new seam of investors

While the “Big Four” of tech may now take up most of the headlines in crypto news, before the crypto winter, the same role largely taken up by mining companies. In particular, a position occupied in the tussle between the two titans of mining, Bitmain and Canaan Creative.

The two companies played a central role in transforming the industry from a niche hobby for crypto enthusiasts to a multibillion dollar one. The IPOs of the two mining companies not only represents an important opportunity to assess the democracy that so many commentators in the crypto world believe is inherent to the technology, but also a litmus test for the industry as a whole.

Related: Regulatory Overview of Crypto Mining in Different Countries

It’s not surprising that mining companies are looking to go public now. With both Canaan and Bitmain based primarily in China, the government crackdown on both crypto and mining, and with the vertiginous plunge in prices proving to be a highly damaging combination.

However, with the thaw of both the crypto winter and the Chinese government’s frosty approach to crypto-related business, it appears the two companies want to strike while the iron is still red hot.

Ramak J. Sedigh, CEO of Plouton Mining, told Cointelegraph that while both mining giants will have to make some fundamental changes in order to meet industry standards, a successful listing would be a huge step forward for cryptocurrency as a whole:

“Bitmain and Canaan will need to make deep adjustments to their corporate culture. Neither firm is known for its transparency or post-industrial style corporate governance. Regardless, the industry is watching and cheering for them to succeed.""

Canaan needs to get creative to convince regulators about its results

Although it has long-played second fiddle to Bitmain in terms of its market share, Canaan Creative appears to be leading the charge for a public listing. Despite some shaky financial results, the company initially announced that it would aim to raise $400 million, according to an IPO filed with the SEC on Oct. 28. However, prominent Crypto Twitter commentator and founding partner of Primitive Crypto, Dovey Wan, tweeted that Canaan updated its IPO file, slashing the expected fundraising total to $100 million.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the firm reportedly filed a $200 million IPO request with regulators in July. While Canaan might well be the first to go public, it has some skeletons in its closet that could spook investors. Perhaps the most noteworthy is that this will be the third IPO attempt for the mining firm.

Canaan was an early, albeit unsuccessful, adopter of a tactic now seeing increased usage among crypto-related companies: The reverse IPO. Regulators are often rightly suspicious of cryptocurrency companies, and buying already listed companies is seen as a way of sidestepping the fanfare of a direct public offering.

Only last year, Canaan went for a second IPO attempt. This time, the company targeted the Hong Kong stock exchange. Despite the hype that surrounded the announcement, regulators were less than impressed with Canaan’s business model, and the listing was ultimately unsuccessful.

The date for Canaan’s IPO is unspecified, but as time rolls on toward the firm’s third attempt, all eyes are on the company’s results. Having been the primary reason for the previous failures, the company has been more transparent in giving an accurate portrayal of its finances. In its amendment submitted to the SEC as part of the IPO registration process, Canaan reported a net profit of $13 million for the third quarter this year.

The company’s 2019 revenue for the first three quarters of the year was just over $134 million, but a slow start to the financial year resulted in a net loss of around $31 million. The company will have its work cut out to convince both regulators and investors alike, considering its 2018 full year net profits amounted to just over $17 million.

Bitmain charges toward IPO despite division

Bitmain has long cast a shadow over the cryptocurrency industry. Its 75% market share of BTC mining gives it enormous influence over both the market and technological innovation.

Regardless of its gargantuan size, Bitmain has struggled financially since the crypto winter and even at the start of this year. Many once-promising companies have boasted huge valuations prior to going public. Bitmain is one of them, announcing a valuation of several billion prior to its failed 2018 IPO on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Regulators were rightly cautious about the company’s secretive financials and the Hong Kong IPO application was allowed to expire.

Nonetheless, the firm discreetly filed an IPO application with the SEC in June. According to a Bloomberg report, the amount raised could be between $300 million to $500 million. The IPO bid comes at a fragile time for the company, with co-founder Micree Zhan ousted from the company in a brutal coup led by co-founder Jihan Wu, allegedly without stakeholder consent.

Although the climate for crypto-related companies in China is improving, Bitmain will still have to answer some uncomfortable questions about its profitability, with Wu admitting to employees in a company-wide email that times had been hard for the company since the crypto winter of 2018.

INX

Silvergate, Bitmain and Canaan are all established names in cryptocurrency and beyond. But IPOs are not confined to the industry’s titans. Gibraltar-registered blockchain and institutional crypto trading startup INX Limited announced that it is aiming to raise between $5 million and $130 million, according to its document filed with the SEC.

In the last two years, ICOs have earned themselves a poor reputation, with an estimated 80% of ICOs in 2018 alone being reported as fraudulent. As tales of fraud and exit scams have abounded, so have the respective crackdowns from the regulatory bodies across the globe.

Registering with the SEC, an authority seen across the world as the benchmark for regulatory approval, signals a desire from INX to distance itself from the mass of unregistered ICOs abounding online.

In an apparent bid to further reassure investors, INX wrote in the filing that it will not complete the sale of any of its native INX tokens until it raises gross offerings of $5 million within one year. The firm is also planning to establish a security token, along with two trading platforms managed by wholly owned subsidiaries.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-crypto-companies-reinventing-the-wallet/,"The Crypto Companies Reinventing the Wallet

You wouldn’t think there was much to improve about cryptocurrency wallets. Save for a few UX improvements here and there, what’s to reinvent? A surprising amount, it turns out. This year has seen a resurgence in wallet investment and innovation, with VCs throwing funds at startups intent on reinventing the humble wallet.

Also read: Bitcoin.com Wallet App Marks Over Five Million Wallets Created

There’s More Than One Way to Make a Wallet

At its core, a cryptocurrency wallet is simply software for aggregating public keys you possess and signing transactions with their corresponding private keys. The software is merely the lipstick applied to make this process more pleasurable. And yet, much like lipstick, wallets come in many colors and flavors, with the industry conjuring new variants every year, each promising to be more secure, seamless, feature-rich and long-lasting than its predecessor.

2019 has witnessed something of a renaissance in wallet development, spawning a diverse array of hardware and software solutions and attracting serious investment. This week, Bitski revealed it had secured $1.8 million in seed funding from VCs including Galaxy Digital and Coinbase Ventures. Its wallet, it promises, is the first to be designed for mainstream adoption, by eliminating the normal barriers to setup. Bitski’s solution requires only an email address and password, and is designed to be integrated into applications by developers.

It’s an ETH-only wallet, and Bitski have yet to find a way for users to fund their accounts within the wallet without using a third party. In other words, there’s work to be done in realizing the startup’s goal of achieving mainstream adoption, but that’s where the seed funding will come into play. Next year, its much-vaunted wallet should look much more consumer-ready.

The Evolution of Mobile Wallets

In terms of mobile wallet development, the dominant trend this year has been multicoinery: existing wallets broadening the number of chains and coins they accommodate. Coin Wallet, for example, has expanded its range of supported cryptocurrencies, which now include BCH, BNB, DASH, and DOGE, as well as ERC20 tokens. A similar trend can be seen with mobile wallets such as the Binance-owned Trust Wallet and Exodus, which also offers a popular desktop client and provides Trezor integration.

While some wallet developers have been intent on reinventing the wheel, and introducing as many features as possible, others have taken the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach. This includes the Bitcoin.com Wallet which has just surpassed 5 million downloads. Rather than succumb to multicoinery, the wallet only supports BCH and BTC, but development has not been at a standstill; rather, it’s focused on enhancing the wallet’s core functionality, including adding the ability to purchase bitcoin with credit card. There are also plans to introduce support for SLP tokens in the near future, so that they can be managed directly within the wallet.

Multisig Wallets Keep Multiplying

Another subset of wallet design that’s seen significant attention this year is multisig, primarily for BTC. The ability to enable X-of-Y multi-signature spending has been available with bitcoin for years, but it’s not been easy for laypersons to set up and manage, leading to low adoption of multisig. As wallet developers have turned their attention to improving the user-friendliness and speed of setup for multisig wallets, however, significant leaps have been made.

Casa has expanded its suite of multisig services to include a 3-of-6 known as Casa Covenant that serves as a digital inheritance tool. The company explains: “This [sixth] key is activated after clients start the inheritance planning process with Casa, and it’s held by a client’s estate lawyer. In a scenario where the client passes away, the following keys can be used for fund recovery: Estate lawyer key. Casa Recovery Key.Safety Deposit Box Key.”

A more versatile bitcoin multisig is being developed by Unchained Capital. Caravan is a noncustodial multisig which is open source and can be configured to allow multiple users to control a single wallet address. Alternatively, a single user can retain all of the keys required to access the wallet and safely store them in separate places. Caravan can integrate with existing hardware and software wallets, bringing multisig functionality to bitcoiners without the need to abandon their existing wallet solutions.

With new hardware wallets being regularly released, and existing stalwarts such as Coldcard being revamped, the wallet development arms race is showing no signs of abating. Better custody options for cryptocurrency users, making it easier to store, manage, and secure funds, is vital in achieving greater ownership of digital assets and reducing reliance on third parties.

Packed with information, the report provides a surplus of data on the overall state of the cryptocurrency markets, noting that Bitcoin (BTC) still outpacing traditional markets.

Bitcoin gets boring in November but...

November has thus far been rather uneventful if not boring with regards to price action. However, Bitcoin has had an eventful October. Last month started off slow but ended with Bitcoin skyrocketing from $7,300 to $10,500.

Shortly after, the asset quickly fell back down just below $9,000 before the end of the month. Now almost halfway through November, Bitcoin is holding around the $8,500 mark.

But even at current prices, Bitcoin’s gains have still far outpaced traditional markets, which are having a record year. Several data points also reveal increased mainstream Bitcoin trading as well as increased overall transaction activity in the latter part of the month.

Let’s take a closer look at some striking stats demonstrating how Bitcoin is still outperforming the red-hot U.S. stock market despite the bearish sentiment that has been prevalent since June.

1. Bitcoin 150% vs. US stock market 23% YTD returns

Before its dramatic rise to $13,800 in June, Bitcoin sat at $3,400 in February of this year.

Currently, in the $8,000 to $9,000 range, Bitcoin has fallen significantly from its yearly high, although crypto’s leading asset has still outperformed traditional financial benchmarks even at current prices — and traditional markets have had an excellent year.

Blockforce CIO David Martin said the report:

“Bitcoin returned 11.5% for October, compared to mid-2% returns for gold, the S&P 500, and the MSCI All-World Index. The S&P hit new highs to close the month, returning 23% YTD — a favorable return for traditional assets, but one that is dwarfed by bitcoin’s 150% YTD return.”

As demonstrated by Bitcoin’s volatility this year, buying into the digital asset at the wrong time likely led some traders or investors to buy BTC near its yearly highs of almost $14,000. Bitcoin currently sits almost 40% lower than that yearly high.

The coin’s current price, however, is more than double its 2019 low, outpacing traditional markets by a long shot.

Taking the aforementioned into consideration, one might consider dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin exposure as a potential opportunity, in addition to traditional market exposure.

Dollar-cost averaging involves buying a predetermined amount of an asset at a recurring set point, regardless of that asset’s price, over a period of time. This strategy has the potential to provide investors with long-term profits while decreasing the risk associated with volatility.

2. Institutional interest in BTC gains steam in October

Throughout most of October, Bitcoin futures posted little volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), Martin said, adding:

“CME Bitcoin futures volume was non-existent for the first three weeks of the month but increased during the last week of October given the dominant news cycle regarding Facebook and China. CME contract volume was under $200M for the month, the lowest since Jan 2018, but open interest remained relatively healthy.”

After Bitcoin’s significant price tumble below $8,000 near the end of September, the asset consolidated with overall rangebound activity and limited action for most of October. Bitcoin dropped to $7,300 on Oct. 23 before bouncing all the way up to $10,500 three days later — a historic rally of more than 40% in one day.

During this time, speculations arose regarding various causes for such a pump, including China’s President Xi Jinping speaking positively on Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology. Facebook also headlined numerous articles due to numerous governments’ backlash against its Libra asset concept.

As Martin noted, CME Bitcoin futures volume rose near the end of October. Naturally, this occurred around the same time Bitcoin’s market price rose significantly.

Bitcoin trading activity on the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt platform revealed the same conclusion — that mainstream Bitcoin trading activity increases significantly when Bitcoin’s market price makes major moves.

Martin said:

“Bakkt Bitcoin futures got off to a slow start last month, but both volume and open interest continue to grow. Open interest closed the month at a high of $900k on October 31.”

Additionally, citing a Grayscale report, Martin added that Grayscale’s mainstream cryptocurrency products have seen increased interest, with $255 million invested in its offerings.

“Grayscale has been a dominant force in with their ‘not an ETF’ trust, and saw record quarterly inflows during the third quarter,” Martin noted.

3. Bitcoin transaction volume recovering

Prices for the overall crypto market surged back in May and June 2019, so naturally, the blockchain networks associated with those assets also saw significant traffic.

Daily Ethereum (ETH) transactions hit the seven-figure mark in June, which the market had not seen in more than a year, according to a Cointelegraph report. Since June, however, Bitcoin and Ethereum tallied decreasing transaction numbers until October posted a slight turnaround, Martin reported.

“Network transactions continue to be a healthy barometer of interest in cryptocurrency, and both Bitcoin and Ethereum saw an uptick in October, increasing 1.3% and 2.5%, respectively.”

As Cointelegraph also reported earlier this month, some key on-chain metrics are also suggesting that investors are currently accumulating BTC in anticipation of the halving taking place next May.

4. More mining power is entering Bitcoin’s network

October saw a 7.5% rally in Bitcoin’s hash rate. Essentially, this means increasing computing power and security of the Bitcoin network.

Increased network hash rate (net hash) sometimes means more miners are mining Bitcoin, although it more broadly states that Bitcoin’s network is receiving more mining power in general.

This means new miners, as well as existing miners, are directing more computing power toward Bitcoin’s network, crypto trader, miner and Twitter personality Socal Crypto explained to Cointelegraph.

Either way, a higher network hash rate for Bitcoin means more miners are investing capital into the network, which suggests that they anticipate the value of BTC to continue rising in the future.

Over the past year, Bitcoin’s rising network hash rate trend appears to have coincided with its upward price trend, according to data from a recent Cointelegraph article.

In the Blockforce report, Martin adds that Bitcoin has posted rising hash rate figures every month since May 2019, “although the month-over-month change is slowing down after posting double-digit growth over the six months.”

In any case, Bitcoin’s hash rate when the price hit nearly $20,000 in late 2017 was around 14,000,000 TH/s. Today, this figure has climbed to over 100,000,000 TH/s, suggesting that the price is yet to catch up, as some analysts believe.

Bitcoin would need to surge past $150,000 per coin to make an exchange-traded fund for the coin feasible, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said, according to Bloomberg.

The estimate requires a 1,670% gain for the popular cryptocurrency. It traded at roughly $8,488 as of 3 p.m. ET Friday.

Large fund launches can bring in $13 billion in first-year interest, and the buzz around cryptocurrencies remains healthy, Lee said.

Lee praised the Securities and Exchange Commission for the crypto-related regulation it's done so far, saying ""institutions aren't going to touch crypto"" until the SEC endorses products like ETFs and other funds.

Bitcoin would need to surge past $150,000 per coin to make an exchange-traded fund for the cryptocurrency work, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said, according to Bloomberg. Such an advance would mark a roughly 1,670% increase from current levels.

Several firms look to ride the hype behind crypto-coins through related ETFs, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has mostly stifled attempts to form such alternative assets. The $200 billion crypto sector enjoyed a moderate recovery from an early-fall trough, but it still has a way to go to meet demand necessary for an ETF, Lee said.

""The SEC needs to punt the ETF until crypto becomes bigger,"" Lee reportedly said at conference in Singapore on Friday, adding that ""demand for an ETF is monstrous.""

Large fund releases can bring in around $13 billion in first-year demand, and the buzz around cryptocurrencies remains healthy, according to Lee. His $150,000 estimate requires a 1,670% gain from bitcoin's current price.

The digital currency traded at $8,488 per coin at 3:00 p.m. ET Friday.

The managing partner praised the SEC's regulation around cryptocurrencies so far. The agency may ""look like an obstacle,"" but it's doing a ""great job"" at keeping investors protected, he said, according to Bloomberg.

""Institutions aren't going to touch crypto if they think the SEC isn't doing a good job,"" Lee reportedly added.

The race is on.

One business day before the much-awaited ICE/Bakkt launch, the CME announced it would be listing bitcoin options in Q1 2020. ICE returned the favor by announcing it would also be launching options contracts but in December this year.

Why are two of the largest exchanges in the world competing so openly for a space that was considered, until recently, as secondary by most industry insiders?

Trending

Almost every week, a new player is announcing its intention to enter the increasingly crowded crypto futures market. Most recently crypto behemoths Binance and Bitfinex launched their own futures products, with varying degrees of success.

This optimism wasn’t always there. The rise of Hong-Kong based BitMEX – home to the most liquid bitcoin contract globally – was for a long time met with skepticism by industry leaders, who dismissed the product as only serving gambling addicts with the use of high leverage.

The crypto futures market really took off in 2018. Volumes increased by a factor of ten compared to 2017 levels – a year widely seen as the peak of the crypto market. Bitcoin futures and other perpetual swap instruments are now trading, on average, 10x more volume than the underlying bitcoin spot market according to data compiled by skew and Bitwise.

(Source: skew.com)

In hindsight, it is relatively simple to explain why. As the market entered a prolonged downturn starting in 2018, market participants looked for ways to profit from, or at least hedge against, the falling prices. The growth in futures markets came from that need to short the market.

The market evolved rapidly from very little two years ago. In Q4 2017, the Financial Times published, in a well-researched article, how shorting the stock of chipmaker Nvidia – the products of which were very popular with cryptocurrency miners – could be one of the most convenient ways to get short exposure to cryptocurrencies.

A crypto anomaly? Not really…

Traditional markets also experienced a “derivatives moment” in response to increased volatility in the market. The seventies were a period of incredible financial turbulence as Richard Nixon abolished the Bretton Woods system in 1971, moving to a fiat monetary system, and allowing all currencies to float. The world subsequently went through the first oil shock in October 1973, sending the price of black gold skyrocketing in what was previously a quiet market.

A few months prior, in 1973, in a (not so) curious twist of events, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes found a simple analytical formula to price options, which won the 1997 Nobel Prize two decades later. The conjunction of those two events is widely seen as having started a glory period in derivatives products across all asset classes.

It wasn’t just a fad. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington estimates banks currently have exposure to more than $200 trillion notional of derivatives. Derivatives have gradually become the place where the majority of interested parties are coming to trade – across all markets.

“We will tame Bitcoin” – Emeritus CME chairman Leo Melamed

Should we believe the prediction from the legendary futures trader?

There has been a consensus view that bitcoin is too volatile to be a medium of exchange – triggering a wave of “stable coin” projects in 2017 and 2018. The inelastic supply function of bitcoin is, by construction, indifferent to demand or supply shocks – making all the adjustment occurring through price and creating volatility as a result. Good logic, but not necessarily true in practice. For instance, this argument is also valid for gold, which is one of the lowest volatility assets around, with an average daily move of 0.6% in 2019 according to data obtained from the Federal Reserve of Saint Louis.

There are a number of factors that contribute to an asset’s volatility. One of them is its market structure. Academics have extensively researched the impact of developing derivatives markets on the volatility of underlying assets and have overwhelmingly concluded that derivatives help to stabilize prices.

This is particularly true for options, as flows are usually dominated by call overwriting (selling calls to overlay an underlying position) as investors are looking to generate extra yield. The income fund launched by LA-based Wave Financial is a first step in that direction within the crypto markets.

Bitcoin’s volatility will decrease structurally as those markets keep growing.

Natural selection

Derivatives rhyme with leverage, which essentially allows you to do more with less. That’s great, but only to a certain extent. As Warren Buffet famously said, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction and require careful risk management.

Regulators have as a result been working on curbing the use of leverage globally. In May 2019, Japan’s FSA asked bitFlyer to reduce leverage for its perpetual swap product. The UK FCA is taking even more drastic action by planning to ban the offering of crypto derivatives to retail investors. The regulator also asks retail brokers to warn their customers of the risks of investing using derivatives products, across all asset classes.

“CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 72% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.” – Welcome message on a popular retail brokerage platform

If 72% of investors lose money trading CFDs on low volatility underlyings, what could go wrong trading 100x levered products on the infamously volatile bitcoin?

It is likely that, over time, regulators or simply Darwinism will increasingly put the derivatives market in the hands of professionals.

Not only about volumes

Most participants – including us at skew. – spend probably too much time worrying about volumes. Derivatives volumes are mostly a function of leverage. When Japan’s FSA asked bitFlyer to reduce the maximum available leverage from 15x to 4x on the 28th of May, its volumes declined overnight by at least 50%.

(Source: skew.com)

Derivatives are zero-sum contracts between two counterparties. Traders and investors have to maintain collateral against those open positions. Leading venue BitMEX asks for a minimum maintenance margin of 0.5% and a minimum initial margin of 1%. The CME on the other hand asks for 37% of initial margin. That means if you would like to open a $1 million long position on BitMEX, you can post as little as $10,000 in collateral versus at least $370,000 at CME.

The total $ amount of bitcoin futures contracts opened – called open interest – at CME currently stands at $150 million contract in comparison with $1.1 billion at BitMEX. Because of margin requirements it is likely there is a similar amount of money “working” to trade Bitcoin derivatives at CME and BitMEX despite the later trading 10x more volumes. The “herd” might be closer than people think.

This is a great setup for the offshore exchanges which are able to make significantly more money from the same amount of capital as they collect their fees from the volumes traded.

An increasingly central question: what is the price of bitcoin?

Victims of their own success, derivatives venues were hit in 2019 with a first-world problem.

As trading occurs on margin, derivatives exchanges have been careful to design a spot price index derived from the price of what were, initially, much larger physical exchanges. The index is used to settle the contracts at expiry, and decide when to initiate margin calls. It was a smart way of preventing manipulation of the then not-so-liquid crypto derivatives contracts.

However, as the derivatives market has grown exponentially, we have now entered a period where the underlying physical exchanges are much smaller than the derivatives exchanges – only 10% of total volumes in aggregate. It has become tempting to try to manipulate the less liquid underlying exchanges to yield some profits trading the derivatives.

This was most visible earlier this year in May when a relatively small-size order on physical exchange Bitstamp triggered a wave of liquidations at BitMEX and took the entire market down.

Exchanges seem to have been increasingly aware of the problem and have been attempting to strengthen their indices – sometimes with unfortunate consequences, as with a recent miscalculation at Deribit costing the exchange $1.3 million.

“There’s a whole ocean of oil under our feet! No one can get at it except for me!” – There Will be Blood’s Daniel Plainview

With the CBOE officially out, expect the competition between CME and ICE to be heating up in 2020 as the two exchanges roll out their options offering.

It would be particularly encouraging to see corporate hedging flows taking off, led by mining companies and supported by physically delivered and options contracts. The Mexican government is said to have spent $1 billion on put options this year to hedge its 2020 oi production. Still some way to go for crypto derivatives.

According to Bloomberg Law on Nov. 15, Fort said that the IRS is collaborating with law enforcement to investigate illicit uses of new technologies like cryptocurrencies, stating:

“We’re looking at those, and the ones that may or may not be connected to bank accounts [...] In other words, if you can walk in, put cash in and get bitcoin out, obviously we’re interested potentially in the person using the kiosk and what the source of the funds is, but also in the operators of the kiosks.”

A widespread service

According to Coin ATM Radar, there are 4,129 Bitcoin ATMs and tellers in the United States that enable users to buy and/or sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for a fee. Bloomberg claims that there is one such machine in every major U.S. city. Fort explained that such services are required to conform to Know Your Customer rules:

“They’re required to abide by the same know-your-customer, anti-money laundering regulations, and we believe some have varying levels of adherence to those regulations.”

As Cointelegraph reported a month ago, Bitcoin ATM firm Bitstop installed one of its machines at the Miami International Airport, suggesting that Bitcoin is useful to move money when traveling.

Tax status remains murky

Fort explained that cryptocurrency taxation issues are an emerging threat, adding that the cryptocurrency space has an inherent lack of transparency and visibility, which increases its potential for non-compliance. Still, he admits that no cases have been filed so far, stating, “We haven’t had any public cases filed, but we do have open cases in inventory.”

Earlier this week, Suzanne Sinno, an attorney in the IRS Office of the Associate Chief Counsel, clarified that cryptocurrencies have never been eligible for like-kind tax exemption, even before the 2017 tax overhaul.

In the U.S., a like-kind exchange — or a 1031 exchange — is an asset transaction that does not generate a tax liability from the sale of an asset when it was sold to acquire a replacement asset.

While crypto traders were mostly aware that post-overhaul transactions do not qualify for such an exemption, transaction eligibility prior to that period had been murky.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-abey-foundation-introduces-new-crypto-enabled-credit-card-technology,"Speaking at BlockShow Asia 2019, aBey Foundation co-founder Dr. Ciprian Pungila announced aPay, a payment system that lets the cryptocurrency community use its assets for daily payments via credit card integrations.

aPay users can send their cryptocurrencies to the platform and gain access to three different credit cards that operate with UnionPay, Mastercard, and Visa. They can therefore use their cryptocurrencies for daily payments.

Based on new blockchain technology developed by the aBey Foundation, aPay promises to be a speedy blockchain that introduces new architecture and high-performance computing that would enable faster transactions. “aBey is designed and built to be among the fastest and most flexible open source chains in the world, providing a practical solution for common e-commerce use cases,” Punglia said.

The co-founder revealed that aPay supports Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Litecoin, Dash, EOS, Ripple, ZCash, and a native cryptocurrency built by aBey. He clarified that aPay does not require the merchant to accept cryptocurrencies. They only need to accept conventional credit card payments, and aPay's solution automatically converts the payment from crypto to fiat.

Dr. Pungila added that it is still not clear how blockchain technology will impact the financial sector, but it is certain that distributed ledger applications will change the technological and financial landscape:

“The financial technology industry has been impacted by the development of blockchain technology, but there is still not much clarity on how it will change our lives. It is certain that there is no turning back, and therefore we must build applications and solutions to accept and develop this change.”

Cryptocurrency traders on Bisq are using Revolut to buy and sell bitcoin without the need for KYC/AML. The decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace allows anyone to buy or sell cryptocurrency via a range of payment processors and traditional banking services. With Localbitcoins now a twisted nightmare of KYC, privacy-conscious traders have few platforms to which they can turn. But in Bisq, they appear to have found a solution of sorts.

Trading Bitcoin Without the Awkward Questions

Unlike services such as Localbitcoins or buy.Bitcoin.com which work in-browser, Bisq requires users to first download the application before buying and selling crypto, with Windows, Mac and Linux systems all supported. A popular method of purchasing BTC on Bisq (formerly Bitsquare) is with Revolut, with many users opting for the virtual banking service on account of its speed and convenience. Although quick and easy at the initial point of use, there are potential pitfalls to relying on Revolut.

As early as last year, Bisq issued a warning regarding the service and its suitability for avoiding unwanted attention. As the Bisq twitter account stated: “Payment methods based on traditional finance systems are going to require KYC at some level, sooner or later. Revolut is not special in this regard.”

It’s not just KYC/AML which poses problems either: a number of users have complained that after repeated transactions on Bisq, Revolut has suspended their accounts, leading to weeks of uncertainty and added complications. Revolut itself, it should be noted, requires KYC in order to obtain an account, and is not an anonymous or pseudonymous service.

most obvious with revolut, there are countless reports of accounts being blocked following a bisq transaction. Our guess is the messages in the transactions doesn't seem normal (who would send some random string as a message?) and some accounts take weeks to get unblocked — nodl (@nodl_it) March 27, 2019

A Little Privacy Please

Since the onboarding process at centralized exchanges and the obligatory intrusion of KYC remains a bone of contention for many, bitcoiners continue to seek out dependable decentralized alternatives. The development team behind Bisq describe it as “pure P2P infrastructure” built on the Tor network and using local wallets with no custodial accounts. Bisq does not require the user to provide a name, email ID, or verification, so it ticks all the boxes for anyone who takes their privacy seriously. The decentralized exchange also offers a large number of fiat currencies with which users can onboard including the US dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro, British pound and Russian rouble. That said, for all its benefits, there are still limitations to using the decentralized exchange, including higher spot prices, which means the platform won’t suit everyone.

Perhaps one of the bigger issues at this time is liquidity, although Bisq is hardly the only decentralized exchange that has struggled in this regard. Trade volumes remain relatively low and the amount of bitcoin a new user can purchase is initially limited to just 0.01 BTC. This increases over time, with accounts maturing after 60 days, but some payment methods retain restrictions in any case. Bank-based payments are limited to 0.25 BTC for instance, while Perfectmoney and Alipay allow purchases of 1 BTC. It’s clear that Bisq are extremely safety conscious and mistrust many of the most popular fiat payment processors, especially those that offer chargeback facilities. Part of their efforts to mitigate ongoing risks include a deposit and arbitration system which adds another layer of security for traders.

Options for traders who have tired of Localbitcoins.com and its kowtowing to onerous compliance regulations are thin on the ground, but there is an outlet for bitcoin cash proponents. Local.Bitcoin.com enables anonymous P2P transactions, providing a private way to buy and sell bitcoin cash. Between it and Bisq, there is at least a mechanism for exercising one’s right to purchase cryptocurrency without enduring the data-breach-waiting-to-happen that is KYC.

I’ll admit to being curious when it comes to Bitcoin Gold. Not as highly publicised as Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV, my knowledge was somewhat limited. I knew that it was one of the more successful Bitcoin forks, but beyond that, not much more.

Luckily, it’s Alejandro’s job to inform people all about BTG. And there’s nothing that he’s as passionate about as pushing its widespread adoption.

BTG is 2! First BTG block, 491407, mined on Nov 12, 2017 (forking from Bitcoin block 491406, mined October 23, 2017.) Still ASIC-resistant! Thanks to everyone in our global Community!

As you can probably tell by the name, Alejandro is Spanish. His English is impeccable, but he tells me he learnt more about the language during his year “studying Chinese” in China than the numerous trips his parents sent him on to the UK.

“I had to communicate with my colleagues,” he says, “and they were all speaking English.”

With a background in internet companies and a keen interest in finance, Alejandro was studying economics when he first found out about Bitcoin in 2015. He then immediately quit and threw himself “100% into Bitcoin”.

He knew right away that he didn’t want to study how fiat worked anymore because there was “no reason” to. “I understood that there was something newer and better,” he says.

Throwing himself 100% into Bitcoin

Despite his parents’ reaction, it was “one of the best ideas” he has ever had. He’d already racked up enough study hours and even had a couple of successful companies going.

“I realised that Bitcoin was my thing because it’s internet and at the same time it’s money, so I entered first as a researcher and then I started trading.”

Alejandro explains that for a person like himself with a background in economics and risk evaluation, it was a “good entry point to understanding the market from the inside”.

The journey from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Gold

If Alejandro was so captivated by Bitcoin, how did he end up being part of a team of developers who decided to fork it? The simple answer? To “fight the Bitmain monopoly”.

He says, “At the beginning of 2017, there were a lot of issues in Bitcoin, a lot of problems, and people talking about forks in Bitcoin. That’s when I began to get involved with the Bitcoin Gold community.”

The community sprung up united by its passion for finding what Alejandro describes as “the best way” to implement Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision of Bitcoin in the whitepaper.

Anti-ASIC mining developers began to meet up in online forums to discuss how to fight the uncheckable power of Bitmain and also “fight against people who were trying to monopolise some points of Bitcoin”.

@bitcoingold is not only people, is a Community. pic.twitter.com/axrOwszo9n — J Alejandro Regojo (@AlejandroRegojo) December 27, 2017

Bitcoin Gold, he explains, started as an experiment, and ended up being developed as a successful project.

“Our idea was to create the most ASIC-resistant version of Bitcoin,” he says, “so at the time we considered that the perfect thing to experiment was to make an algorithm that could take out Bitmain from the mining.” That’s when the team came up with Equihash.

They changed the PoW algorithm from SHA-256 to Equihash, making it impossible for ASIC mining equipment to mine on the Bitcoin Gold blockchain. Instead, Equihash runs on commodity graphics cards, or GPUs, which are easily available to the public.

“It completely prevents any ASICs because it needs more RAM. ASICs are not good with this so they are completely left out.”

Bitcoin Gold was extremely successful, and “hit the market hard because enough people understood the importance of what we were doing – we were a top-five market cap coin”.

But unfortunately, the Bitcoin fork became plagued with problems.

The (many) issues Bitcoin Gold had to face

In fact, even during the initial fork (it had to fork again the next year when Bitmain created new equipment that could mine on Bitcoin Gold), the Bitcoin Gold website went down for around four hours.

Massive DDoS attack on our cloud site. 10M requests per minute. We are working with the providers to ban all the IPs. We will be up soon! — Bitcoin Gold [BTG] (@bitcoingold) October 24, 2017

It was hit by a massive DDoS attack, and its creators were then accused of pre-mine. The team later clarified that this was not a pre-mine, but a post-mine – an endowment to pay developers to keep the network running.

I ask Alejandro about this and a few other unfortunate events. He says, “Everything you can think of happened to us, but the DDoS attack was not the worst. We are not a website, we are a blockchain, and people understood pretty quickly that we fixed it.”

He pauses for a moment before saying, “We released with a clear enemy. At the time, this company was one of the top in the Bitcoin space… We went out publicly with a clear enemy, so, from that, you can understand a lot of things.”

Bitcoin Gold suffered many other attacks which got the coin kicked off of Bittrex, as well as a host of impersonator scams. None of which were the fault of or within the ability of its creators to contain immediately.

“With the impersonator attacks, it’s like a malware,” he says.

“We are open source, as we cannot control who lists us, we also cannot control if bad actors impersonate us. We were a top-five CoinMarketCap coin, so we were in the eyes of a lot of people and also a lot of hackers. But these are all things top coins are dealing with all the time.”

The ethos behind Bitcoin Gold

Bitcoin Gold claims to be ‘for everyone, for everything’. But the main ethos behind it is fair mining.

“Yes, this is the main idea – one CPU, one vote,” says Alejandro. “But there are a lot more things around.”

He points out that unlike Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Gold has never been in competition with Bitcoin. In fact, many of its developers, including himself, work on both.

“Bitcoin Gold is the only one who is not competing with anyone. The idea started as an experiment, we started with six developers and no one was in the same room. We were in Spain, Bulgaria, Houston, New York, China, and Colombia.

“That should show you how decentralised Bitcoin Gold is. We don’t have an office, we don’t meet up, because we don’t need to meet up. We want to develop in the same way as Bitcoin so that if you remove a developer from the system, nothing happens.”

He explains that the whole notion of having a title as a “co-founder” doesn’t sit well with him. It makes the team sound like a company, and Alejandro and his colleagues consider the founder of Bitcoin Gold to be Satoshi Nakamoto. They like to be considered more like a “chain of people” than a “team”.

He and his team are simply trying to implement Bitcoin in the way they feel is truest to the whitepaper.

“I really prefer to think of myself as a co-creator of this version of Bitcoin, not as a founder,” he says.

“Bitcoin Gold is trying to develop with a limited endowment. As more developers and traders are coming, at some point we would like to not be needed – we would like to leave.

“As Bitcoin has no centre point, we would love to be just considered the people who most promoted BTG at the beginning.”

BTG falling from top five to top 40

Now that Bitcoin is considered more and more as “digital gold”, I wonder, does that in any way affect Bitcoin Gold’s branding?

Alejandro laughs, “It’s just a name we decided that sounded good, but we don’t try to make the relationship between Bitcoin and gold.”

Still, I wonder why people don’t know more about Bitcoin Gold or why it fell so low.

“One very important point to make is that we haven’t spent any money on marketing. We never spent any money on exchange listings, never spent any money on media. We like to make people understand this because it was a very big effort.

“Bitcoin Gold has never paid any listing fees or any press, but we are on 100 exchanges and in wallets, and we are on the first page of CMC.

“So when people see the downtrend of BTG in the market, they have to understand that this is the level you can reach if you don’t pay for things… The up and downtrends are completely organic, we are not paying anything and it should be considered.

“We want to work as Bitcoin itself, our idea is that easy. We don’t pay big wages. but we still have people around.

“Bitcoin Gold has paid the same exchange fees, wallet fees, and media as Bitcoin, which is zero.

What Bitcoin Gold aspires to be

“We propose an alternative system to Bitcoin itself. We think about the small blocks, we think about the goal from the beginning.

“For now, our target on the development side is the Lightning Network and a sidechain for issuing tokens, because we want companies to build with the Bitcoin Gold blockchain as they do with Bitcoin. And socially, as with any other crypto, is adoption – we are ambassadors.”

He continues: “We are on 100 exchanges, in wallets, everywhere. The next big thing for us will be to create events in Venezuela and Ghana, to get people to understand how cryptocurrency can be valuable for countries with social and financial pressure.

“Even for people who know nothing about Bitcoin, we want to get them to use it. This is the work of the ambassadors, to engage with the people, to educate and to make sure they understand that they have another system, not only fiat.”

I’m curious to know how Alejandro approaches people who are new to cryptocurrency and whether he speaks about Bitcoin or Bitcoin Gold, or both. He says, “I am a Bitcoin and Bitcoin Gold developer at the same time. I teach them about both.”

And how does he feel about the other altcoins on the market? He welcomes the innovation.

“I am not this kind of Bitcoin maximalist at all. I consider right now the list of CoinMarketCap as a list of the new generation of start-ups. Probably most of them will fail, but many others will succeed, just like regular start-ups.”

Wrapping it up

I could have spoken to Alejandro for hours and hours, and in fact, it was definitely my longest interview in a while.

Unlike so many projects where its founders are tirelessly checking their watches and talking about all the reasons their blockchain is better than Bitcoin, Bitcoin Gold is a parallel, ASIC-resistant version of Bitcoin whose developers also work on the Bitcoin network.

It reminded me very much of the community spirit that existed in the earlier days before projects started fighting each other and people with too much money and influence began dragging the industry down.

Bitcoin Gold is refreshingly simple. Its developers are open-minded and passionate, and they’re gearing up to release plenty more innovations in the near future.",2019-11-16 14:00:18+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/presidential-hopeful-andrew-yang-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry,"Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang has outlined how he plans to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.

Promise to promote legislation on cryptocurrencies

On Nov. 14, Yang, an entrepreneur, lawyer, philanthropist and a Democratic candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election, wrote in a Nov. 14 blog post on the tech industry that cryptocurrencies experience the levels of fraud that they do because of lack of adequate regulations. He said:

“Other countries, which are ahead of us on regulation, are leading in this new marketplace and dictating the rules that we’ll need to follow once we catch up.”

Existing market for crypto, existing problems in big tech

Yang explained that cryptocurrencies and digital assets already compose a great deal of economic activity. The governmental response has lagged. “A national framework for regulating these assets has failed to emerge, with several federal agencies claiming conflicting jurisdictions,” he said.

In his broader plan to regulate the tech industry and protect U.S. citizens from big tech companies “that are prioritizing profits over our well-being,” Yang promises to promote legislation on the crypto asset market space by defining what a token is, when a token is a security, and clarify the tax implications of owning, selling, and trading digital assets, among others.

Taking a stab at Congress for lack of basic knowledge of technology

Yang further pointed out that in order to effectively regulate innovative technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the U.S. government first needs to understand it.

Yang is referring to the Financial Services Committee, who questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for over six hours about the Libra Association and its planned Libra token. Yang said:

“It’s embarrassing to see the ignorance some members of Congress display when talking about technology, and anyone who watched Congress question Mark Zuckerberg is well aware of this. Without a base level of understanding, it’s unreasonable to expect proper regulation of major tech companies, or the drafting of legislation that addresses the critical technological issues that we’ll continue to face in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.”

In August, Yang said that he plans implement blockchain-based mobile voting if he wins the 2020 United States presidential election, believing that American citizens should have the option of voting on a mobile device — with blockchain technology used for verification purposes.",,https://cryptobriefing.com/surging-interest-bitcoin-vs-gold/,"Share this article

The World Gold Council hit back at the high-profile Drop Gold campaign, arguing investors see crypto as risky and speculative. But do the figures support that assertion?

The council released the results of a survey of 18,000 people in India, China, the U.S., Germany, Canada, and Russia designed to provide “valuable insights into what, how, why and where people buy gold… [in] the wider context of retail investment and luxury goods in general.”

The research found that almost half of interviewed retail investors had bought gold at some point in their lives.

Courtesy World Gold Council, Retail investment assets by percentage

More than half of investors trusted gold more than “currencies of countries.” Trust in gold was strongest in India at 75 percent.

Courtesy World Gold Council, Why retail investors trust gold

Over 60 percent of investors trusted gold for its store of value properties. Almost half of the respondents said they would buy gold as an investment in the future. However, that number drops to 34 percent among those aged 18-38. The council concluded that the demographic differential merely shows that younger generations are “less risk-averse and less likely to adopt a long-term approach to investing.”

The council emphasized that 18 to 24-year-olds took a short-term approach to investing. According to the report, they were more likely to say “I don’t really believe in investing for the long term, I want to live for today.”

Highlighting the loyalty of gold investors, the industry’s market development organization found that around 60 percent of investors who had bought gold in the past would do so again. That figure contrasted with findings for cryptocurrencies, stocks, and funds — all at around 40 percent.

Gold vs. Crypto

The World Gold Council is an industry advocacy organization. It has an interest in promoting gold’s value as an investment. Similarly, Grayscale Investments is a “trusted authority on digital currency investing” and has an interest in promoting Bitcoin, as well as the broader crypto market.

Grayscale initiated the Drop Gold campaign in May. The fund manager’s television commercial opens with two provocative questions, “Why did you invest in gold? Are you living in the past?”

The World Gold Council’s study was intended as a response to Grayscale’s Drop Gold campaign. In its full report, the council dismissed cryptocurrencies as a speculative vehicle for the youngest of investors — Gen Z, which the council defines as 18 to 22-year-olds.

“Gen Z’s live-for-today, risk-taking attitude is most evident in their exposure to other investments, rather than in the exclusion of gold, and one asset stands out as featuring more highly in their portfolios than those of older investors: cryptocurrencies. The role cryptocurrencies plays in their portfolio is significantly skewed towards short-term and speculative needs, in contrast to gold which is skewed towards long-term and wealth preservation needs,” the council writes.

A Fair Reflection?

However, the council’s own findings suggest otherwise. Their survey found only 22 percent of Gen Z respondents saw cryptocurrencies as a way to make short-term returns. A mere quarter considered crypto as speculative and high risk. The figures contrast sharply with the characterization of Gen Z’s cryptocurrency investments as “significantly skewed towards short-term and speculative needs.”

Grayscale’s Q3 inflows represented a quarter-over-quarter tripling of interest in managed crypto assets. 84 percent of those inflows came from institutional investors, primarily hedge funds. The June 2018 ING International Survey in Europe, the U.S., and Australia found that well over half of the 15,000 respondents had heard of cryptocurrency. Crypto awareness was highest in Austria at 79 percent and lowest in Belgium at 38 percent.

While the study found that only one in ten respondents had ever owned crypto, roughly a third saw Bitcoin as “the future of investment.” ING’s results also suggest cryptocurrency awareness spanned all generations, finding that “younger age brackets − especially people aged 25-34 or 35-44 − are not much more likely to agree they have heard of cryptocurrency than other age groups.” 60 percent of people aged over 65 had heard of cryptocurrency.

The online Harris Poll, conducted on behalf of Blockchain Capital in April this year, found that “Bitcoin awareness, familiarity, perception, conviction, propensity to purchase and ownership all increased/improved significantly” among Americans since October 2017.

Propensity to own peaked among younger respondents at 42 percent. But it grew among all age groups despite the bearish conditions of the market that preceded the poll. The most telling finding was that more people in every age group were open to the idea of owning Bitcoin than in the bull market conditions of October 2017.

Overall, younger generations are more interested in investing in cryptocurrencies than older generations. But the same is true for most risk-on asset classes. Capital growth has always been more important in an investment portfolio for younger investors, whereas capital preservation is the primary aim for older generations.

The World Gold Council characterized digital gold as risky and speculative. It also described younger investors as being more prepared to take investment risks. But even its own findings fail to support the link between risky investment attitudes and cryptocurrency. At the perceptual level at least, younger generations do not consider crypto assets to be speculative, short-term, or risky.

Cryptocurrencies are favored by a higher percentage of younger investors than older. But as awareness among all age groups and institutional interest both continue to grow — and as young investors age — that imbalance is likely to change.",2019-11-16 16:51:47+00:00

Celsius reached $4.25 billion of cryptocurrency loans since the start of its activity in July 2018 calculated at current Bitcoin (BTC) prices, a 93% increase from the $2.2 billion reported on Aug. 1, 2019.

A fast-growing lending network

The company also claims $450 million in customer deposits and collateral from loans under management, which represents a 50% increase from $300 million on Aug. 1 this year.

Furthermore, Celsius also reveals it paid its users $5 million in interest payments or 66% more than the $3 million paid by Aug. 1. The firm’s CEO Alex Mashinksy said:

“Celsius gives back 80% of loan interest to our depositors with no minimums, caps, fees or penalties — our incredible growth shows there is high demand for lending platforms that put the needs of depositors first.”

The company also claims to have over 50,000 users from over 150 countries and that over 150 institutions are amongst its customers.

A quickly developing but unregulated industry

The latest data shows that the nascent cryptocurrency lending industry is growing rapidly. Additionally, a recently Q3 report released by institutional digital asset lending firm Genesis Capital revealed that the platform added $870 million in new originations during the quarter.

Still, some uncertainties remain as to how crypto lending should be regulated. As Cointelegraph recently reported, global banking regulator Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is currently studying how much capital lenders should hold to cover the risks generated by dealing with cryptocurrencies.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockshow-asia-bitcoin-crash-warning-india-delays-crypto-ban-hodlers-digest-nov-1117,"Coming every Sunday, Hodler’s Digest will help you track every single important news story that happened this week. The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.

Top Stories This Week

BlockShow Asia 2019 was held in Singapore this week, leaving us with plenty of stories to chew over. Binance’s Changpeng Zhao was among the speakers, and he predicted that the central bank digital currency being developed by China will be based on blockchain. Explaining his reasoning, Zhao explained how Beijing wants to push the influence of the renminbi globally in order to make it competitive with the U.S. dollar. He welcomed competition in the crypto world, saying: “Having is better than not having. Having stablecoins is better than not having them. Having Libra is better than not having it.” Zhao’s appearance followed President Xi Jinping’s calls for China to accelerate its adoption of blockchain — and the exchange boss said those who were laughing at blockchain aren’t laughing now.

Crypto regulation was another hot button during the two-day event powered by Cointelegraph. Some, such as Proof of Capital’s managing partner Edith Yeung, publicly criticized American regulators for leaving blockchain-based ventures in the dark — with some exchanges leaving the U.S. altogether because of uncertainty surrounding their status. Others, such as Quoine co-founder Mike Kayamori, were far more cautious. He said regulation was something that needs to be done carefully given how the industry is constantly evolving, and he warned: “The government can’t try to regulate things it still doesn’t understand.”

Another interesting panel at BlockShow focused on creating token value — and asked whether monetary gains are hindering blockchain innovation. VeChain founder Sunny Lu claimed 99% of a token’s value is normally linked to speculation, rather than the value that a solution can bring to society. He added: “This causes many startups to waste a lot of time producing and 'selling' the token, failing to develop solutions for where they were initially focused.” Fellow speakers acknowledged that it can be difficult to determine the value of blockchain projects, given how the blockchain industry is still very young, but they expressed confidence that it will get easier as the market continues to develop.

A quick look at some of this week’s other headlines now. India’s proposed, controversial ban on cryptocurrency is being delayed. The draft bill was expected to be introduced in parliament in the winter session that takes place between Nov. 18 and Dec. 13, but it has not been included in the agenda. Crypto businesses and consumers in the country have expressed concern because the law proposes jail terms of up to 10 years for those found dealing in digital currencies. Indian exchanges have welcomed the delay — urging campaigners to forget competition and ego, and to present their case to regulators in a united fashion. Others have said the delay proves that the government is listening and potentially reevaluating its position.

Konstantin Ignatov, the co-founder of the crypto scam OneCoin, has pleaded guilty to participating in the multibillion-dollar fraud. As part of a plea deal, he admitted a multitude of charges, including money laundering and fraud. He is facing up to 90 years in prison and has yet to be sentenced, but will reportedly face no further criminal charges for his role in OneCoin, except potential tax violations. OneCoin is known as a major crypto exit scam, and the Bulgarian-based firm remains fully operational despite allegations it raised $4.4 billion in a Ponzi scheme.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $8,602.00, Ether at $185.44, and XRP at $0.27. The total market cap is at $235,793,356,657.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are MMOCoin, eosBLACK and Sparkster. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Monoeci, USDX and Bitcoin God.

Speaking at BlockShow Asia 2019, the industry expert said BTC’s position as censorship-resistant money would be undermined if major players begin to embrace it more fully — undermining its value. During his appearance, Kravchenko also said Bitcoin’s price will rise if governments around the world attempt to ban Bitcoin altogether, and that the cryptocurrency must attempt to become more private and introduce anonymizing features if it is going to remain resistant to censorship.

FUD of the Week

A Dutch court has ruled that Facebook must remove BTC-related fraudulent investment ads following a lawsuit by local billionaire John de Mol. The TV executive had launched legal proceedings against the social network earlier this year, alleging that the company had failed to respond to multiple requests to remove ads that used his image without consent. De Mol claimed that vulnerable victims had lost $1.8 million as a result of the campaign. The court rejected Facebook’s assertion that it is “a neutral funnel for information” — and as well as removing any incriminating ads, the company has been told it must provide all available information about the people behind them. For its part, the tech giant insists it has already taken down the ads in question, and it is considering “all legal options including an appeal.”

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is looking into potential tax issues arising from Bitcoin ATMs and kiosks. John Fort, the regulator’s criminal investigation chief, said the IRS is collaborating with law enforcement to look into the illicit use of such machines. He said: “If you can walk in, put cash in and get Bitcoin out, obviously we’re interested potentially in the person using the kiosk and what the source of the funds is, but also in the operators of the kiosks.” This came as the number of BTC ATMs hit a new milestone worldwide, with more than 6,000 now in operation. More than 65% are based in the United States.

David Herr, the chief technical officer of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team, has said that only a small number of fans are using crypto to purchase things such as merchandise and tickets. Herr said Bitcoin was “still complicated to 99% of the population” — and he compared the crypto world to a cottage industry. The Mavericks became the second NBA team to accept BTC back in the middle of August.

Even though a lot of people use it mainly to get exposure to its price denominated in fiat currencies, there are a lot of businesses that accept Bitcoin as a payment method.

Traveling With Bitcoin

Back in 2013, the popular American travel agency Cheapair began accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment. This led to other companies implementing it as well, and now clients can use their bitcoins to book flights and hotels all around the world.

The cryptocurrency can be used to directly book a flight with Norwegian Air that also allowed it as a payment option earlier this year. Interestingly enough, the company is also reportedly looking into creating its cryptocurrency exchange.

People can also use Bitcoin to book certain hotels. For instance, a large Canadian group called Sandman Hotels started accepting BTC back in 2014. More recently, a Swiss luxury hotel, The Dolder Grand, announced that its clients could use the largest cryptocurrency to pay for their accommodation.

Entertainment & Sports

If you are into mind-boggling and adrenaline-boosting experiences, then chances are you have heard about escape rooms. Those real-life puzzle rooms where you have to solve a lot of mysteries and problems to get out of a specific space have become nothing short of accessible. Interestingly enough, there are many escape rooms that accept crypto as a means of payment.

On another note, a close variation of an online library, the Internet Archive, that includes vast loads of information, is also accepting donations in crypto. Some of the most popular ones include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ripple, Zcash.

As CryptoPotato reported earlier this year, cryptocurrency adoption and usage continue with one of the most popular sports in the world – soccer. A famous Portuguese team, S.L. Benfica, allows its fans to use Bitcoin and Ethereum to purchase its merchandise.

Technology

Since Bitcoin’s idea is to be an electronic, peer-to-peer payment method, it’s only logical that online stores are among the first businesses to ever accept it. The tech giant Microsoft added the popular cryptocurrency back in 2014 for some of its products.

Since then, others were quick to follow in these footsteps. Overstock, the popular US-based online retailer, was among the first major stores to accept Bitcoin as a legitimate payment method. Those who want to purchase their electronics with crypto can do so with Newegg as well, which is a tech-focused online store.

The Food Industry

This is where things get a little bit interesting because it’s still somewhat uncommon to pay for your Sushi with Bitcoin. However, there are plenty of venues which would gladly take it. Clients can enjoy their favorite meals from pizzas to burgers while paying with their cryptocurrency assets.

Back in 2010, on May 22nd, a man from Florida called Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC for two large pizzas. This amount is currently worth millions, and it’s perhaps one of the most famous Bitcoin transactions in the relatively short history of the cryptocurrency. Of course, back then Hanyecz paid someone in Bitcoin just to order him two pizzas for his own FIAT but was also a way of spending your Bitcoins.

Whereas most of the information comes from fast-food chains and takeaways, Bitcoin, as a form of payment, has been recently added to other major outlets in the industry. Reports have it that the Amazon-owned Whole Foods are accepting Bitcoin in their stores as of this year.

Automotive Industry

Lambo (from Lamborghini) is a term often used in the cryptocurrency community when describing a possible price surge. The question “When Lambo?” is perhaps one of the most commonly used ones within the community. However, it turns out that Lamborghini dealerships have seen an increased number of transactions involving cryptocurrencies, especially around the 2017 parabolic price boom.

Some venues allow for the most significant cryptocurrency to be used to purchase impressive models from carmakers like Aston Martin and Ferrari. Still, clients can also choose classic cars, as well.

Furthermore, using Bitcoin for car purchases spreads beyond just supercars. Numerous local dealerships, as well as giants in the automotive game, have adopted it as a payment method.

A nascent industry utilizing flared gas to power bitcoin mining units has been developing over the past year or so, in symbiosis with the oil and gas industry in North America. Companies providing services in this promising niche continue to install mobile datacenters at oil wells in the U.S. and Canada, helping producers to save on costs and optimize operations while minting digital coins.

Also read: China Removes Bitcoin Mining From Unwanted Industries List

Crypto Mining Provides Alternative to Gas Flaring

Natural gas obtained during oil extraction is a byproduct well operators working at remote sites have to get rid of at their own expense. It is often burned into the atmosphere as its transportation to remote consumers isn’t cost-effective, if possible at all. Direct venting is not always possible or is limited as the raw gas consists of many harmful compounds and producers have to comply with strict environmental regulations.

Several companies are now offering solutions to oil and gas producers in the United States and its northern neighbor that solve the problem with associated gas in an elegant way, thanks to Bitcoin. They install mobile units equipped with gas-electric generators at oil wells. The excess fuel is used to produce electricity to power the cryptocurrency mining hardware typically installed in modified shipping containers that are easily transported.

Upstream Data, a Canadian company we told you about this summer, is one of the pioneers in the market. It allows oil companies to buy or rent modular datacenters that can be installed at production facilities venting or flaring natural gas. Its Ohmm units are assembled with varying capacities in terms of mining power but they all utilize gas in a very efficient way. Using the free energy to mint digital coins ensures drilling companies receive much higher income from the gas than any market price would return.

Last time, we spoke with Upstream Data founder and CEO Stephen Barbour right after he announced the commissioning of a new Ohmm datacenter in the U.S. state of Texas. He was pretty excited with the expansion of his company’s services. This past Friday Upstream Data tweeted that three of its new Ohmm Mini, 50 kW bitcoin mining datacenters had been recently commissioned in the Canadian province of Alberta:

These beauties conserve the natural gas that would have otherwise been vented, which allowed the producer to turn on the well and increase oil production.

Helping the Oil Industry Meet Gas Venting Regulations

Upstream Data has been developing its creative solutions since 2017, providing an answer to persistent economic and environmental problems that have been dogging the oil industry for decades. Its datacenters need very little infrastructure to utilize the stranded gas; basically only a fuel source and internet connection. They are designed to scale to the available quantity of natural gas and can be operated remotely. Upstream’s projects prove that energy, which would otherwise be wasted, can be harnessed to mine bitcoin.

Stephen Barbour told news.Bitcoin.com that the Alberta producer who installed the Ohmm Mini units had a multi-well production facility closed in due to high venting. Regulations in the province do not allow oil companies to continue production if the vented natural gas volume exceeds a certain limit of 500 m3/day. As a result, the well pad was shut in for approximately a year as the operator had no other way to conserve the vent gas. Building a pipeline network would be too expensive, while flaring is not an option in this case because of the facility’s proximity to local residents, the CEO explained.

The company supplied the three Ohmm Minis powered by gas gensets as part of its “Conservation as a Service” offer to oil and gas businesses. The bitcoin mining datacenters reduced the total vent rate to less than 500 m3/day, allowing the producer to start up the well and begin extraction again. Each Mini is rated for 50 kW, which is enough load to conserve 450 to 500 cubic meters or 18,000 cubic feet of stranded gas daily and is equipped with Antminer S9 mining rigs. The modular units can be easily redeployed to other sites where gas rates are depleting.

Besides the savings and profits from their main activity, oil producers can also earn some additional income in the form of digital cash. Due to this year’s crypto market recovery, bitcoin mining has returned to profitability. What’s more, anyone can start mining, even without having the necessary equipment at their disposal, thanks to services offered by platforms like the Bitcoin.com Pool.

However, Statistica's Global Consumer Survey for 2019 shows that a fifth Turkish residents are acquainted with crypto and have been exposed to it in some form or another. If the figures are true, 20% is the highest proportion of all the countries in the world.

Flying under the radar, Turkey has undoubtedly become a crypto giant, and with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently announcing that testing of the digital lira is to be finalized in 2020, crypto is destined to become even more popular.

In fact, observing the rapid rise of crypto and blockchain in the country, Cointelgraph has unveiled the Turkish edition of the outlet this year. This article was written in association with their team — and in particular, the editor, Erhan Kahraman.

Turkish people were always pro-crypto

While the country’s government was initially reluctant to embrace cryptocurrencies, the people had always found utility in it. A survey from ING conducted in April 2015 found that 45% of Turkish people believed that digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) were the future of online spending. This constituted the highest percentage for all the European countries surveyed, surpassing the European average of 28% by a wide margin.

This higher acceptance of crypto signals that Turkish people more readily use mobile devices for financial activities. The same survey showed that 56% of Turks had used mobile payment apps in contrast with the Eurpoean consumers’ average of 33%.

The online payment sector in Turkey had been ready to adopt crypto, but the first opportunity only came when PayPal was banned in the country following the rejection of its license by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency. The use of crypto in the country spiked to unprecedented levels to fill the online payment space.

Barış Özistek, the chairman of both venture capital fund Boğaziçi Ventures and games publication company Netmarble EMEA, attributed the high adoption of crypto to the advanced gaming market of the country, telling Cointelegraph, “There are more than 30 million active gamers in Turkey. Gaming is a sphere in which virtual equipment and digital currency is used for the first time, and used most commonly.” He went on to add:

“Turkish users already knew that virtual materials increase in value when supply and demand are created in the markets, or depending on their popularity, they may decrease in value. That's why Turkish users adopted to cryptocurrencies very fast and easily. Of course, a high percentage of digitally literate people among Turkish users and being informed about trade in our historical past were contributing factors to the situation.”

Turkey’s crypto adoption is surprising

Back in August 2014, Cointelegraph interviewed the founder of QuazarCoin, who goes by the name Orhan, about the state of crypto in Turkey. At the time, the regulatory environment in the country was not ideal, as the nation had banned Twitter amid rising political uncertainty.

In that interview, Orhan said Turkey was not the best place to develop crypto, not even Bitcoin itself, as the country did not have any frameworks nor the political stability set up to deal with the technology. He added that: “I think this is the reason why people connected to Bitcoin or alternative cryptocurrencies do not want to show their face or their true name to the general public.” These are some harsh criticisms for a country that would become a global leader in crypto adoption just five years after these words were said.

In 2017, the Turkish government made news with another major push back against crypto. The government claimed that Bitcoin was “not compatible” with Islam due to the speculative nature of buying and selling it. However, Ozistek recently told Cointelegraph that he thinks that blockchain and cryptos are pro-Islam, saying, “Instead of being haram, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are more in accord with Islamic Finance rules.” He went on to explain:

“When it comes to cryptocurrencies, if the project gains value, so does the cryptocurrency. You don't earn money from money. If the project you invested in gains value, the cryptocurrency you hold also gains value; if the project fails, your cryptocurrency loses value. It doesn't include a guaranteed income, such as interest.”

Economic uncertainty one of the leading causes of adoption

Turkey’s political situation for the past decade has been rocky. The relationships with its highly distrurbed neighbors, Iraq and Syria, put the country at the heart of one of the most violent international conflicts in recent memory. Additionally, the country's relationship with global superpowers Russia and the United States hasn’t always been great either.

All of these factors came together to make the Turkish lira one of the most volatile national currencies. Volatility wasn’t the only factor that led to the country’s migration toward cryptos. It was the uncertainty associated with the currency, too. Şant Manukyan, the director of international markets at İş Yatırım, told Cointelegraph regarding the issue:

“When compared to other countries which include Argentina or countries with collapsed infrastructure such as Venezuela, the situation of Turkey is much more different, and better. Bitcoin is highlighted in these countries as a protection from devaluation and as a way to carry the money abroad. In Turkey, it provides an alternative to investors who use dollar but look for profit; but it's not as common as other countries for sure.”

July 2016’s failed coup d’état led to a sharp decline in the lira’s price. The lira sinking in August 2018 marked two years of economic uncertainty. Coupled with poor political relations with the U.S. and an impending debt crisis, high inflation and low interest rates, it was a perfect storm for an already tech-ready country to adopt crypto.

The correlation of economically affected countries and high crypto adoption can be seen elsewhere across the global — such as Venezuela, Iran and Zimbabwe — giving credence to the theory of Hyperbitcoinization. Yasin Oral, the CEO and founder of Bitcoin exchange Paribu, told Cointelegraph:

“When a country go through an economic crisis it causes the investors to seek new channels and untroubled markets. In addition to this the fluctuating exchange rate gives way to new investment tools. In Turkey, the crypto money and the other digital assets were accepted as a new means of investment thanks to the population that can easily adapt to new technologies. If you pay attention to the local surveys, crypto money owners plan the digital assets as long term investments as well as actively making transactions.”

Crypto and blockchain

Turkey’s Ministry of Industry and Technology announced plans to establish a national blockchain infrastructure during its Strategy 2023 presentation on Sept. 18 in Ankara. The plan necessitates working with Turkish regulators to assist in creating a regulatory sandbox for blockchain applications. This accompanied several blockchain technology implementations, like the Istanbul Blockchain and Innovation Center, known as BlockchainIST Center.

Talking about the country’s policymakers jumping on the crypto bandwagon early, Ozgur Guneri, the CEO of the BTCTurk exchange, told Cointelegraph that he believes Turkish policymakers are keen to see what blockchain and crypto can bring to the table, adding that:

“The latest major policy decisions were Turkish Central Bank’s aim to launch a crypto currency and Financial Crimes Investigation Board’s decision to loosen its strict stand towards cryptocurrencies. I believe that major motivation behind Turkey’s interest in cryptocurrencies and blockchain is its revolutionary technology and all the potential disruption they may bring to the economy.”

Turkey has a vision of making Istanbul a financial center, and all institutions are working toward that end. Talking about the hard path to make Turkey a global financial hub, Özistek said it will not be an easy task to take that status away from the United Kingdom and Switzerland:",,https://in.reuters.com/article/crypto-currencies-altcoins-dai-idINKBN1XS0OS,"LONDON (Reuters) - Some are backed by dollars. Others by gold. But this “stablecoin” isn’t tied to any major asset - it’s backed by another cryptocurrency.

Stablecoins, such as Facebook’s Libra, are a new breed of cryptocurrencies that aim to escape the wild price swings that make bitcoin unworkable for commerce. They base their value on more stable underlying assets, typically traditional currencies or commodities.

But Dai, in a major divergence from others, uses a volatile digital currency - ethereum - to maintain a steady value.

This might appear to defy common sense, but its advocates say the way it works - with “smart contracts,” blockchain-based covenants with terms set in code - means Dai will always keep a stable value while offering transparency.

Stablecoins like Libra and Tether are in global regulators’ sights, partly because of concerns over how the companies behind them manage the reserves that back them.

Dai, launched in 2017, seeks to dodge such concerns by giving up control of the ethereum coins its value is tied to, locking them instead in the blockchain contracts run by algorithms. That, supporters say, offers the benefits of stablecoins - instant transactions and steady value - while avoiding governance risks.

It is gaining some traction: the Oxfam aid agency is testing it for distributing aid on a Pacific island, while some Argentinian savers desperate to avoid inflation are using it.

How regulators treat Dai could help shape how, and if, cryptocurrencies can evolve from speculative use to a de facto money of the internet. But their response is still unclear.

Reuters is tracking the emergence of contenders to bitcoin - the “altcoins” - as they attract increasing attention from investors, regulators, companies and individuals.

The fourth in the series looks at Dai.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

Like bitcoin, Dai hopes to power a digital economy where people can bypass banks and other financial firms to transact directly with one another. Its workings are complex.

Dai is effectively pegged to the dollar, and backed by ethereum cryptocurrency locked in publicly viewable contracts that are stored on the blockchain.

Many stablecoins are trusted because their value is underpinned by central bank currencies. Users trust Dai, on the other hand, as the ethereum that is locked in the contracts always exceeds the value of Dai in circulation.

When Dai’s value strays too far from the dollar, balancing mechanisms kick in to guide it back.

“With a decentralised stablecoin, you can see everything on the blockchain,” said Rune Christensen, founder of the protocol that Dai runs on, MakerDAO. “Anyone can go and do a real-time audit.”

GRAPHIC: Dai transfers and transactions volumes

WHO’S IN CONTROL, THEN?

Dai is not yet entirely decentralised.

The Cayman Islands-registered Maker Foundation, run from Copenhagen, oversees the technology.

The foundation, also headed by Christensen, develops code and other projects it hopes will allow Dai and MakerDAO to be entirely controlled by its users.

Mariano Conti, head of smart contracts, said he hoped the foundation could cease to exist within two to three years.

“The purpose is to bootstrap the system until it’s no longer needed,” said Conti, who is based in Buenos Aires.

But risks exist in the governance model.

Flaws in smart contracts, for instance, could leave it vulnerable to exploitation and the theft of assets stored on the blockchain, said Timothy Stranex, co-founder of Luno, a crypto exchange in London.

MakerDAO says an “emergency shutdown” mechanism guards against attacks. Should users seek to take over the protocol, it says, the shutdown would be triggered to protect collateral and return funds.

HOW DO REGULATORS SEE IT?

It’s unclear.

Cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins fell outside the scope of a G7 report www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d187.pdf last month that said their ability to keep a steady value in the medium term was questionable.

U.S. regulators declined to comment on Dai.

Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority said it did not use the term “stablecoin,” given stability was purely an aspiration, and that a thorough case-by-case analysis was needed.

Stablecoins like Dai present a new front for regulators as they strive to tame the fast-moving world of cryptocurrencies, experts said.

“The regulators are trying to fit the existing framework onto these new technologies,” said Phil Angeloff, a lawyer at Clifford Chance in Washington who has worked on stablecoins.

HOW’S IT FARED IN THE REAL WORLD?

Better than many cryptocurrencies used mainly for speculation.

Oxfam has tested Dai this year for distributing aid in the Pacific island state of Vanuatu, prone to natural disasters. It gave Dai to around 200 people and 30 vendors on one of Vanuatu’s 80-plus islands, building a mini Dai-based economy.

“It allows us to control more, and interact economically more directly with each other - and more quickly - after a disaster,” said Oxfam’s Sandra Hart, speaking from Vanuatu’s capital Port Vila.

Another larger version of the trial is planned in Vanuatu next year, Hart said, spread across multiple islands.

Dai is also attracting attention in inflation-hit Argentina.

Data is scarce, but a Telegram messaging group for Dai users in the country has doubled in size to over 450 members in recent weeks, the Maker Foundation’s Conti said.

Reuters spoke to five users in cities across the country, who said Dai offered a chance to protect their savings against the peso’s falling value.

“My mom and I started to save a part of our money in Dai,” said Romina Sejas, a law student in the western city of Mendoza.

“We can’t save our money in pesos. Every month we have inflation. We have to be creative to survive to the decisions of our politicians.”

Dai’s decentralisation made it an attractive alternative to other stablecoins, said Jose Villar, a software program manager in Buenos Aires.

“All others, there is some entity behind that can be a bank, and we don’t know who is really behind them.”",2019-11-18 07:45:17+00:00,https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/bank-of-tanzania-warns-against-crypto-currencies-1431046,"By DOROTHY NDALU More by this Author

The Bank of Tanzania (BoT) has once again warned the public to act with extreme caution when trading in crypto currencies investments, saying they are not authorised in the country.

In a statement issued last week, the central bank said it is the sole institution authorised to issue bank notes and coins, and to declare a legal tender in the country.

The bank further said although it has not officially banned crypto currency, it has however, not allowed its use and therefore does not regulate or acknowledge it.

The rise of crypto currencies prices, especially Bitcoin (Btc), the most popular digital currency globally has made them appealing. Others are Ethereum (Eth), Ripple (Xrp), Lite coin (Ltc), Bitcoin Cash (Bch).

The statement further said the bank was also aware of the incidences where these currencies are being marketed and traded with a perception of making them appear as if they were a legal tender in the country.

Benard Dadi, BoT director of national payment system said: “This is an advisory, it is your own risk we don’t stop people to practice for now, but once you are conned there is nowhere to lodge your grievances,” he said, adding that there is no law backing use of crypto currency.

China’s CCTV1, a state-backed social media, ran another story on crypto assets, featuring a 60-minutes exposition with President Xi. But this time, the message was not as enthusiastic as in the past.

China’s Effect on BTC Still Chaotic

China’s stance on Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto, in general, sparked a rally in prices, as well as igniting a mini-altcoin season. Previous comments on the country warming up to crypto lifted BTC as much as 42% to above $10,000 a couple of weeks ago.

Now, the new feature is more critical of digital assets, calling them scams, or unregistered securities. Dovey Wan, co-founder of Primitive Crypto, commented on the recent critical stance of Chinese authorities during the high-profile TV programing.

JUST IN 🤭🤭🤭 Today CCTV1 (CCP official channel) featured another investigative work of “cryptocurrency” on 焦点访谈, which I would considered 60 minutes or even higher profile TV program TL;DR – cryptocurrency is unregistered security, financial fraud and illegal ponzi pic.twitter.com/gLqIjXDsqI — Dovey 以德服人 Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) November 18, 2019

The chief message once again circled around “blockchain, not Bitcoin”, but did not go as far as to call BTC a scam coin. Chinese traders still have access to some of the most active exchanges worldwide, and mining is as strong as ever.

However, the government has shown a consistent stance on smaller projects, including domestic ICOs. China was also the arena for the Plus Token scheme, which took investments from locals and went on to liquidate them through the Huobi exchange.

Wan recently commented that Chinese investors did not see BTC as a store of value similar to gold, but were eager to speculate for higher returns.

Personal Repercussions Feared for Crypto Leaders

But the biggest fear of the government’s stance is not on banning firms and activities. There have been talks of direct personal repercussions for crypto-related personas. Because of the vast and active Chinese social media community, some of the leaders, influencers, and developers, could be personally targeted, warned Wan.

A good buddy of mine is leading all DAI related dev/educational work in in mainland, super solid dude, literally hand held entire Chinese DAI community I’m concerned of his safety being a public face of DAI now, as it’s apparently contrary to what China is promoting 😶😶 … — Dovey 以德服人 Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) November 18, 2019

Even the promotion of DAI stablecoin usage may be seen as a potential risk. At this point, it is uncertain what the Chinese government would have in mind when persecuting lesser coins and projects.

Wan believes China has the power and the potential intention to nationalize crypto assets, including ASIC and other infrastructure. China’s president, Xi Jinping, also stated that the currently vibrant sector may soon be considered criminal activity. Still, China’s government for now excludes crypto mining from the list of illegal activities, and the Bitcoin network is still highly dependent on pools with Chinese-based operations.

The recent critical stance coincided with stagnant BTC prices, at around $8,535.15, down from today’s move above $8,630.

The Mimblewimble privacy technology used by cryptocurrencies such as Beam and Grin is broken. That’s the claim of researcher Ivan Bogatyy who has published a report documenting his findings. In it, he reveals how he was able to deanonymize 96% of all Grin transactions just by running a node at a cost of around $60. Bogatyy asserts that the flaw is fatal, effectively breaking Mimblewimble.

Also read: IRS Dispels Crypto Tax Confusion



Mimblewimble Is ‘Fundamentally Flawed’

“Mimblewimble should no longer be considered a viable alternative to Zcash or Monero when it comes to privacy.” That’s the belief of Ivan Bogatyy after deanonymizing the bulk of all Grin transactions that propagated to his node during a test. A weakness in the Mimblewimble technology, which obfuscates all transactions by default, has long been theorized. Now, Bogatyy professes to have proven this, causing him to recommend that “Mimblewimble should not be relied upon for robust privacy.”

Although the attack does not reveal the amounts being sent, it unveils which addresses are sending funds to other addresses, effectively rendering Mimblewimble obsolete, if a patch cannot be found. Moreover, Bogatyy claims had he been running multiple nodes, he would have been able to record an even higher success rate than the 96% he posted.

How the Attack Works

Cryptocurrencies such as Grin and Beam utilize a number of privacy techniques including Coinjoin, which all transactions are appended to, before being added to a new block, the contents of which cannot be reconstructed at that stage to determine the origin of the inputs and outputs. Bogatyy’s solution is to attack the transactions as they’re broadcast to Coinjoin to be mixed. He explains:

Because transactions are continually being created and broadcasted from separate places, if you run a sniffer node that picks up all transactions before cut-through aggregation is finished, it’s trivial to unwind the CoinJoin. Any sniffer node can just observe the network and take note of the original transactions before they get aggregated.

Grin’s developers were aware of this attack vector when constructing the cryptocurrency and took measures to thwart it through the use of additional privacy tools including Dandelion. This technology conceals the IP address of transactors and thwarts sniffer nodes that attempt to eavesdrop on network activity. But because Dandelion transactions are automatically aggregated by nodes that receive them, prior to entering Coinjoin, Bogatyy found a way to intercept them at this early stage and link them to their original sender.

Through increasing the number of peers his node connects to (the default is eight), the researcher was able to escalate his access, effectively granting him supernode status. This provided unprecedented oversight of Dandelion transactions, and the ability to disaggregate them before they reached Coinjoin. Bogatyy linked 96% of transactions while connected to 200 peers out of a possible 3,000, but points out the ease of connecting to all 3,000 nodes had he spent more on the attack, noting:

The same attack works by launching 3000 separate nodes with unique IPs, each only connected to one peer. As long as I’m sniffing all the transaction data and dumping it into a central master database, the attack works just the same.

Grin developer David Burkett praised the quality of research in Bogatyy’s report, but added: “none of this is “news”. I’m actually surprised only 96% was traceable. There are a number of ways to help break linkability in Grin, but none are implemented and released yet. As I always say, don’t use Grin if you require privacy – it’s not there yet.”

A Sliver of Salvation for Grin

Despite making grim reading for Grin and other Mimblewimble coins, Bogatyy’s report does provide a glimmer of light. He is at pains to point out the other qualities that are inherent to Grin, such as its ability to conceal transaction amounts, though this will be of small comfort to users who were relying on Mimblewimble to obfuscate the path of their transactions. The researcher suggests that Mimblewimble could be combined with another privacy protocol that conceals the transaction graph altogether, but that would be a significant undertaking to implement and is not feasible at this time. This suggestion was echoed by Charlie Lee, whose Litecoin project is looking to introduce Mimblewimble through a collaboration with Beam. Following the publication of this article, several Grin developers have shared their response to the research piece in which they take issue with several of its claims.

As Bogatyy concludes, “it’s clear that Mimblewimble on its own is not strong enough to confer robust privacy.” Grin has fallen 10% since the report was published earlier today, and beam 6%. One small crumb of consolation to Grin’s developers is that the exploit could not have been revealed at a better time: the project has just received a 50 BTC donation to fund its development courtesy of an early bitcoin miner. Thanks to this $420,000 war chest, it has the means to fight back in the hope of engineering a solution.

Do you think Grin’s developers will be able to find a solution to this problem? Let us know in the comments section below.

The U.S. government will strictly enforce the rules on cryptocurrencies similar to the standards recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has reaffirmed that its “Travel” rule applies to cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has flagged stablecoin as a potential risk to the U.S. financial system in a new report.

Fincen Expects Compliance

The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen) will strictly enforce anti-money laundering (AML) rules on cryptocurrencies, Director Kenneth Blanco reportedly said on Friday. Fincen is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury with a mission to combat money laundering and safeguard the country’s financial system from illicit use.

The bureau requires cryptocurrency firms engaged in money service businesses, including crypto exchanges and wallet service providers, to share information about their customers. Specifically, the “Travel” rule requires them to verify their customers’ identities, identify the original parties and beneficiaries of fund transfers that are $3,000 or higher, and transmit that information to counterparties if they exist.

The Travel rule was first issued by Fincen in 1996 as part of the AML standards for all U.S. financial institutions. The rule was expanded in March 2013 to apply to crypto exchanges and reinforced in the crypto guidance issued in May this year. Reuters noted that the May guidance confused some businesses, as they thought the rule did not apply to them. At a conference hosted by blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis on Friday, Blanco was quoted as saying:

It (travel rule) applies to CVCs (convertible virtual currencies) and we expect that you will comply period.

“That’s what our expectation is. You will comply. I don’t know what the shock is. This is nothing new,” he reiterated. The Travel rule is the most common violation for money service businesses engaged in cryptocurrencies, the director revealed, adding that Fincen has been conducting examinations which include ensuring compliance of the Travel rule since 2014.

FATF Standards and the Travel Rule

The AML rules enforced by Fincen are similar to those recommended by the FATF, an inter-governmental policymaking body whose purpose is to establish international standards to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The FATF issued its new guidance for crypto assets and related service providers in June.

At the June G20 leaders’ summit in Japan, the U.S. and other countries reaffirmed their commitments to applying the FATF standards. The G20 finance ministers and central bank governors similarly announced their commitments to implementing them. However, the crypto industry has raised several concerns regarding the challenges in applying the rules, which are not legally binding but countries that refuse to comply risk being put on a blacklist.

Like Fincen, the FATF has recommended crypto asset service providers and regulators worldwide to implement the rules similar to the Travel rule, giving them about a year to do it from June. However, the threshold set by the FATF is $1,000 or 1,000 euros. In October, the FATF revealed that its “assessments will specifically look at how well countries have implemented these measures.” It remains to be seen if Fincen will further update its rules on crypto assets.

Fed Flags Stablecoin as Risk to Financial Stability

Coinciding with Director Blanco’s statement, the U.S. Federal Reserve issued a report Friday following its recent semi-annual financial stability review. The 60-page report has a dedicated section on stablecoin which the Fed has flagged as a potential risk to the country’s financial system.

While acknowledging the benefits of innovation, the Fed believes that “the possibility for a stablecoin payment network to quickly achieve global scale introduces important challenges and risks related to financial stability, monetary policy, safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing, and consumer and investor protection.”

Shortly after Facebook announced its plans for the Libra project, a number of countries raised concerns over the digital currency. Several U.S. lawmakers have tried to shut down the project and some countries have increased their efforts on central bank digital currencies to compete with Libra. Noting that it is not looking to issue its own digital currency at this time, the Fed said that a number of challenges must be resolved before Libra can be launched in the country.

Two major superpowers, the United States and China, are embroiled in a dramatic trade war where tit-for-tat tariffs have been placed on goods — breeding uncertainty for consumers and businesses alike and making everyday products more expensive. The United Kingdom is still embroiled in a messy divorce from the European Union, and Russia is ratcheting up tensions with its neighbors in the West.

All of this geopolitical drama has two effects. Firstly, it can wreak havoc on the markets, wiping billions of dollars off the value of major companies and affecting employment rates in the world’s economies. Secondly, it is prompting some enthusiasts to passionately advocate for crypto and blockchain taking a bigger role in the economy. They say it could help bring down borders, making international payments faster and less expensive, while encouraging trade between nations.

That said, crypto and blockchain are also creating new geopolitical challenges. North Korea has faced allegations that a sophisticated group of hackers are launching cyberattacks on major exchanges in neighboring South Korea and other parts of Asia. Millions of dollars have been lost, with each incident shaking consumer confidence to its core. India has also been resolute in its decision to push ahead with a crypto ban. This could have ramifications for the likes of Facebook, which is hoping to launch a stablecoin that would benefit the unbanked. The Libra project is also creating tensions around the world, with many countries — the U.S. and the EU among them — concerned that the cryptocurrency could undermine traditional payment infrastructure and overtake the dollar and the euro.

Regulating crypto

A major thing that’s holding cryptocurrency back is the disjointed, fragmented approach to regulation around the world. While some countries like India are taking a hardline approach by proposing jail terms for anyone found handling these coins and tokens, the likes of Japan and Canada have been far more laidback — encouraging innovation, enabling taxes to be paid using Bitcoin, and creating so-called “regulatory sandboxes” where new crypto products can be tested on a small portion of the population before being rolled out.

There is a real and pressing divide when it comes to the attitudes surrounding crypto and blockchain. In some countries, there is incredible caution surrounding this technology amid fears it could have a detrimental impact on vulnerable consumers. That said, there are politicians out there who are appalled by the negative attitude that’s being espoused towards the industry — people who believe in its potential and believe their country should be at the forefront of innovation.

In part, this desire for a pro-crypto stance lies in fears that certain countries may be getting a headstart on developing their own central bank digital currency, establishing early dominance. One such country is China — which is already set to embark on a rapid acceleration of blockchain usage at the behest of President Xi Jinping.

What of the future?

Reading the tea leaves to figure out what the future holds for crypto and blockchain is a challenge. Will China achieve dominance and launch a central bank digital currency? Will India be successful in its quest to ban cryptocurrency? Will Russia succeed in its quest to enable law enforcement to confiscate Bitcoin, and is this even possible?

With so many unknowns, conferences have gained popularity as a way of hearing valuable insights from some of the best-known practitioners in the crypto and blockchain industries. One of them is the Crypto Finance Conference, which is taking place from Jan. 15 to 17 in St. Moritz, Switzerland.

Organizers of the conference say that they are determined to cater each session to the individual needs of attendees. To that end, some of the event’s main speakers are going to be taking time to answer questions both onstage and offstage. Extensive networking opportunities are also on offer, giving delegates the chance to delve into areas of particular interest and establish meaningful contacts.

The program is still under development — but already, there are a series of sessions that will interest those who are keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments in the industry. The first day will explore the global impact of crypto and blockchain, and offer predictions for the future. There’s little doubt that the talk on the evolution of central banking will explore the attitudes that countries worldwide are adopting when it comes to everything from Bitcoin to Libra. Tales from the global regulatory frontline are also going to be shared.

Greitai is a booking platform specializing in low-cost flights, accommodation, and car rentals. It’s operated by the Vilnius-headquartered Interneto Partneris. The Lithuanian company maintains a network of websites offering services in 21 other countries in Europe. It supports a variety of payment methods depending on the market. In Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Slovakia and Georgia, Greitai takes half a dozen cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH, and XRP.

More Than Just Tickets and Rooms

A travel site that’s available in multiple languages — over 30 — is Destinia. It offers a rich choice of services that go beyond airline tickets, hotel accommodation and car hire. Travelers can buy train tickets, rent apartments, and purchase ski packages as well. The Spain-based agency supports 72 currency options including several cryptocurrencies like bitcoin core, bitcoin cash, ethereum, eos, dash, and litecoin. You can pay with any of these coins but note that the prices are displayed in millibitcoins, mBTC, mBCH and so on.

Several travel companies accept crypto through integration with the U.S. payment processor Bitpay. That means you can book flights and pay for hotel stays with bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC). Britain-based Corporate Traveller specializes in business travel management services for companies that need travel arrangements for their employees, as many businesses around the world cannot afford to close for the holidays. Another U.K.-headquartered travel agency, Alternative Airlines, is working to introduce crypto payments for its customers in cooperation with the Swiss payments processor Utrust. The partnership was announced last week.

Airtreks is a booking platform that also uses the services of Bitpay. It helps clients who need travel itineraries that involve multi-stop and even round the world trips. Airbaltic, the flag carrier of Latvia, provides a great variety of fiat payment options including bank transfers, credit cards, payment processors like Paypal and Ideal, but it also takes BCH and BTC via Bitpay. Keep in mind that, according to its website, the cryptocurrency option is “only available for Basic tickets for flights booked at least five days ahead of the scheduled departure.” Bitpay is also among the listed payment methods on the German travel site Fluege.

Hundreds of millions of virtual currencies allegedly ended up in FSB's hands (Photo: Sulayman Sanyang/Pixabay) Wex, a crypto exchange platform in Russian, with hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins and other virtual currencies, collapsed at the end of last year.

According to the BBC investigation, there is also a possibility that a Wex founder, Alexander Bilyuchenko, may have transferred the Bitcoin to FSB accounts.

The report reminds that Wex was launched in 2017 as a successor to another Russian crypto exchange platform - BTC-e, which the FBI shut down. US authorities accused the platform of laundering up to $4 billion of dirty money from all over the world.

One BTC-e's client was the Russian cyber-espionage group known as Fancy Bear, which US prosecutors alleged used bitcoins to fund hacking the US Democratic National Committee in 2016.

Bilyuchenko, a business partner of BTC-e's main operator - Alexander Vinnik, together with Dmitry Vasilyev, a high-volume BTC-e's client, then formed Wex, promising, as Meduza news outlet reminded, to return some of the funds its clients had lost in their dealings with BTC-e.

The BBC's report alleges that Bilyuchenko and Vasilyev started looking, in early 2018, for influential patrons for their exchange, and eventually found Konstantin Malofeev, a Russian oligarch and founder of Marshall Capital, a leading Russian investment group. Malofeev has also been known as a pro-Kremlin billionaire under US, Canadian and EU sanctions for bankrolling Moscow-backed forces in Eastern Ukraine.

Bilyuchenko and Malofeev reportedly agreed to build on the foundation of Wex ""a new exchange that would serve as specialized accounting infrastructure to protect the financial and economic sovereignty of the Russian Federation.""

As Bilyuchenko later testified, FSB agents contacted him, and ""an individual named Anton demanded"" he hands over a flash drive containing encrypted Wex assets, saying that the cryptocurrency in the exchange would ""go to the account of the FSB of Russia.""

The BBC has also obtained audio recordings between individuals discussing the Wex platform, in which the outlet says Konstantin Malofeev discussed the importance of bringing Wex under the control of the FSB.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-continue-to-drop-bitcoin-briefly-slips-below-8-200,"After another sell-off earlier today, crypto markets have continued to fall, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dropping below the $8,200 threshold.

After Bitcoin failed to reclaim $8,500 earlier today, its price has only continued to fall, dropping to as low as $8,104 per coin earlier on the day. At press time, Bitcoin has attempted a modest recovery and is trading at $8,215, down 4% over the past 24 hours.

New downturn to open up the potential for Bitcoin to return to $7,400

While Bitcoin is seeing a significant drop over the past seven days, down more than 5%, the major cryptocurrency is almost flat over the past 30 days at press time.

The fresh decline in the market is considered by some analysts to expose Bitcoin to a potential return to $7,400, as Cointelegraph reported today.

In contrast, other analysts suggested that Bitcoin’s recent trading into a falling wedge is typically a bullish pattern that has a success rate of breaking to the upside in around 68% of cases.

Last week, the CEO and co-founder of Distributed Lab claimed that Bitcoin price could “crash to zero” in the event of mass adoption by institutions.

A lack of positive developments in the crypto and blockchain space has led to fading sentiment and further declines in bitcoin's price.

A long-term bear crossover of the 100 and 200-day moving averages (MAs) confirms BTC's latest leg down.

BTC looks set to test the 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, now located at $7,520.

Bitcoin prices tumbled over 4 percent Monday as buyers proved reluctant to engage with the market, likely due to recent suggestions of a new crypto crackdown in China.

At press time on Tuesday, the world’s top crypto by market capitalization had dropped further, and was down 3.03 percent on the day. Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $8,144, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Amid the lack of trader enthusiasm, two long-term moving averages – the 100 and 200-day – crossed over on Nov. 17, suggesting a long-term trend change in favor of the bears.

As seen above, a crossover of the two averages, whereby the 100-period moves below the 200-period, does not bode well for bitcoin’s price. Back in early 2018, a long-term bear cross saw prices fall by as much as 60 percent.

While past events are not indicative of future results, it does raise the question: how far can bitcoin’s value fall?

Further losses will expose prices to the 100-period moving average on the weekly chart, now located at $7,520.

With a lack of bullish fundamentals, bitcoin is deflating under seller pressure, as reflected in the daily and weekly RSI’s (not shown) which are in bearish territory beneath the neutral 50.00 line.

Selling volume has also risen to its highest in three days, adding to the credence of the downside move.

The bulls need to enter back into the fray in force if they hope to stem the bleeding, and need a firm close above $9,000 to reverse the current trend.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fidelity Digital Assets, the cryptocurrency company of Boston-based Fidelity Investments, has been granted a license by New York’s financial regulator, the company said on Tuesday.

The limited-purpose trust company charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services will allow the company to offer its cryptocurrency trading and custody services to companies based in the state, it said.

“We have experienced a high interest level from these firms and anticipate that their increased involvement in this industry would enable more activities and development across the spectrum,” the company said in a blog post.

Fidelity Digital Assets was launched in October 2018 with the aim of better serving traditional financial institutions looking to invest in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.

The dearth of custody and other back-office services by brand-name financial companies has been one of the road blocks to more institutional investments in the new asset class.

Demand for digital currencies has been shifting since the company’s launch, Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said in an interview.

“We are seeing strong demand and greater diversity of client types,” Jessop said. “There are more traditional investors. When we started it was crypto funds and hedge funds.”

Other large financial companies have started offering cryptocurrency products and services, including Intercontinental Exchange Inc ICE.N, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and CME Group Inc CME.O.

Over the next year Fidelity Digital Assets plans to start offering its services for other types of cryptocurrencies and is considering opportunities overseas, Jessop said.",2019-11-19 16:10:23+00:00,https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-new-cryptocurrency-ecosystem/,"50 Years of Gaming History, by Revenue Stream (1970-2020)

View a more detailed version of the above by clicking here

Every year it feels like the gaming industry sees the same stories—record sales, unfathomable market reach, and questions of how much higher the market can go.

We’re already far past the point of gaming being the biggest earning media sector, with an estimated $165 billion revenue generated in 2020.

But as our graphic above helps illustrate, it’s important to break down shifting growth within the market. Research from Pelham Smithers shows that while the tidal wave of gaming has only continued to swell, the driving factors have shifted over the course of gaming history.

1970–1983: The Pre-Crash Era

At first, there was Atari.

Early prototypes of video games were developed in labs in the 1960s, but it was Atari’s release of Pong in 1972 that helped to kickstart the industry.

The arcade table-tennis game was a sensation, drawing in consumers eager to play and companies that started to produce their own knock-off versions. Likewise, it was Atari that sold a home console version of Pong in 1975, and eventually its own Atari 2600 home console in 1977, which would become the first console to sell more than a million units.

In short order, the arcade market began to plateau. After dwindling due to a glut of Pong clones, the release of Space Invaders in 1978 reinvigorated the market.

Arcade machines started to be installed everywhere, and new franchises like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong drove further growth. By 1982, arcades were already generating more money than both the pop music industry and the box office.

1985–2000: The Tech Advancement Race

Unfortunately, the gaming industry grew too quickly to maintain.

Eager to capitalize on a growing home console market, Atari licensed extremely high budget ports of Pac-Man and a game adaptation of E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. They were rushed to market, released in poor quality, and cost the company millions in returns and more in brand damage.

As other companies also looked to capitalize on the market, many other poor attempts at games and consoles caused a downturn across the industry. At the same time, personal computers were becoming the new flavor of gaming, especially with the release of the Commodore 64 in 1982.

It was a sign of what was to define this era of gaming history: a technological race. In the coming years, Nintendo would release the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) home console in 1985 (released in Japan as the Famicom), prioritizing high quality games and consistent marketing to recapture the wary market.

On the backs of games like Duck Hunt, Excitebike, and the introduction of Mario in Super Mario Bros, the massive success of the NES revived the console market.

Nintendo looked to continue its dominance in the field, with the release of the Game Boy handheld and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. At the same time, other competitors stepped in to beat them at their own game.

In 1988, arcade company Sega entered the fray with the Sega Mega Drive console (released as the Genesis in North America) and then later the Game Gear handheld, putting its marketing emphasis on processing power.

Electronics maker Sony released the PlayStation in 1994, which used CD-ROMs instead of cartridges to enhance storage capacity for individual games. It became the first console in history to sell more than 100 million units, and the focus on software formats would carry on with the PlayStation 2 (DVDs) and PlayStation 3 (Blu-rays).

Even Microsoft recognized the importance of gaming on PCs and developed the DirectX API to assist in game programming. That “X” branding would make its way to the company’s entry into the console market, the Xbox.

2001–Present: The Online Boom

It was the rise of the internet and mobile, however, that grew the gaming industry from tens of billions to hundreds of billions in revenue.

A primer was the viability of subscription and freemium services. In 2001, Microsoft launched the Xbox Live online gaming platform for a monthly subscription fee, giving players access to multiplayer matchmaking and voice chat services, quickly becoming a must-have for consumers.

Meanwhile on PCs, Blizzard was tapping into the Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) subscription market with the 2004 release of World of Warcraft, which saw a peak of more than 14 million monthly paying subscribers.

All the while, companies saw a future in mobile gaming that they were struggling to tap into. Nintendo continued to hold onto the handheld market with updated Game Boy consoles, and Nokia and BlackBerry tried their hands at integrating game apps into their phones.

But it was Apple’s iPhone that solidified the transition of gaming to a mobile platform. The company’s release of the App Store for its smartphones (followed closely by Google’s own store for Android devices) paved the way for app developers to create free, paid, and pay-per-feature games catered to a mass market.

Now, everyone has their eyes on that growing $85 billion mobile slice of the gaming market, and game companies are starting to heavily consolidate.

Console makers like Microsoft and Sony are launching cloud-based subscription services even while they continue to develop new consoles. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google are launching their own services that work on multiple devices, mobile included.

After seeing the success that games like Pokémon Go had on smartphones—reaching more than $1 billion in yearly revenue—and Grand Theft Auto V’s record breaking haul of $1 billion in just three days, companies are targeting as much of the market as they can.

And with the proliferation of smartphones, social media games, and streaming services, they’re on the right track. There are more than 2.7 billion gamers worldwide in 2020, and how they choose to spend their money will continue to shape gaming history as we know it.",2019-11-19 10:28:11-08:00,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/winklevoss-twins-acquire-crypto-firm-nifty-run-by-other-identical-2019-11-1028701764,"Thomson Reuters

Nifties can range from a game item to a token representing ownership of a physical asset, and are tracked on blockchain ledgers.

The acquisition had ""so many great parallels,"" Tyler Winklevoss told Bloomberg, and made for ""just the right fit.""

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made their first-ever acquisition, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, and the entrepreneurs involved have more than their crypto interests in common.

The Winklevii purchased Nifty Gateway, a business that allows user to buy ""nifties"" — digital collectibles tracked on a blockchain ledger — with a credit card. The company's founders, Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster, are also identical twins.

""You can't make this stuff up,"" Tyler Winklevoss told Bloomberg. ""There are so many great parallels, it was just the right fit.""

Nifties can range from an in-game item to a token representing a physical item like a painting or book. Such collectibles are typically purchased with digital-currency wallets, which require several steps and transfers to set up.

The Winklevoss twins rose to fame for their role in Facebook's founding. They now run Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2015 that looks to bring government regulation and legitimacy to the volatile asset.

The Winklevoss' Gemini Trust acquired Nifty for an undisclosed amount, and the two crypto-related ventures will continue to work separately from each other. The arrangement could change, and Nifty services could find their way onto Gemini's platform, according to Bloomberg.

The Cock Foster's platform currently allows users to buy nifties from OpenSea marketplace and the CryptoKitties and Gods Unchained games, according to Bloomberg. Duncan Cock Foster projects nifties to reach 1 billion collectors in the future. The Winklevoss twins are similarly optimistic, telling Bloomberg the nifties industry will eventually dwarf the art, gaming, and collectibles markets.

""All great companies, all great ideas there's a period where you see a truth and many other people don't, and you have to have that conviction,"" Tyler Winklevoss told Bloomberg.

The new funds aim to bring “the wealth of America,” or people who may have largely remained out of crypto investing, to cryptocurrency markets, Novogratz told Bloomberg Nov. 19.

According to Bloomberg, the funds will offer third-party custody from major crypto consortium Bakkt and Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital asset arm of American investment management company Fidelity Investments.

Galaxy Bitcoin Fund and Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund

The two new Bitcoin funds — Galaxy Bitcoin Fund and Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund — have reportedly been established with Galaxy’s own money and some participation from existing investors, according to the report.

The Galaxy Bitcoin Fund will require a $25,000 minimum investment, and investors will be able to withdraw their funds on a quarterly basis. Meanwhile, Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund has weekly liquidity and a higher initial threshold, the report notes.

Both funds will reportedly charge lower fees than major Bitcoin funds such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.

Boomers’ wealth is OK

Novogratz’s plans will ostensibly bring a significant amount of investment from older demographics as Bitcoin investment is specifically led by the tech-savvy younger generation in the 18–34 age range. Meanwhile, the share of American Bitcoin investors over 50 years old reportedly accounts for 3%.

According to a recent study from wealth management firm United Income, Americans under 50 only hold 16% of all investable assets, compared with 31% in 1989. This leaves a massive amount of untapped wealth among older investors that, according to United Income, will comprise $36 trillion in inheritances in the next 30 years.

Novogratz is ever the bull

Novogratz, a 54-year-old billionaire and known Bitcoin bull, claimed that there are probably 20 billionaires he could name that made their money outside of crypto and are in crypto now. He added that the new Bitcoin funds could attract investors who are now buying gold.

Additionally, Novogratz said he expects that traditional financial services companies will let users invest in Bitcoin in the next 12 months.

Earlier today, major Bitcoin fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust filed Form 10 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to become the first crypto fund to report to the regulator. If the filing is approved. Grayscale could see its investor base widen, as more institutional investors will be able to dabble in Bitcoin.",,https://www.coindesk.com/paypal-joins-4-2m-round-for-crypto-banking-compliance-firm,"Financial institutions know how to calculate the risk of serving traditional businesses. But for firms touching cryptocurrency, the math is still fuzzy. The assumption of added regulatory hurdles and money-laundering fears have led to a widespread problem: Your average bank would rather just not deal with it.

Addressing those concerns with clear-eyed data is how compliance startup TRM Labs wants to accelerate the institutional embrace of crypto. And that’s why a group of investors are backing the blockchain analytics firm to the tune of $4.2 million in new funding.

“Many might consider this the unsexy plumbing of the financial system but it’s what allows [crypto adoption] to thrive,” TRM Labs co-founder and CEO Esteban Castaño said in an interview. “We’re helping financial institutions to think through crypto’s potential as well as to mitigate any of the associated risks.”

The slate of investors includes Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian’s Initialized Capital, SF stalwart Blockchain Capital and a new strategic partner, PayPal Ventures. The influx of capital brings TRM’s total funding to $5.9 million after the startup emerged out of Y Combinator earlier this year.

It’s only the second blockchain-related investment disclosed by PayPal Ventures (the first was in April 2019) and comes just a month after PayPal itself withdrew from the Facebook-led Libra Association.

Chainalysis, but for banks

While competing firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic are known for aiding law enforcement, TRM Labs is focused solely on finance.

“Financial institutions use TRM to risk-score their cryptocurrency-related transactions, customers, or partnerships, helping them to simplify customer due diligence and meet regulatory requirements,” the company said in a statement.

That means the startup scours over a dozen blockchains, analyzing billions of transactions for signs of fraud and money-laundering.

The heightened interest from major players in traditional finance comes from a dawning realization that exposure to crypto is now “inevitable,” Castaño said.

“This new world is coming,” he said. “We’re going to help the existing financial system adapt to this new world so they can effectively engage with it.”

That doesn’t mean TRM is alone. Chainalysis, for one, already serves the finance sector, apparently to mixed reviews.

“The existing providers are trying to tailor products to financial institutions, and we’re just finding they’re not doing a good job of that,” Blockchain Capital’s Spencer Bogart told CoinDesk.

Regardless, he said, getting those institutions comfortable with crypto requires conforming to existing rules and regulations around tracking the provenance of customer funds.

“Every time we’re talking to a financial institution, number one or two on their list of concerns is compliance and risk management,” Bogart said.

TRM Labs is a team of 20, according to Castaño. The San Francisco-based company says it will use the new funding for product development, hiring and expanding to new geographies.",2019-11-19 13:00:00+00:00,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-paypal-cfo-roelof-botha-bank-of-america-shut-account-2019-11-1028700108,"Brian Ach/Getty

PayPal's former finance chief revealed Bank of America closed his account without explanation, sparking conspiracies that he may have been banned for trading bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital and one of Silicon Valley's most famous investors, shared the news in a tweet on Monday.

""After being a customer of @BankofAmerica for 20 years, I received this notice today that they decided to fire me as their customer! With absolutely no explanation....""

Botha — who sits on the boards of Square, Bird, Evernote, and other tech companies — attached the notice from Bank of America, which stated his account would be permanently closed in 30 days.

""After a careful review of your banking relationship, we've made the decision to close your account above,"" it reads. ""This decision is final and won't be reconsidered.""

Several members of the crypto community pointed out that PayPal has banned users for trading bitcoin, and suggested Botha may have been banned by his bank for the same reason.

""That's funny indeed, he did the same to many people but complains when it happens to him,"" crypto investor @JohanDXB replied to his tweet.

Manu Kumar — head of seed fund K9 Ventures, which invested in Lyft and Twilio — replied that the ""same thing happened to @K9Ventures' account at @BankofAmerica. No explanation what so ever.""

Kumar tweeted in January that Bank of America closed his company account due to a ""determination that this is a business type we have chosen not to serve.""

Tron and BitTorrent CEO Justin Sun — who famously paid $4.6 million for a charity lunch with Warren Buffett and invited Donald Trump to join them, only to postpone at the last minute — said the same thing happened to him.

""Me too 😂 I have been a customer of @BankofAmerica for 8 years and get fired as well 🤣"" he wrote in a tweet that was later deleted.

David Marcus, PayPal's former president and co-creator of Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency, replied to Botha's tweet saying, ""You're clearly not their target customer segment...""

Bank of America also replied to Botha's tweet, saying ""accounts are closed for various reasons"" and inviting him to call the company for a review of his accounts.

Bank of America didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

",,https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/does-bitcoin-need-to-climb-higher-to-be-etf-ready/,"Could cyrptocurrency ETFs be too small to get SEC approval? That is what one crypto expert contends about Bitcoin.

Bitcoin would need to rocket past $150,000 per coin to make an exchange-traded fund for the cryptocurrency possible, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said, according to Bloomberg. With the notorious crypto trading at just over $8,190 right now, that would demand a roughly 1,670% increase from current levels.

“The SEC needs to punt the ETF until crypto becomes bigger,” Lee reportedly said at conference in Singapore on Friday, adding that “demand for an ETF is monstrous.”

One of the main issues with releasing a Bitcoin ETF is the regulatory issues surrounding it. Regulators are spooked by the potential for criminal activity as cryptos become a potentially more potent force in the currency world.

“Cryptocurrency either doesn’t work in which case investors lose a lot of money — or it does achieve its objectives, and displaces the U.S. dollar as the sole reserve currency in the world,” Rep. Sherman said during a recent SEC hearing. “You’re going to be making powerful burglary tools and letting your business partners commit the burglary.”

Bitcoin tumbled in October as members of Congress strove to underscore the downsides of the cryptocurrency on Capitol Hill.

The crypto plummeted as much as 9% to a low of $7,435.26, tagging bitcoin’s lowest level since June.

The drop also occurred as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg presented plans to the House Financial Services Committee regarding new cryptocurrency, Libra. Lawmakers have lambasted the project and criticized cryptocurrencies as having money laundering and terrorism potential.

“Institutions aren’t going to touch crypto if they think the SEC isn’t doing a good job,” Lee reportedly added.

Still, there are some who see the cryptocurrency as a diversification tool and in some cases a safe haven amid times of economic and political turmoil.

“If bitcoin is increasingly used as an asset with monetary value, what role might it play within an investment portfolio?,” said VanEck in a recent note. “Bitcoin may potentially increase portfolio diversification because of its low correlation to traditional asset classes, including broad market equity indices, bonds, and gold.”

$200 Million Investment Fund

Bitcoin.com is planning to launch a $200 million BCH investment fund in 2020 that will focus on payment related solutions and non-custodial financial services for Bitcoin Cash. The fund will invest in and incubate businesses like payment gateways, processors remittances, wallet and merchant acquirers.

Details of the BCH Ecosystem Investment Fund are not yet finalized but it will allow for other institutional investors to join the fund. Backers will then be presented with a portfolio of Bitcoin Cash payment related businesses to invest in. A dedicated landing page for projects to submit their business plans was just launched and is available here.

Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust has been screening institutional investment companies and has identified up to 20 that align with the company’s vision and satisfy its stringent due diligence requirements. Bitcoin.com would charge a fee helping institutional investors manage the fund, on top of the fees to access the underlying payment businesses. Institutions are said to be very interested in investing alongside Roger Ver and Bitcoin.com, taking a share in the upside of future BCH development.

“We are super excited to launch the $200 million ecosystem fund that will rapidly scale up Bitcoin Cash focused businesses,” stated Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust. “Bitcoin.com receives between 6 to 8 business plans every day from software entrepreneurs leveraging the unique features and capabilities of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Bitcoin.com now has the resources and team to support these BCH entrepreneurs, grow the value of their businesses and spread bitcoin cash adoption.”

Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver added: “There is so much great infrastructure and businesses being built in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem every day. Bitcoin.com is going to accelerate the development with our million-dollar ecosystem investment fund.” He recently presented the idea to the community in a Bitcoin Cash Meetup in London.

Promoting the BCH Ecosystem

Bitcoin.com is strongly promoting the adoption of Bitcoin Cash as peer-to-peer electronic money as well as the development of the surrounding BCH ecosystem. Recently the electronics manufacturer HTC added native bitcoin cash support to its flagship smartphone, Exodus 1, following a partnership with the company. And it is in discussions about listing a bitcoin cash futures contract on a new exchange with approval from the U.S. CFTC, which is expected to reach the market by the first quarter of 2020.

The company also supports the adoption of the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP), a token system for the Bitcoin Cash network allowing anyone to create tokens in a permissionless manner. The protocol has helped the development of an ecosystem for BCH that replicates the variety of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network. This is one of the reasons the company launched Bitcoin.com Exchange in September, giving projects a platform for listing their SLP tokens. Moreover, Bitcoin.com’s suite of developer tools has been downloaded more than 36,000 times from over 100 countries. The team even helps with the organization of many local BCH meetups around the world.

The CEO of Paypal, Daniel Schulman, has revealed in an interview that he personally owns bitcoin. He also talked about Paypal’s plans regarding cryptocurrency, how to achieve mass adoption, and why Paypal decided to leave Facebook’s Libra project.

Schulman Owns Bitcoin

Daniel Schulman, the president and CEO of Paypal, admitted in an interview with Fortune last week that he personally owns bitcoin. He joined Paypal in 2014 to lead it as an independent company from Ebay Inc.

Schulman was asked numerous questions regarding his crypto investment, Paypal’s crypto projects and the company’s decision to exit the Libra project. As for his own crypto holdings, the publication asked: “Do you personally own any cryptocurrencies?” The CEO promptly replied:

Yes. Bitcoin.

To clarify that he only owns one type of cryptocurrency, the publication further asked, “Only Bitcoin?” The executive confirmed, “Only. Yes.” However, he did not reveal how much he owns.

Schulman brought extensive experience in payment solutions to Paypal, having served as Group President of Enterprise Growth at American Express, President of the Prepaid Group at Sprint Nextel Corp, CEO of Priceline Group Inc., and holding various leading positions at AT&T.

Paypal’s Own Crypto Projects

Paypal is also working on its own crypto projects. CFO John Rainey said earlier this year that the company had teams working on blockchain and cryptocurrency. Fortune asked the CEO if he could share some details of the projects Paypal is working on. However, he replied: “Yes and no. Some of this is competitive, and we don’t really want to,” but noted that what Paypal is working on is “not necessarily competitive with Libra.”

Emphasizing that cryptocurrency is “still very volatile,” the CEO revealed, “we don’t have much demand for it by merchants because merchants operate on very small margins.” He continued: “Until it becomes less volatile, it won’t be a currency that is widely accepted by merchants on the web — not the dark web, but the web.” Schulman elaborated:

That doesn’t mean that I don’t think crypto is an interesting idea and that people are trading it quite a bit. It’s more commodity-like than it is cash-like right now. But you can think of use cases in different countries and different places where it can be more stable than the alternatives.

This is not the first time Schulman has raised concerns about bitcoin’s volatility. In January, he told Thestreet that “the volatility of the cryptocurrency makes it actually unsuitable to be a real currency that retailers can accept.” He also told CNBC, “We’re not seeing many retailers at all accept any of the cryptocurrencies.”

While skeptical of cryptocurrency, Paypal sees promise in blockchain technology. “We think there’s a lot of promise to blockchain technology. It’s intriguing to us, but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails can’t do,” the CEO told Fortune. “We think a lot of the neat stuff that can happen on blockchain is around identity, for example.”

In addition, Paypal has filed a number of crypto-related patents. While the company has yet to announce any crypto projects, Piper Jaffray analyst Jason Deleeuw believes that the timing of the patent application, coupled with company announcements, “suggests that any near-term solutions by Paypal to make crypto merchant payments scalable may have been de-prioritized.” A spokesperson for the company said last year, “we are interested in any technologies, processes or applications that have the potential to enable our mission of financial inclusion.”

Withdrawing From Libra Project

Before Schulman took over as the CEO of Paypal, Facebook’s Head of the Libra project, David Marcus, ran the company. He left Paypal on June 27, 2014, to lead the social media giant’s messaging products. When Facebook announced its plans for the Libra digital currency project in June, Marcus visited his former company to talk about the project. Initially, “he framed it in ways that were appealing to us about financial inclusion,” Schulman told Fortune.

However, as more details were revealed about Libra, the Paypal team realized that the project had many more things left to do and Paypal was already working on its own project to achieve a similar goal. After much deliberation, the company concluded that “if we focus on our own roadmap, we’d be able to advance financial inclusion faster than if we put all these resources against Libra,” the CEO shared. “It wasn’t an acrimonious divorce or anything like that. It’s just that they will start going down a road that we’re very interested in looking at and monitoring, and maybe later, there are ways we can work together. I wish them the best of luck on it.”

Schulman additionally claims that the regulatory burden Libra is facing was not the reason driving Paypal away from the project. “That wasn’t really what spooked us on it,” the CEO elaborated. “It was just about, ‘Where do we want to put our attention, and what do we want to do today to advance our mission?’ Once they start figuring things out, we’ll take another look at where they are.”

The new Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem Fund will focus on payment solutions and non-custodial financial services for Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency that emerged from a hard fork of Bitcoin in August 2017.

The new fund will be investing in payment gateways and wallet acquirers

According to an official announcement, details of the BCH Ecosystem Investment Fund are not yet finalized but it will allow participation from institutional investors. The fund will be investing in payment gateways, processors remittances, wallet and merchant acquirers.

Bitcoin.com’s new CEO, Stefan Rust, has reportedly identified up to 20 potential institutional investors that share the company’s vision and are interested to invest alongside Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman Ver and the company itself.

Bitcoin.com recently launched its own crypto exchange

Formerly known as a website focused on covering BTC and BCH, Bitcoin.com now provides a number of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash services including crypto trading and storage. The firm behind the website has been gradually embracing more services since its domain name was acquired by Ver back in 2014.

Bitcoin.com launched its own digital exchange in September 2019, allowing users to trade a number of cryptocurrencies including XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and EOS, among others.

Increasing emergence of new crypto funds

Meanwhile, the number of new crypto-related funds appears to be surging. Yesterday, Michael Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital announced the launch of two Bitcoin funds, targeting “the wealth of America,” or people between the ages of 50 and 80. Last week, ConsenSys’ CSO Sam Cassatt announced that his new blockchain-oriented investment firm Aligned Capital is planning to raise $50 million for its first fund.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/singapore-crypto-derivatives-set-to-come-under-regulatory-oversight,"Singapore's central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has proposed bringing crypto derivatives trading under its purview.

According to a BNN Bloomberg report on Nov. 20, the MAS’ proposal would make the trading of derivatives based on underlying assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) subject to the city-state’s Securities and Futures Act.

Institutional investor interest sparked proposal

According to the MAS, plans to extend its remit to crypto derivatives have been spurred by interest from hedge funds and asset managers engaged in the sector.

Bitcoin derivatives trading globally currently sees $5–10 billion in daily traded volume, exceeding spot volume by 10 to 18 times, the report notes, citing data from Skew and BitcoinTradeVolume.

MAS has said its proposal will “allow approved exchanges in Singapore to meet the need of investors to manage their exposure to payment tokens while bringing the activity under regulatory oversight.”

As reported earlier this month, the Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE) Bakkt platform is planning to expand its existing Bitcoin futures products to include a cash-settled option. Sources have claimed the new contract will be offered via ICE’s Singapore-based clearinghouse, ICE Clear Singapore, and traded on the ICE Futures Singapore exchange.

Bakkt, CME and beyond

Bakkt made industry history in September with its launch of a physically-settled Bitcoin monthly futures contract.

However, the platform’s underwhelming volumes in the first week following its launch were unfavorably compared to the fiat-settled BTC futures on CME, which first launched back in December 2017.

Bakkt reported 1,135 traded contracts (~$9.3 million) yesterday, Nov. 19, having reported an all-time high of 1,756 contracts on Nov. 8, according to tracking data compiled by Twitter account Bakkt Volume Bot.

To increase your venture capital or VC funding by 10%, tell investors you run a ‘platform,’ not a regular business. If you want to increase your funding by 20%, tell investors that you are operating in the ‘fintech space’. But if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using ‘blockchain” ~ Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.

The Blockchain Fever

Blockchain technology – a native language for those in the space and a foreign language for those outside. Nevertheless, the sentiment for blockchain has always been bullish as everyone wants to buy into a technology that “solves it all.”

When Bitcoin soared to its highest valuation towards the end of 2017, it was also the beginning of blockchain mania. Everyone wanted to buy in on the technology, from start-ups to conglomerate companies to banks and governments; they all wanted to jump on board the ship that would take them ‘to the moon.’

The hype built was so much so that existing companies started to rebrand their names with either “blockchain” or “Bitcoin” in it. The companies that did, saw a massive surge in their stock prices during the crypto-craze.

However, when the Bitcoin bubble burst with the price of the cryptocurrency seeing a slump of over 80 percent from its all-time high, even though the ICO mania registered lower tones of exuberance, Blockchain technology was here to stay!

Even now, several private and public sectors are implementing blockchain to test out its promising use cases, with governments taking the lead.

It’s about the tech, not the cryptocurrency



“Disruptive technologies such as Block-chain and the Internet of Things, will have a profound impact in the way we live and work. They will require rapid adaptation in our workplaces” ~ PM Narendra Modi.

Indian regulatory authorities’ pessimistic view of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is no new tale to tell. However, their view on blockchain, on the contrary, is a completely different story. State governments are racing to be on top of the blockchain game, from providing incentives to enterprises and start-ups to establishing training centers, making blockchain technology the flavor of the season.

On Blockchain’s potential in India, Sidharth Sogani, CEO of CREBACO, told AMBCrypto,

“In India, blockchain space is a car without a driver. We see the prime minister talking about blockchain because this is a hyped technology […] India has tremendous growth potential with estimated market size of 12.9Billion USD and the possibility of creating over 20000 Jobs in the very first year of regulation. India has the best tech developers who are still handcuffed from venturing into the crypto and blockchain space in my opinion”

In India, blockchain space is a car without a driver. We see the prime minister talking about blockchain because this is a hyped technology.

A report by NASSCOM titled ‘Indian Blockchain Report 2019’ stated that “nearly half the states in India have initiated blockchain projects to address different elements of citizen service delivery.” The leading use cases the technology is being leveraged for are land registry, farm insurance, and digital certificates.

Presently, Telangana and Andra Pradesh, the two states that were once united, are head to head in the blockchain game, with AP pushing Vizag with the “Fintech Valley Vizag Initiative” and Telangana nurturing Hyderabad in its blockchain policy draft that was released earlier this year.

On Telangana and Andra Pradesh stepping into the blockchain space, Sidharth Sogani said,

“The Andra Pradesh and Telangana governments claim to have a Blockchain, but it’s a centralized blockchain which doesn’t really solve the purpose. The data hence is not immutable. They have done few pilot projects to put land and other governments record on blockchain-based certificates, but its easy and even a 15-year-old can do it. To do it in the right manner governments should first Regulate Research Educate And only then Invest.”

The most common use cases of blockchain in India’s public sector are,

Land title registry

Vehicle lifecycle management

Citizen electronic health record management

Organ tracking for transplant

Digital certificates

Benefits distribution

Rationing

E-governance

Benefit distribution

Chit fund operations administration

Farm insurance

Microfinance for self-help groups

Identity management

Power distribution

Cybersecurity

Duty payments

Agriculture supply chain

Interestingly, the emerging technology could also make its debut in India’s defense sector. The Defense Minister of India, Rajnath Singh, had stated,

“The role of AI, big data, and blockchain technology has already revolutionized that existing paradigm of warfighting. The defense industry is undergoing a churning to cope and employ these technologies, in order to safeguard the safety and security of critical infrastructure.”

Indian Banks Venture



While state governing bodies are head-to-head in the blockchain game, other sectors are not particularly shying away from the new disruptive technology either. The banking sector in India has emerged as one of the leading sectors in India to leverage the technology for testing faster cross-border transactions and trade settlements.

On one hand, the Reserve Bank of India has time and again scoffed over the idea of cryptocurrencies; on the other hand, India’s central bank has also embraced its underlying technology. These financial institutions are directly collaborating with leading fintech firms in the cryptocurrency space to test out the use cases of blockchain, with Ripple standing out in the country.

Interestingly, the RBI itself has launched a blockchain initiative for banking purposes under its research and development branch, Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology [IDRBT]. The central bank will reportedly be launching blockchain applications this coming year.

The biggest Indian private banks that are also partaking in blockchain mania are Federal Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank. Other banks that are active in this sector include South Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India, and Induslnd Bank.

Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg also acknowledged the use cases presented by distributed ledger technology. Garg said,

“The DLT-based systems can be used by banks and other financial firms for processes such as loan-issuance tracking, collateral management, fraud detection, and claims management in insurance and reconciliation systems in the securities market”

Indian Companies Venture

Even major companies such as Bajaj Group, Tata Consultancy Services, and Reliance Industries Limited, India’s multinational conglomerates, have announced that they would be venturing into the blockchain space to provide better services. Reliance Industries’ CEO Mukesh Ambani unveiled the company’s blockchain venture during its 42nd Annual General Meeting [AGM].

Ambani stated that blockchain technology would be leveraged to “invent a brand-new model for data privacy,” while emphasizing that Indian users’ data will be “owned and controlled by the Indian people and not by corporates, especially global corporations.”

In August 2019, Mukesh Ambani, Managing Director of Reliance Industries Limited, added,

“Data is wealth and Indian wealth must remain in India. Over the next 12 months, Jio will install across India one of the largest blockchain networks in the world with tens of thousands of nodes operational on a daily basis”

While Ambani’s ambitions of Blockchain India is big, Sogani asserted that the dream would be fulfilled only if there was a token on top of it. He said,

“In my opinion, a blockchain with 10000 public nodes cannot function without a reward or a token on top. Hence, we may see crypto regulations soon, thanks to Mr.Ambani.”

Vincent Poon, VP of Bithumb, also spoke about India’s blockchain space in an interview with AMBCrypto. The South Korean-based cryptocurrency exchange recently announced its venture into India’s crypto-space, with the promise of being regulated if the regulatory environment is favorable. Additionally, the exchange also announced plans for partnering with blockchain-based startups and companies.

He stated,

“India is one of the most important regions for us. I have traveled to a lot of places and noticed that there was a huge developer base in India […] We’re more towards empowering the whole ecosystem, the crypto-to-crypto, the blockchain projects, incubating projects, and blockchain integrating projects. “

Futuristic View

While China and the USA are debating over who’s going to be the next tech supreme, India’s following close behind too. Moreover, a 2018 survey by PWC projected India to be among the top five blockchain leaders for 2021-2023, falling behind only China, the United States, and Australia.

",2019-11-20 15:00:34+00:00,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/11/191120080246.htm,"As an alternative to government-issued money, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers relative anonymity, no sales tax and freedom from bank and government interference. But some people argue that these benefits have an enormous environmental impact, particularly with regard to Bitcoin mining -- the process used to secure the cryptocurrency. Now, researchers reporting in ACS' Environmental Science & Technology have estimated that past and future environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining could be lower than previously thought.

In contrast to traditional banks, which keep records of balances and transactions at a centralized location, in Bitcoin all transactions are stored digitally as ""blocks"" in a chain that is kept by a network of peers. Using special computers, Bitcoin miners in this network compete to solve a mathematical puzzle. The winner, who earns the right to add the next block of data to the chain, is rewarded with new Bitcoin currency. This mining requires substantial electricity to power the special computers, but current estimates of the impact associated with this energy use suffer from a lack of accurate data. Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol wanted to conduct a life cycle assessment to better understand the total environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.

The researchers estimated the electricity consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 for each stage of Bitcoin mining, from the extraction of raw materials to make the equipment to its production, use and recycling. They calculated that the Bitcoin network consumed 31.3 Terawatt-hours of electricity and generated 17.3 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018, which were lower than previous estimates. About 99% of the environmental impact came from the use of the mining equipment, with minimal contributions from production and recycling. The location of the miners had the largest impact on the environment, with areas that use mostly fossil fuels for electricity, such as Inner Mongolia, China, contributing more to the carbon footprint than regions using renewable resources, such as Sichuan, China. The analysis also predicted that the environmental impact per miner will shrink if mining equipment becomes more efficient, use of renewable energy sources increases, or miners relocate to cooler climates, where less energy is needed to cool the computers. However, the overall number of miners is likely to continue increasing, at least in the short term, the researchers say.

Bitcoin mining consumed enough electricity last year to release carbon emissions on a par with Estonia, according to a study that suggests the climate change impact of the cryptocurrency isn’t as bad as previously thought.

Past research has suggested that the emissions from mining bitcoin – where computing power is used to solve mathematical problems to create new currency – may be as high as 63 megatonnes of CO 2 per year. Some researchers have even claimed the cryptocurrency alone could bust global climate goals.

Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol at Aalborg University in Denmark found that earlier estimates had made blanket assumptions that carbon emissions from electricity generation were uniform across China, where they estimate just over half of all bitcoin mining takes place.

But breaking down the emissions within China to a more regional level produced a much lower global footprint for the crytpocurrency, of 17.29 megatonnes of CO 2 in 2018. While coal-heavy Inner Mongolia accounted for just 12.3 per cent of bitcoin mining, it resulted in more than a quarter of the total emissions. The reverse effect was seen in the hydropower-rich Chinese province of Sichuan.

﻿

The researchers also found that it is overwhelmingly the electricity use of bitcoin mining that contributes to the cryptocurrency’s carbon emissions, not the production and disposal of the computers doing the mining, which accounted for just 1 per cent of the emissions.

Köhler says the findings don’t mean we can stop worrying about bitcoin – especially given electricity use per new bitcoin is growing – but we should put it in perspective. “On the one hand we have these alarmist voices saying we won’t hit the Paris agreement because of bitcoin only. But on the other hand there are a lot of voices from the bitcoin community saying that most of the mining is done with green energy and that it’s not high impact,” she says.

Getting a better handle on bitcoin’s carbon footprint will remain tricky until we have more accurate data on where mining takes place – information which Köhler and Pizzol say is scarce today.

Camilo Mora at the University of Hawaii, who wasn’t involved in the work, says the results show the need for more transparency on the location and equipment used in bitcoin mining. Even though the new estimate of the cryptocurrency’s climate contribution is smaller, he says it is hard to believe the impacts from mining are trivial, given many countries, including China, are considering regulating the activity because of its large electricity consumption.

Journal reference: Environmental Science and Technology, DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.9b05687",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/card-accepts-crypto-top-ups-can-be-used-in-atms-and-stores-worldwide,"A payment platform is offering a new prepaid card that can be used at ATMs, stores and websites worldwide — and topped up via bank transfers or cryptocurrency.

Embily is the brainchild of Singaporean company Blockchain International Group. Co-branded with Mastercard and UnionPay, card owners can top up using a plethora of digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Crypto is automatically converted into cash, giving the user freedom to make withdrawals at cash machines and make purchases at any point of sale terminal. The company adds it is focused on supplying business-to-business solutions to customers worldwide.

The team says extensive tests have been performed to ensure that its infrastructure is working correctly. One recent experiment saw 1 BTC (worth about $8,500 at the time of writing) loaded onto the card. Footage posted on YouTube appeared to show that the funds had successfully arrived and were available to spend in Singapore dollars. Other videos have shown the card working successfully in fast-food restaurants, and being used to purchase mobile phone data online.

Why Embily?

Embily’s founder, Alexander Bychkov, has said that one of his main motivations is ensuring that digital currencies such as Bitcoin can be used easily in everyday life. Some payment processing providers do allow merchants to accept crypto at the checkout, but this can be inconvenient for consumers who have to do plenty of research to track down these places. By offering instantaneous conversions and integrating into existing payment infrastructure, Bychkov hopes to remove this friction.

Embily is available here

The company also argues that far fewer people are using Bitcoin to buy goods and services than most crypto enthusiasts believe. Despite the fact that there are more than 7.7 billion people living on Earth according to the most current estimates, a recent study by the analytics firm Chainalysis found that just 1.3% of transactions came from merchants between January and April 2019.

Embily hopes to help build these circulation figures higher — emboldening crypto enthusiasts to buy dinner, pay for their parking and purchase in-game extras with ease. Its infrastructure is being offered on a white-label basis, meaning that the underlying technology can be used by crypto businesses that want to expand their reach and make life more convenient for their user base. Wallets and exchanges are listed among the types of platforms who could benefit.

Over time, this could help cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin make the transition from being regarded as a store of value to a means of exchange. It could also help demystify coins and tokens in the eyes of the public, who often regard digital currencies as complicated and high-risk. If the process of topping up and spending crypto is as simple as making a deposit in a bank, it could remove a barrier to entry that has been holding millions of people back — and even help regulators, including those who believe that BTC and ETH aren’t real currencies, begin to appreciate their value and place in society.

Citing unnamed local sources, The Block says that local police have shut down Binance’s offices after raiding the premises. Between 50–100 of the exchange’s employees reportedly worked out of the Shanghai location.

Binance has not responded to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment as of press time.

Closure follows crackdown

The purported raid follows a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities in the country.

Recently, financial authorities in China issued a notice to the public, directing individuals to report businesses engaged in virtual asset trading to the Shanghai headquarters of the People's Bank of China — the country’s central bank. Activities that must be reported include:

“Virtual currency transactions in the territory; the other is to issue ‘xx coins’ and ‘xx’ in the form of ‘blockchain application scenarios.’ Currency, fundraising or bitcoin, virtual currency such as Ethereum; third, providing services such as publicity, diversion, agency trading, etc. for registered ICO projects, virtual currency trading platforms, etc.”

However, Binance told Cointelegraph that the company had not received this notice. Similarly, Beijing-founded Huobi told Cointelegraph that the company was familiar with the notice, but had not received it.

Offices are an outdated concept?

In a move of regulatory arbitrage, Binance opened offices in Malta in 2018 as the island nation ramped up its cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory projects.

Last month, rumors abounded that the exchange was opening offices in the Chinese capital of Beijing, despite the country’s decidedly anti-cryptocurrency stance.

However, according to the firm’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, offices themselves are an antiquated concept. In a tweet on Nov. 19, Zhao said, “Office and HQ are old concepts like SMS and MMS. Time is moving on…”

Markets react with major coins seeing red

Cryptocurrency markets have reacted to the news, with most major coins seeing significant losses on the day.

Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing losses over 6% while leading altcoin Ether (ETH) has lost over 8% in the last 24 hours. Altcoins like Litecoin (LTC) and EOS are taking a beating with over 9% losses, while Binance’s own coin, Binance Coin (BNB), is down 10% at press time to trade at $16.58.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/paypal-ceo-hodls-bitcoin-and-only-bitcoin,"Dan Schulman, CEO of payment processor PayPal, revealed during an interview that he does indeed own Bitcoin (BTC).

On Nov. 20, Fortune reported that PayPal CEO Dan Schulman stopped by its offices where he discussed a variety of topics, including the reason for PayPal’s withdrawal from the Libra Association and whether he is the proud owner of any cryptocurrencies.

PayPal was the first to leave Libra

Schulman explained that PayPal withdrew from Libra because the company decided to put its attention elsewhere. According to the CEO it was a question of “where do we want to put our attention, and what do we want to do today to advance our mission?” He added:

“You know, we think if we focus on our own roadmap, we’d be able to advance financial inclusion faster than if we put all these resources against Libra.”

Schulman added that Libra will start going down a road that his company remains “very interested in looking at,” and once Libra starts to figure things out, “we’ll take another look at where they are.”

At the beginning of October, a PayPal spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the company had officially left the association, adding that they remain supportive of Libra’s aspirations and continue to look forward to dialogue on ways to work together in the future.

A lot of promise to blockchain technology

PayPal’s CFO John Rainey said in May that the firm has teams that are working on blockchain and cryptocurrency, and that they wish to participate in that technology in whatever form it takes in the future.

In the Fortune interview, Schulman was reluctant to share any significant details as to what exactly PayPal is working on in the sphere, although he was quick to point out that it is not “necessarily competitive with Libra,” adding:

“We think there’s a lot of promise to blockchain technology. It’s intriguing to us, but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails can’t do. Most people think that blockchain is about efficiency, but the system today is pretty efficient.”

Regarding cryptocurrencies, the CEO said that it is still very volatile, and that they do not have much demand for it by merchants because merchants operate on very small margins. He said:

“Until it becomes less volatile, it won’t be a currency that is widely accepted by merchants on the web — not the dark web, but the web.”

As to whether he owns any cryptocurrencies himself, Schulman’s answer was short and straightforward:",,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-cryptocurrency-plunges-below-8000-7-days-declines-2019-11-1028707587,"Reuters

Bitcoin plunged below $8,000 on Thursday, hitting its lowest level in nearly a month.

The biggest cryptocurrency has dropped for seven straight days as investors funneled money into stocks, bonds, gold, and other assets.

Bitcoin plunged below $8,000 on Thursday, hitting its lowest level in nearly a month.

The biggest cryptocurrency has dropped for seven straight days as investors have funneled money into mainstream assets.

""Volumes are low, no new money is coming into the ecosystem, and stocks/bonds/gold are all up double-digits year-to-date, which makes the non-crypto world lose focus on this emerging asset class,"" Jeff Dorman, the head of investment at asset manager Arca, told Bloomberg.

""The downward pressure is being caused by a divergence of investment strategy across all asset classes, which has created indecision and cautiousness,"" Luno CEO Marcus Swanepoel wrote in a note earlier this week.

Mainstream rejection of cryptocurrencies could also be fueling the sell-off. Chinese regulators are cracking down on companies trading digital currencies, and Chinese social-media giant Weibo banned crypto giants Binance and Tron, according to Bloomberg.

PayPal's former president and tech investor Roelof Botha said Bank of America closed his account with ""absolutely no explanation,"" sparking conspiracies he was banned for trading cryptocurrencies. Moreover, R3 CEO David Rutter reportedly said Facebook's rollout of its Libra digital coin was ""ridiculously stupid.""

Bitcoin was down about 2.5% at $7,900 at the time of writing — a sharp decline from the $13,000 mark it hit in late June, and a fraction of its all-time high of around $20,000.

According to an announcement published on Nov. 21, users will be able to use Indian rupees (INR) to buy and sell crypto via the Binance Fiat Gateway as early as Nov. 25.

Major morale boost for the Indian community

During the first quarter of 2020, WazirX’s auto-matching engine will be integrated into the Binance Fiat Gateway so that Binance.com users will be able to directly place orders on the flagship exchange to purchase Tether (USDT) against INR. With this integration, any crypto tradeable on Binance.com will become accessible for those who purchase USDT via WazirX.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Kashif Raza — co-founder of the Indian crypto regulatory news and analysis platform “Crypto Kanoon” — welcomed the development, suggesting that the acquisition will provide a major morale boost to the Indian startup space at a time of deep regulatory uncertainty.

This uncertainty is highly likely to have played a role in WazirX’s decision to join forces with a major industry incumbent like Binance, he added.

Back in July 2018 — in the aftermath of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) controversial ban on banks' dealings with crypto-related firms — WazirX had transformed its business model into a P2P platform so as to avoid in-house crypto-fiat conversion.

Other exchanges, like Coindelta, have since been forced to terminate services altogether in light of the adverse operating climate for crypto businesses in the country

“Another step forward in achieving the freedom of money”

In a statement, Binance Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhou remarked that “building fiat-to-crypto bridges remain a key mission for Binance,” adding that the acquisition of WazirX will help Binance in this mission “by providing a simple and cohesive way to purchase cryptocurrencies in a country which is home to more than a billion people.""

Binance’s chief executive Changpeng Zhao has said the move represents “another step forward in achieving the freedom of money.”

As reported, the Indian government recently revealed it has opted not to introduce a draft bill on a potential cryptocurrency ban to parliament in the coming winter session.

The draft bill — entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency & Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” — reportedly intends not only to impose a complete ban on the use of crypto in India but also to pave the way for a “Digital Rupee” issued by the Reserve Bank of India.

In late October, Binance launched support for deposits in Nigerian Naira (NGN), announcing that they would add support for fiat trading earlier that month, starting with the Russian ruble.

In mid-October, it launched p2p trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and USDT against the Chinese yuan and this month added support for the Turkish lira on its flagship exchange.

To date, Binance has also launched four international crypto-fiat exchanges, including Binance Uganda, European trading platform Binance Jersey, Binance Singapore and Binance US.",,https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/11/21/131869/can-photonic-chips-save-bitcoin/,"When the Bitcoin bubble burst at the end of 2017, the cryptocurrency’s value dropped from over $17,000 to less than $7,000 in just a few days. Global news coverage suggested that the currency boom appeared to have ended abruptly.

But as Bitcoin’s value dropped, something strange happened. The rate at which bitcoins were being created—or mined—increased dramatically. The reason? Despite the fall in value, bitcoin mining was still extremely profitable. In other words, the cost of mining—the price of the hardware plus the energy to run it—was still less than the value of the coins it produced.

This mining boom continued for almost a year. Then in November 2018, Bitcoin’s value dropped dramatically again, this time from about $6,500 to less than $3,500.

This pulled the rug from under many miners. Suddenly bitcoins were no longer valuable enough to cover their energy costs and the mines were shuttered. For the first time in the cryptocurrency’s history, the rate of mining collapsed, falling from 60 exa-hashes per second to just 35.

The impact was significant. Before this, mining had been geographically diverse, preventing one country or region from exerting undue influence. Now mining was possible only where energy was cheap enough to allow a profit—mainly in western China. And China was increasing its scrutiny of cryptocurrencies, shutting exchanges and banning various activities.

This posed an existential threat to Bitcoin. And ever since, cryptocurrency experts have been desperately looking for a fix.

The fundamental issue is that bitcoin mining is computationally expensive. This is a deliberate ploy to make the cryptocurrency secure. But computation is energy intensive. And as interest in the cryptocurrency has increased, so has the amount of energy it uses up.

By some estimates, bitcoin mining currently consumes over 75 terawatt-hours per year, more than the entire electricity consumption of Austria. That’s not sustainable, particularly if Bitcoin continues to grow exponentially, as the cryptocurrency community hopes. So a new way to mine the currency is desperately needed.

Enter Michael Dubrovsky at the nonprofit PoWx, Marshall Ball at Columbia University in New York, and Bogdan Penkovsky at the University of Paris-Saclay in France. These guys have come up with a new way to secure Bitcoin that is computationally expensive but much more energy efficient. Crucially, they say it is also compatible with the current encryption systems and so should be relatively straightforward to include in future iterations of Bitcoin.

Their secret sauce is simple. Instead of relying on conventional computers to do the number crunching, Dubrovksy and co want to use optical computers. They say these devices use significantly less energy and so will fundamentally change the calculus behind bitcoin mining. But are they right?

First some background. Bitcoin is based on a decentralized ledger that records all transactions associated with the currency. This ensures that no single entity controls the currency.

A key idea is that the ledger must be secure so that everyone can trust its contents. This security is achieved by regularly encrypting the ledger so that its content cannot be changed.

The encryption process must have special properties, however. The ledger must be extremely hard to encrypt, but once encrypted, it must be easy to check.

It turns out that there are a set of mathematical objects called trapdoor functions that have exactly this property. Indeed, they are already widely used for encrypting everything from personal messages to credit card transactions.

This form of encryption is computationally expensive—it requires powerful computers that are costly to run. So Bitcoin has another feature that has been key to its success. Anybody who performs the encryption process—the proof of work—is rewarded with newly created bitcoins.

That’s why the process is called mining. As the value of Bitcoin has increased, the popularity of mining has increased too.

But this has a downside. Computation is energy intensive. So miners have looked for various ways of reducing their costs. One development was the introduction of application-specific integrated circuits—ASIC chips—that are optimized for the single purpose of Bitcoin mining. Another was to find cheap sources of energy.

Dubrovksy and co say optical computing changes this calculus. They are inspired by the rapid development in recent years of photonic chips that can compute with much greater efficiency than silicon. “The promise of the technology, is to offer 2-3 orders of magnitude better energy efficiency over electronic processors,” say the team.

To that end, Dubrovksy and co have come up with a revised encryption protocol, called HeavyHash, that is optimized for photonic computers. This means the best results can be achieved only by employing a photonic processor to do the number crunching.

This “optical proof of work” should encourage the adoption of photonic chips and so dramatically reduce Bitcoin’s power budget. “The implementation of optical Proof of Work will help accelerate the development of energy-efficient photonic co-processors,” say the researchers.

When the cost of energy is no longer the main consideration, Dubrovsky and co say, the cost of hardware will dominate the calculations. And that will ensure that miners can work profitably in locations all over the globe rather than only in regions where energy is cheap.

At least, that’s the theory. The problem is that the power efficiency of photonic chips has yet to be clearly established. For example, optical switches work by changing their refractive index, and this is currently done with tiny heaters. Silicon photonic circuits also vary in small ways that must be compensated for with microheaters.

These heaters significantly increase the power budget of the chips in ways that are hard to anticipate. Indeed, Dubrovksy and co do not clearly predict the power savings that may (or may not) be possible as Bitcoin scales. That makes it hard to assess the efficacy of optical proof of work.

Neither do the researchers show how optical proof of work will solve the problem associated with regional differences in the cost of power. In future the hardware costs will be similar for all miners, as they are now. So, in the long term, the best way to maximize profits will still be to find cheap sources of energy.

That’s no different from the problem Bitcoin is currently facing. Which is why it’s hard to escape the conclusion that this form of energy-efficient computing merely postpones the inevitable.

What followed was the very opposite of what the Argentine government had anticipated — over the past two weeks, the country has traded the highest amount of Bitcoins on the peer-to-peer platform LocalBitcoins, according to data by CoinDance.

Argentina’s fragile economy

One of the biggest factors in the high adoption of crypto in the country is the high volatility of the Argentine peso. In just the past five years, the value of the peso against the United States dollar has fallen by over 85%. The residents of the country have traditionally had little confidence in their currency, favoring to convert their spare pesos into relatively stable dollars.

The country’s sovereign currency is the peso, which people earn and spend, but it’s the U.S. dollar that defines the value of goods and services. The peso–dollar exchange rate is quoted daily by the media, alongside weather and traffic reports.

Looking at the economic situation of Argentina, crypto bull Tim Draper advised the president of Argentina in March 2019 to legalize Bitcoin in order to improve the country’s economic situation. He counseled the president on crypto’s potential to improve the devaluation of the Argentine peso and relieve the associated brain drain.

Daniel Popa, CEO of the Anchor stablecoin, told Cointelegraph that despite the volatility of crypto, Argentinians trust it more as a store of value than the peso because Bitcoin cannot be manipulated by the government, adding that:

“Unfortunately, bitcoin does not offer predictability, underlining the ongoing need for a universally-accepted stablecoin and financial standard that could be adopted by anyone in the world, including those suffering from the negative economic impacts that stem from war, natural disasters, health crises, and disruptive monetary policies.”

Crackdown on forex

To give some historical context, in the 1990s, the peso was pegged to the dollar by the government of President Carlos Menem in an attempt to stifle inflation. The dollar peg damaged exports, pushing the state to take on more debt to remain afloat amid a worsening economic crisis. The peg was lifted in 2002. However, the dollar had already been ingrained in Argentine culture.

On Sept. 1, the Central Bank of Argentina had imposed restrictions on U.S. dollar purchases to revive the plunging peso. Citizens’ purchases made in dollars were limited to $10,000 a month, requiring special permissions beyond that limit. The bank also said it would restrict dollar purchases to $200 per month via bank account and just $100 per month in cash, until December.

Talking to Cointelegraph about the government’s crackdown on forex, Salomon Ptit Haddad, the head of institutional sales at Enigma Securities, said, “Given the current degree of uncertainty, the BCRA board of directors decided to take a series of measures that seek to preserve the reserves of the Central Bank.” Haddad went on to add:

“The Argentine Central Bank can easily impose restrictive measures on the use of bank cards, with local banks having to comply with the guidelines imposed by the country’s central bank. Argentina, which has a $50 billion debt to the IMF and is trying to get out of the economic problems it is facing.”

Ban on crypto purchase with credit card

Keeping up with the trend to increase the adoption of peso, the Central Bank of Argentina announced on Oct. 31 that citizens are prohibited from using credit cards to buy cryptocurrencies. Haddad believes that this regulatory policy is aimed at protecting the national currency at the cost of crypto, since Argentine citizens tend to exchange crypto back into the dollar either offshore or in the country.

He also added that since November this year, the BCA has mandated all card issuers to be registered prior to distributing new cards, “This has generated great uncertainty within the South American country, where it is customary to have cash and dispense with banking systems.” Haddad went on to add:

“Now, after this measure, the cryptocurrencies can be a way to preserve assets for those who want to save, bearing in mind that the origin of people looking for a stronger asset is the devaluation of the local currency, which has been devalued by 50% so far this year.”

We have seen it time and again in countries like India and China, where crypto trading volumes surge upward following a ban. Talking about how this move led to an increased interest in crypto, the co-founder and chief operations officer at ShapeShift exchange, who simply goes by “Jon,” said:

“Capital controls seem to have a direct correlation with getting people more interested in Bitcoin because it’s something the government can’t control. The population of the country sees these capital controls are put in place and then they’re going to look for a way around it. That’s where Bitcoin and crypto come in, as they give a good way to store and transfer values when they’re dealing with this type of uncertainty.”

Institutional help in adoption

Argentina’s deputy minister of finance, Felix Martin Soto, claimed in March this year that the government should approach crypto and blockchain tech as a way to improve Argentina’s financial inclusion and reduce state costs.

He had also asserted that promoting the crypto industry in the nation will serve to reduce its demand for dollars, which will ultimately commit to preserving the local market and attracting global investment.

Soto is not the only one who is pro-crypto. Upon being elected in 2015, President Mauricio Macri was perceived to be good news for the legal status of Bitcoin in the country. He was the one to sponsor the First Bitcoin Forum in Buenos Aires in July 2015. Although, his enthusiasm for cryptos didn’t seem to last for too long. Jon gave two reasons as to why the president slowed his fondness toward crypto:

“1) It’s hard to focus on Bitcoin regulation while trying to keep the government stable and national currency inflation down so people can afford to live; and 2) he’s probably running into bureaucratic pushback for various reasons.”

Apart from the forum, there have been other initiatives by organizations to spread crypto awareness. For example, nonprofit organizations Bitcoin Argentina and Bitcoin Americana launched an informational campaign called “Bitcoineta.” It consisted of a Bitcoin-branded van, jointly purchased by the two organizations, that went around Argentina to spread basic knowledge about cryptocurrencies among local communities.

A need for regulation, not restriction

2018’s edition of G-20, which was coincidently held in Argentina, mentioned crypto regulation. The officials stated their concerns regarding the crypto industry as well as their overall agenda for both the future and infrastructure development of the participating nations.

The conclusion of the summit saw a declaration titled, “Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development,” which regards cryptocurrencies as an important part of an “open and resilient financial system” that “is crucial to support sustainable growth.”

The document also highlights the necessities of Anti-Money Laundering and anti-terrorist measures as per the standards of the Financial Action Task Force, providing clear instructions to participating nations on crypto regulation.

However, Argentina itself didn’t make much of an effort to regulate digital assets. The Argentine government has not implemented specific regulations on exchange, issuance or — in general — the use of digital assets. Regarding the Argentine government’s failure to take swift action on the regulatory front, Shapeshift’s Jon said:

“It’s hard to fully know why that didn’t happen, but my best guess is that the crypto regulation discussion got caught up in bureaucratic priorities. Unless the government, any government, really makes something a priority, other things just take precedence. I doubt there’s specific intent around not regulating crypto, rather it’s something they’ve just not gotten to yet.”

Argentina is the textbook example of how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can find a use as a store of value, especially in economically vulnerable nations. If the government is serious about reducing their dependence on the U.S. dollar, it is becoming more apparent that they should embrace and understand crypto. Early adoption of digital currencies could help the country come out of its financial downturn.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/new-bill-would-make-facebooks-cryptocurrency-a-security-under-the-law.html,"Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee on ""An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors"" in the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, DC on October 23, 2019.

A bipartisan team of senators introduced a bill Thursday that would make Facebook's cryptocurrency libra a security under the law. That classification would likely invite even greater regulation and scrutiny to the project, which Facebook has insisted is a digital payments system.

Two members of the House Financial Services Committee, Reps. Sylvia Garcia, D-Tex., and Lance Gooden, R-Tex., proposed the ""Managed Stablecoins are Securities Act of 2019"" on the day of a committee hearing on the role of big data in financial services. Garcia explicitly called out libra in a statement announcing the bill, saying that it and other managed stablecoins ""are clearly securities under existing law.""

""Bringing clarity to the regulatory structure of these digital assets protects consumers and ensures proper government oversight going forward,"" Garcia said in the statement.

Gooden said the bill is necessary to help consumers understand the financial assets they are buying.

""In what are called 'managed stablecoins', we have trusted brands marketing digital assets to consumers as secure and stable,"" Gooden said in a statement. ""Everyday investors need to know they can trust the issuers behind their financial assets. This bill would bring them the security they deserve by applying the laws we use to regulate financial securities to this new breed of digital currencies.""

Facebook and the Libra Association, the group that will govern the cryptocurrency, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Facebook has consistently pushed back on the notion that libra is a security under the law. Asked what exactly a libra is at a congressional hearing in July, Facebook's crypto chief David Marcus said it would be somewhat akin to PayPal in certain transactions and denied it is a security or exchange-traded fund.

It makes sense for Facebook to avoid having libra categorized as a security, which would introduce a host of regulatory hurdles. The company has committed to not being a part of any launch of libra without U.S. regulators' approval. Asked by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., at an October hearing about which regulators Facebook would engage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is committed to getting all appropriate approvals from regulators who have jurisdiction over libra.

Facebook has argued that the cryptocurrency would be relatively stable because it will be backed by a basket of currencies including the U.S. dollar. The company has worked to distinguish libra from securities and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Speaking at The New York Times DealBook Conference earlier this month, Marcus said he thinks of Bitcoin as ""digital gold"" rather than a currency, adding that it's likely avoided some regulation because it's not seen as a medium of exchange.

Garcia and Gooden both questioned Zuckerberg on libra at the committee hearing back in October. Garcia was among the congresspeople calling for Zuckerberg's testimony over his deputies, believing ""he would be the one to have the answers"" on libra, but walked away from the hearing feeling ""disappointed.""

WATCH: Facebook's libra head: I don't see bitcoin as currency, it's digital gold",2019-11-21,https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-84-of-q3-interest-came-from-non-crypto-hedge-funds,"Grayscale’s Michael Sonnenshein contends that the asset manager’s recent Form 10 filing with American regulators would be “a milestone” for the crypto industry if it’s approved.

Sonnenshein — managing director at the world’s largest digital asset manager, Grayscale Investments — made his remarks during an interview with CNBC on Nov. 20.

Hedge funds after digital asset exposure

Earlier this week, Grayscale filed a registration statement on Form 10 for its publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

If approved, the trust would become the first cryptocurrency investment vehicle to attain the status of a reporting company by the SEC. In his interview with CNBC, Sonnenshein noted the robust institutional interest in cryptocurrency access products. Even just in Q3 2019, he said:

“84% of inflows were from non-crypto hedge funds that want digital asset exposure.”

GBTC has been trading since May 2015 and Sonnenshein noted that “if we just look at the last 3-month trading volume, it’s tripled year-over-year,” regardless of Bitcoin’s performance on the spot markets.

Regarding the significance of the SEC potentially giving the green light to Grayscale’s Form 10 filing, Sonnenshein said:

“You have a lot of companies that want to have exposure to the space, but then you start to ask, who at the company is going to have the keys? Who at the company is going to do the due diligence and the ongoing compliance?”

Aside from compliance benefits, he emphasized the importance of creating a family of products that “look and feel like many of the other instruments these institutions use.”

Halving, not institutions, will drive Bitcoin’s price

The takeaway, he suggested, is that if Form 10 is deemed to be effective, we’ll see for the first time “greater access for institutions who need an SEC reporting company to be able to invest” and “quicker liquidity options, so that investors can divulge their holdings after six, as opposed to twelve, months.”

Regarding any potential impact on Bitcoin’s price, Sonnenshein discarded the institutional investor adoption narrative and emphasized instead Bitcoin’s forthcoming halving — and consequent diminishment of supply — as a factor that has historically shown itself to have a positive impact on the asset’s price.

As reported, Grayscale’s regulatory foray follows a record year for the trust, which saw inflows of $254 million in total investment into its products in the third quarter of 2019.",,,,

In a statement on Nov. 21, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) warned it was taking action against entities allegedly involved in trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC).

PBoC: Exchanges “will be disposed of immediately”

The move was in response to a rise in trading activity following China’s public endorsement of blockchain technology, it said.

Pledging to keep its promise to outlaw trading, the PBoC vowed to “dispose of” any such activity it discovered under its jurisdiction.

“Once it is discovered, it will be disposed of immediately, and it will be prevented from happening early,” a translation of the statement reads.

As Cointelegraph reported, multiple rumors currently abound about a crackdown on legitimate cryptocurrency businesses’ Chinese outposts. On Thursday, attention focused on alleged police raids on the offices of Binance and Bithumb, something both subsequently denied.

Bitcoin tanked on Friday as the news appeared to rattle markets, sliding almost 10% and bouncing off support at around $7,000.

Blockchain not Bitcoin

Meanwhile, the city of Shenzhen revealed an investigation into similar cryptocurrency trading operations, again spearheaded by the PBoC. Commentators, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, nonetheless argued the focus of the probe genuinely was bad actors, and that it would ultimately be beneficial.

In the latest statement, however, the PBoC underscored the official government position in favor of blockchain but against cryptocurrency more clearly than ever.

“Investors should be careful not to mix blockchain technology with virtual currency,” it continued, paraphrasing similar warnings that appeared in government media publication People’s Daily late last month.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-idUSKBN1XW1CO,"LONDON (Reuters) - Bitcoin slumped to a six-month low on Friday after China’s central bank launched a fresh crackdown on cryptocurrencies, warning of the risks entailed in issuing or trading them.

Bitcoin BTC=BTSP, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, fell 9% to $6,929, its lowest since May, and was last down 7% at $7,107.

The People’s Bank of China’s Shanghai headquarters said it would tackle growing cases of illegality involving virtual currencies. It also cautioned investors not to confuse crypto with blockchain technology, the digital ledger that underpins many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

The move came a day after regulators in Shenzhen launched a similar campaign, and came as the PBOC prepares to launch its own digital currency.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that the world’s second-biggest economy should accelerate the development of blockchain technology.

Bitcoin, known for its wild price swings, soared over 40% in two days after Xi’s remarks, with investors betting that Beijing’s backing of blockchain and plans for a digital renminbi would accelerate the mainstream embrace of cryptocurrencies.

But since late October bitcoin has slumped by nearly a third.

Jamie Farquhar, portfolio manager at London-based crypto firm NKB Group, said the PBOC statement crystallized a growing sense among crypto investors that China’s embrace of blockchain would be unlikely to include cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

“It’s the realization that the positivity over Xi’s blockchain announcement was exaggerated,” he said. “It may not include bitcoin at this point.”",2019-11-22 12:30:16+00:00,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-cryptocurrency-market-crash-a9213426.html,"The price of bitcoin and several other major cryptocurrencies have dropped dramatically over the last 24 hours, wiping billions from their value.

Bitcoin fell by more than 10 per cent to take its price below $7,400 (£5,700) for the first time since May, with no sign of the current crash slowing down.

Ethereum, ripple, bitcoin cash and ripple all saw losses of between 5 and 15 per cent over the last day.

Cryptocurrency analysts struggled to explain the sudden crash but said further losses should not be ruled out.

The market movement comes in stark contrast to bitcoin's generally positive year-to-date, which has seen it rise from below $4,000 in January 2019.

Recent positive developments in the cryptocurrency space had some investors hoping that bitcoin would continue to see gains, especially after both China and the EU appeared to endorse the notion of blockchain-backed digital currency.

Last month Chinese president Xi Jinping described it as an ""important breakthrough"", prompting a state-run newspaper to publish a front-page story about the success of bitcoin.

It came after years of China taking a hardline stance towards the industry and comes amid rumours that the country is preparing to launch its own cryptocurrency next year.

One possible explanation for bitcoin's mysterious crash could be further developments in China that saw a fresh crackdown on illegal exchanges.

The country's public endorsement of cryptocurrency seemed to fuel an increase in trading activity on illicit platforms, resulting in a response from the People's Bank of China.",2019-11-22 12:17:53+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/friday-shows-bloodbath-for-crypto-markets-bitcoin-price-at-7-300,"Friday, Nov. 22 — Cryptocurrency prices are bleeding heavily, with some of the top-20 coins showing losses of close to 10% on the day.

Bitcoin (BTC) started the day just above the $7,600 price mark, when it suddenly started on another sell-off towards the $7,000 price level. The coin bounced off a local low of $6,800 in recent hours, before moving up to its current trading price at $7,300, showing a loss of close to 4% on the day.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency is down around 15% from the weekly open of $8,500 and has dragged the entire crypto market into red territory.

BTC could be testing below the $7,000 price mark

Popular crypto analyst and regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb recently said that after looking at the daily chart, “it is clear that Bitcoin has hit the bottom of the downward channel in which it has been trading since July.”

However, Filb Filb pointed out that the price point of $7,600 will be a key level for the bulls to reclaim, which might turn out to be a challenge, especially in the short term. He said:

“Probability would suggest BTC/USD will need to spend a little more time testing below $7,000 before there is a significant bullish reversal.”

Previously Cointelegraph reported that Bitcoin tanked due to the multiple rumors currently going around about a crackdown on legitimate Chinese outposts of cryptocurrency businesses. The news appeared to rattle the crypto markets, which slipped into a downwards spiral ever since.

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, saw a painful drop in sync with BTC earlier today. The number one altcoin bounced of its daily low at $141, showing double-digit losses of more than 10% on the day, before moving up to its current trading price of $154 per coin.

For those long involved in the crypto space, it’s easy to forget just how overwhelming and mystifying the world of bitcoin was when first encountered as a fresh-faced neophyte, unable to tell the difference between a bitcoin and a blockchain, or even what a private key was. In that interest, it stands to examine 7 common myths surrounding the permissionless digital asset, to help disperse some of the troublesome fog that can obscure the true nature of crypto for beginners.

The Nature of Myths

Myths and works of fiction aren’t powerful unless they contain some element of truth in them, or point to some deeper reality. In much the same way, myths and common misconceptions surrounding bitcoin and crypto often find their basis in real life situations or partial truths, leading to confusion down the road for those who don’t have the informational tools to sort out the difference. This post seeks to provide some of these tools.

Common Bitcoin Myths and Misconceptions

1. Bitcoin Is Anonymous

Whether one is talking about bitcoin core (BTC), or bitcoin cash (BCH), which was forked from BTC in 2017 to preserve the original vision of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is not anonymous. Using a simple tool called a block explorer or other analysis software, any and all bitcoin transactions can be viewed publicly. Indeed, part of the strength of bitcoin is its virtually immutable transparency which can prevent fraud, theft and third party tampering.

A bitcoin transaction is very different from a traditional bank or credit card transaction. The sender and receiver’s names are not used, but a random string of characters called a bitcoin address. In this sense, bitcoin is pseudonymous. Anonymizing protocols which shuffle coins or reroute and encrypt web traffic can also be used to further obscure transaction details. In short, bitcoin can be pretty private and nearly anonymous, but it takes some work.

2. Bitcoin and Blockchain Are the Same

Blockchain is just a buzzword for a digital ledger or record of information. Bitcoin transactions are recorded and secured on the bitcoin blockchain by miners. These miners are individuals or groups who use specialized computing power to solve complex mathematical puzzles which serve to create blocks of verified transactions. Miners receive built-in bitcoin rewards for doing this work.

While the bitcoin network is decentralized and permissionless, meaning anyone can use it freely, running their own node and verifying the blockchain for themselves, other networks such as those of businesses, governments and banks feature centralized blockchains, whose records or digital currencies are stored at central servers, and are only viewable and usable by approved parties. Bitcoin points to a specific network and currency utilizing blockchain technology. Bitcoin in and of itself is not synonymous with this technology.

3. Nothing ‘Backs’ It

U.S. President Donald Trump famously quipped back in July that bitcoin is “based on thin air,” but he overlooked a critical economic reality: so is everything. Because value is ultimately subjective in nature, markets are free to value what they will, how they will, and when they will. This is how the cowry shells of ancient times came to be money, and gold as well.

A currency which has great market utility eases the problems inherent to barter and is viewed as as a highly saleable good in an economy. Bitcoin’s fast speeds, low fees and lack of centralized oversight give it a cutting edge which causes people to ascribe value to it “out of thin air.” The paper dollar bills filling our wallets have value simply because everyone is forced to use them, and thus “agrees” to do so, while the government continues to print them out of the same thin air, devaluing the currency. At least in bitcoin’s case, the supply is limited to 21 million.

4. Bitcoin Is Money for Criminals

Statistically, the overwhelming majority of crime is facilitated by the U.S. dollar and fiat currencies, not bitcoin.

5. Bitcoin Is a ‘Get Rich Quick’ Scheme

As noted at the outset of this article, there’s a little bit of truth to every lie, and there’s no use pretending the world of cryptocurrency isn’t rife with snake oil scams and pyramid schemes. Especially as very real and significant amounts of value can be made by traders and holders of the currency. That said, there’s nothing about bitcoin itself that could be conceived as a “scam” because it’s only a decentralized network of users, developers, nodes and miners, and not an organization.

Scammy groups and companies may try to leverage the network and currency to their advantage, just as con artists leverage credit card numbers and bank account information for their own, but bitcoin itself is just a tool that has nothing to do with these bad actors.

6. Only Tech-Savvy People Can Use It

With all the specialized jargon, alien-looking public and private keys, crypto Twitter drama and talk of hash rates and halvenings, it’s easy to see why entering the world of cryptocurrency might be daunting for a newcomer. That said, getting started can be simple as downloading an easy-to-use wallet such as Bitcoin.com’s own wallet app, and visiting a faucet to receive some free bitcoin cash (BCH).

Sending and receiving bitcoin is as easy as copying and pasting an address, or scanning a QR code. Even business owners are finding that adoption is easy, and they don’t have to know anything about Satoshi, Schnorr Signatures or cryptoanarchy to enjoy the benefits of quick, low-fee, permissionless cash.

7. Bitcoin Is an Organization or Centralized Group

As stated above, bitcoin isn’t a company like Visa or Paypal. It’s not an investment firm, MLM group or a broker. Bitcoin is a network and a cryptocurrency. The network is decentralized, enabled and secured by independent actors worldwide who run nodes — keeping a record of the entire blockchain themselves — mine blocks, develop software and make transactions, creating the market. In this sense, it’s really quite a wonder of modern technology, comparable, according to some, to the advent of the internet. Anyone who doubts the protocol’s structure is free to audit the open source code directly, as nothing is hidden. Further, nothing can be centrally altered.

Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash

Hopefully, this short venture into the world of bitcoin has cleared a few things up for the crypto curious. If you’re of the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto, looking for “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,” bitcoin may be for you.

National tax agencies have recently made it clear that the long arms of the law will be wielded to ensure bitcoiners pay the appropriate tax on their earnings. Motivated by surging interest in crypto, authorities are cracking the whip and instilling fear in those who have, until now, dismissed the notion that they might be pursued for tax on their trading.

A Taxonomy of Crypto Tax Requirements

Quantifying gains and losses on cryptocurrency purchases, and determining which transactions are liable to tax (and which kind of tax), has long been a challenge for individuals operating in this space. Compounded their dilemma was a complete lack of direction from authorities, which have been slow to develop an understanding of the cryptosphere and tighten their regulations accordingly. In light of recently published guidance, and the spate of ensuing news coverage, however, anyone found to be willfully dodging tax cannot reasonably claim ignorance of their obligations.

Which isn’t to say that managing your crypto tax affairs is now a walk in the park – far from it. The complexities of hard forks, token sales, airdrops, mining and the heterogeneous nature of exchanges (property for crypto, BTC for ETH etc) throw up no end of questions, and every country has its own rules. Figuring out the tax due on your crypto transactions over the course of a year, particularly if you are a busy investor, can be a bit like trying to solve a riddle wrapped inside an enigma, concealed within a conundrum.

Maintain Accurate Transaction Records

To summarize: if you have bought, sold, sent or received digital currency in recent years, you should have been maintaining comprehensive records of your activity. It’s impossible to know just what percentage of cryptocurrency holders have dotted their i’s and crossed their t’s, but given that the IRS recently mailed over 10,000 letters warning of stiff penalties for those who fail to pay tax on their transactions, the suspicion is: not all. Not even close.

And blatant evasion isn’t the only reason for that. Another is that, historically speaking, many accountants have been unwilling to familiarize themselves with crypto-accounting directives. That’s why, in the last few years, an entirely new subset of accountancy firms have entered the market, targeting the crypto niche. Specialist software such as cryptocurrency tax calculators and automated accounting programs have also appeared, promising to help you report gains and losses more accurately.

While working out tax due on crypto investments is tricky, record-keeping itself isn’t. It’s mainly laborious and punishingly dull – a matter of faithfully recording the date and time each crypto asset is acquired, its market value at the time, the date and time each asset is sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of, the market value of each unit when it is sold, exchanged or disposed of, and the value received for each unit. Better start populating a spreadsheet.

As with any transactional enterprise, consistent, accurate record-keeping will stand you in good stead when it’s time to file your tax return. Don’t leave it until the last minute.

How Crypto Tax Software Can Simplify the Process

Traditional accounting systems simply aren’t equipped to deal with virtual currencies, which are famously volatile and differ in key ways from fiat money. Maintaining accurate accounts, therefore, requires a lot of legwork if you assume the burden yourself.

As mentioned, hiring a specialist senior tax accountant or utilizing crypto tax software can help you navigate the daunting landscape and satisfy the circling wolves. Most tracking programs allow you to import CSV files of your trades direct from exchanges, and review real-time dashboards so you can track your obligations from month to month. Accountants, meanwhile, can negotiate with tax agencies on your behalf to resolve any queries or disputes, and their experience may prove invaluable if your obligations encompass hundreds of trades across multiple platforms, involving disparate tokens. Even contemplating such reporting liabilities is enough to induce a headache.

With tax authorities now looking to work with exchanges to identify those who have bought and sold crypto, it’s time to start paying the piper if you haven’t already. Every single trade you make in the cryptosphere is likely to impact tax calculations in some way. Speak to a tax professional, invest in tracking and management software, or – providing your trading history is relatively straightforward – do it yourself. Godspeed.

On Nov. 22, authorities in Shenzhen have identified a total of 39 exchanges falling foul of China’s cryptocurrency trading ban, according to local news outlet Sanyan Finance.

PBoC highlights Bitcoin and Ethereum in probe

The operation reportedly included participation from China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the Economic Investigation Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Communications Administration.

It remains unknown what consequences the exchanges will face, with Sanyan highlighting a desire to crack down on liquidity.

A rough translation states the measures involve a three-pronged approach:

“It is reported that the action will focus on three activities: first, providing virtual currency trading services or opening virtual currency trading places in China; second, providing service channels for overseas virtual currency trading places, including services such as drainage and agency trading; Sell ​​tokens in various names, raise funds for investors or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

Cointelegraph previously noted the existence of the Shenzhen plans, which also target entities beyond the exchange sector.

No police raids took place, says Binance

As Cointelegraph reported, China continues to present a varied stance on cryptocurrency. After publicly voicing support for blockchain technology last month, Chinese media issued warnings not to confuse the policy for endorsement of phenomena such as Bitcoin.

This week, meanwhile, cryptocurrency exchange Binance denied rumors police had raided its office in Shanghai. Shortly afterward, fellow exchange Bithumb similarly rejected the idea it planned to close its Shanghai outpost, while Huobi stated likewise.

“We have heard of this from some media reports. However, we have not received any specific instructions at this point,” a Huobi representative said.

Commenting on the Shenzhen move, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhang praised what he saw as an effort to remove bad actors.

“This is actually a very good thing to happen, cleaning up the industry of scammers and fraudsters,” he wrote in response to PrimitiveCrypto’s founding partner, Dovey Wan.

Wan had claimed that the targets of the shutdown were “most likely are ponzi and crypto frauds as Shenzhen is known for being the hub of those.”",,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/the-strange-tale-of-quadriga-gerald-cotten,"“THE MERCY OF THE WAVES”

The smiling boy visited Sunnybrook Yachts in the summer of 2017, after the value of Bitcoin had reached an all-time high, having tripled in five months. Sunnybrook is the largest yacht brokerage on Canada’s east coast. Its clients tended to be surgeons and litigators and C-suiters who travel from Toronto and Paris and Hawaii to summer in Nova Scotia; their wives wear silks and Manolos and perfect fingernails that cost $300 yesterday at the salon. The smiling boy stood out. He wore a wrinkled golf shirt, cargo shorts, and beat-up Birkenstocks, and he was obscenely young, with sandy hair and pale skin that appeared not to have seen sunlight since puberty. He was accompanied by a girlfriend who drove her own Jeep. They struck the yacht salesman as a couple you’d less likely see at Scaramouche than in a Walmart parking lot. Most conspicuous was the odd way that the young man always seemed to be smiling. It was a gentle, unflappable smile. It put strangers at ease; it made him seem lighthearted. It was difficult to imagine that this particular trait was contrived, but later, after it was revealed that nearly everything about him was a work of pure contrivance, you had to wonder whether the incessant smiling was just another part of the act.

This summer day, however, he was dead serious. The smiling boy wanted a big boat.

“What’s your goal?” replied the yacht salesman, in the delicate manner of his trade. A yacht salesman never asked what customers were “looking to spend,” or whether they had ever been on a yacht, let alone knew how to operate one. He summoned a future in which the customer was already a proud captain astride a luxury pleasure vessel dividing a turquoise sea.

“I’d like a boat that I can cruise locally,” said the smiling boy, “and then take south.” He wanted to reach the Caribbean without having to stop in Canada or the United States.

That would require an extra fuel tank, the salesman explained, and a desalination system for drinking water. They settled on a customized Jeanneau 51 with a pink and cream interior: three cabins, a dining area for six, a dishwasher, a gas stove, a washer and dryer, an en suite bathroom with standing shower, and a swim platform with teak battens. When offered an electric motor for the life raft, the smiling boy gestured to his Tesla in the marina’s parking lot. “Sure,” he said. “I love electric.” The whole thing would cost $600,000, but expense never came up—only safety. He named his boat the Gulliver, after the traveler who trusted himself to the mercy of the waves and swam as fortune directed him.

Over several dozen hours of sailing lessons, the yacht dealer learned a few things about his customer. His name was Gerald Cotten, and he went by Gerry; his girlfriend was a property manager named Jennifer Robertson, or Jen; her two Chihuahuas, who liked to sun themselves on the deck as the Gulliver negotiated the islands and shoals of Mahone Bay, were Nitro and Gully. One of those bay islands—four acres of pine encircled by black sand—Cotten purchased that summer. He cleared trees and built a house, though he had no apparent plans to move in. The couple lived in a three-bedroom in Fall River, north of Halifax, a rich suburb only recently carved out of a forest near a long dark lake; Cotten owned a third home in Kelowna, in British Columbia’s wine country; a fourth in Calgary; and 14 rental properties in Nova Scotia, including, in Bedford, every house on a dead-end street. There were also the Lexus and the zippy single-engine airplane, a Cessna 400, which he’d never tried to fly. The couple traveled abroad constantly, and they planned to sponsor a home for 12 children at an orphanage in India. In India, Cotten remarked, the Canadian dollar went a long way.

Cotten rarely brought up his work, but details emerged. He was a founder and the CEO of Quadriga, Canada’s dominant Bitcoin exchange—something like TD Ameritrade for cryptocurrency. He ran the business from his MacBook Pro, which he always carried with him. Once he left it behind on the Gulliver, which caused a momentary hysteria as the yacht had already departed the dock. He had Crohn’s disease and seemed to subsist on hummus; when others drank beer, he produced bottles of hard cider. He loved to fly: planes, helicopters, drones. He seemed like the kind of guy who might retire early to an island somewhere.

OFFICE SPACE

Cotten returned for lessons the following summer, though not as often. He was busy. Then, in December, Robertson called Sunnybrook to explain that Gerry, while on their honeymoon in Jaipur, had died suddenly. She wanted to sell the Gulliver. When national news articles began to appear a month later, they emphasized another detail: Cotten was the only person with the passwords to the accounts holding Quadriga’s funds—cryptocurrency and cash—worth approximately a quarter billion U.S. dollars. Nobody knew how to find the money.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/grayscale-to-launch-diversified-crypto-fund-for-public-trading-in-apparent-1st-in-us,"American digital asset management fund Grayscale Investments is soon launching its diversified cryptocurrency investment product for public trading. Dubbed Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (DLC), the product includes five major cryptos including Bitcoin (ETH) and Ether (ETH), and will soon be available to trade on the over-the-counter (OTC) share trading marketplace OTCQX Best Market, the firm announced Nov. 22.

Launched in 2018, DLC is an open-ended fund that provides market cap-based exposure to the upper 70% of the digital currency asset class. It will now be publicly traded under the symbol GDLCF.

GDLCF is the fourth publicly-traded investment product launched by Grayscale

As previously announced, GDLCF will purportedly be the first publicly-quoted security based on a basket of digital currencies in the United States. As of Oct. 31, 2019, DLC included 80.6% of Bitcoin, 9.2% of Ether, 6.0% of XRP, 2.5% of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and 1.7% of Litecoin (LTC). The composition of DLC is evaluated on a quarterly basis and may also hold cash and assets arising as a result of a fork, airdrop, or similar event from time to time, Grayscale added.

GDLCF would be the fourth publicly-quoted investment product launched by Grayscale so far. The investment product follows the public trading launch of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (OTCQX: ETHE), and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (OTCQX: ETCG).

The launch follows FINRA approval and DTC eligibility acquisition

In order to publicly quote the shares of its diversified cryptocurrency fund on OTC markets, GDLCF had to receive approval from two different organizations.

First, the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) gave the product its stamp of approval in mid-October 2019.

Then, as Grayscale announced Nov. 22, its DLC product has received Depository Trust Company (DTC) eligibility, after which it can launch GDLCF for public trading. The firm has not yet announced the specific launch date.

DLC is not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to date, as Grayscale claims that the fund is “not subject to disclosure and certain other requirements mandated by U.S. securities laws.”

However, Grayscale has filed with the SEC to become the first crypto fund to report to the regulator. On Nov. 19, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust filed Form 10 to register its shares under the Exchange Act.

The firm recently recorded a new record in quarterly inflows as it reportedly registered more than $254 million in total investment into its products in Q3 2019. According to Grayscale, as much as 84% of investment came from institutional investors, dominated by hedge funds.",

If you are considering entering the crypto universe or if you’ve only recently made your first investment, you might still be exploring the benefits of bitcoin as opposed to your credit card, online bank account or digital wallet you are used to. In an abstract sense, cryptocurrencies represent financial evolution which manifests itself in unique and tangible ways compared to fiat money.

Fast and Easy Payments

If there’s one thing cryptocurrency deserves credit for, besides that it makes you a true owner of your money, it’s the ease it brings to electronic payments and transfers. Bitcoin has been around for over a decade now and it is not a tool only for the tech savvy anymore. A myriad of crypto platforms have made it simple to keep and send digital coins. It takes just a few steps to purchase your first cryptos and start spending.

All you need to have initially is a bitcoin wallet and plenty of free options are available. For beginners, a software wallet is probably the best choice and you can download and install a number of mobile applications or desktop programs. If you don’t plan to spend coins on a daily basis and in case you need a higher level of security for your crypto holdings, you’ll be better off with a hardware wallet – getting one is easy too.

With cryptocurrencies, sending money is quick, easy and inexpensive. You just need to have the recipient’s address, which you can either copy and paste in your wallet, making sure the first and the last few digits are the same, or obtain it through a simple QR scan as most wallet apps allow you to do so. After entering an amount, hitting the ‘Send’ button initiates an irreversible transaction; it’s a good idea to set up a spending PIN on your wallet as well.

Low Cost Transactions

Generally, crypto transactions are fast and cheap but the speed and the cost depend on various factors such as the number of transactions a network has to process at a given time and the fee you are willing to pay to the miners. Bear in mind that not all cryptocurrencies are made equal, so to speak. In the case with coins such as bitcoin cash (BCH), transfers are almost instant and often cost less than a penny. That’s regardless of the amount sent or distance covered. With crypto, payments, transactions, and international transfers are faster, easier and safer and you don’t have to worry about progressive fees or bank holidays.

People sending remittances home and companies working with remote contractors abroad often take advantage of that. Besides, bitcoin has another useful feature – you can always check if and when the money has arrived. You can do so with a block explorer. Small businesses should also appreciate the lack of chargebacks with crypto transactions, in contrast with traditional payment methods.

Profitable Saving, Accessible Credit

If you join the crypto space in search of a better store of value than what the fiat system offers for your money, it’s worth noting that by design cryptocurrencies don’t suffer from significant inflation. Digital assets based on the original principles of Bitcoin have a limited supply, setting them apart from fiat currencies, which can be constantly inflated when governments create more money through quantitative easing or by manipulating benchmark interest rates. Historically, long term investments in many major cryptos have appreciated.

Using peer-to-peer digital cash does not require involvement of third parties, which is another strong point. Everyone is free to transact directly with anybody else. But if you need specialized financial services, a thriving ecosystem growing around cryptocurrencies can provide you with such. Platforms like Cred, for instance, let you earn up to 10% interest on your BTC and BCH holdings, much more than any regular savings account these days, or get a sub-10% APR crypto-backed loan without the credit checks and hidden fees employed by banks and credit card companies.

In a tweet published on Nov. 22, Hoskinson urged the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin is more than speculation, putting the blame on the latest drop in price on news media “FUD” — or fear, uncertainty and doubt — and market manipulation.

A global movement

Because there’s more to Bitcoin than just price movements, he expects the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to see more gains in the future. He said:

“Bitcoin's price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that's going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future.”

Bitcoin’s recent price action

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin and altcoins have seen a notable price decrease yesterday. More precisely, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $7,000 before settling slightly higher.

Still, as Cointelegraph’s market analysis pointed out, Bitcoin dominance is up for the week at 69%, meaning that BTC has once again outperformed other cryptocurrencies during the despite its decline this week.

Shortly after the price drop, Bitcoin futures daily volumes on digital asset platform Bakkt have hit a new all-time high, showing an increased interest in capitalizing on the renewed volatility.

In October, Hoskinson also expressed the idea that if Bitcoin fails, the entire cryptocurrency industry could fail.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/grayscale-commences-diversified-large-cap-fund-trading/,"Grayscale Commences Diversified Large Cap Fund Trading

In February 2018, Grayscale Investments, the sponsor of the Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC) announced the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, an investment vehicle that captures a basket of the top digital assets within the cryptoconomy. A year later on November 22, the firm revealed the diversified crypto investment product is now available to the public as trading commences with publicly-quoted shares under the symbol: GDLCF.

Grayscale Reveals Diversified Crypto Investment Product Available for Public Trading

Last year, Grayscale Investments announced the launch of the diversified GDLCF and four single-asset cryptocurrency trusts for XRP, BCH, LTC, and ETH. Grayscale is well known for launching the first publicly traded BTC investment vehicle (OTC:GBTC) in the U.S. in 2013. Now according to a recent blog post, Grayscale says that GDLCF will be available to trade using over-the-counter (OTC) platform OTCQX Best Market. “GDLCF is the first publicly traded security in the U.S. deriving value from a diverse selection of digital currencies,” Grayscale said on Friday. This will give investors the ability to purchase and sell GDLCF using their investments accounts similarly to traditional unregistered securities. “You can soon gain exposure to a basket of large-cap digital currencies without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping digital currencies directly,” the firm stressed. Grayscale’s Director of Investments and Research, Matthew Beck, emphasized during the announcement that “digital assets represent a new and important alternative source of return for investors.”

“[Cryptocurrencies’] unique market opportunities, use cases, and risk exposures can also enhance diversification,” Beck further suggested. “A well-constructed, diversified investment product like Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund is an important tool for investors seeking to build more balanced portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns.”

Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund Receives FINRA Approval for Public Quotation

The GDLCF launch on OTCQX Best Market follows Grayscale registering GBTC using a Form 10 Registration Statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing would designate the GBTC trust as an SEC-approved reporting company and register its shares. If approved by the SEC, then Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust could be the first digital currency vehicle to be greenlighted by the SEC with a legal reporting status. The latest Grayscale blog post also noted that GDLCF received FINRA approval for public quotation alongside DTC eligibility. DTC issuance grants can take up to four weeks and it’s possible Grayscale’s GDLCF will be able to be deposited through DTC, the largest securities depository in the world.

Grayscale highlights that as of October 31, 2019, the components of the large-cap fund consist of a basket of 80.6% BTC, 9.2% ETH, 6% XRP, 2.5% BCH, and 1.7% LTC. “[GDLCF is an] open-ended fund that provides market-cap-weighted exposure to the upper 70% of the digital currency asset class,” Grayscale explains. The basket fund will be the company’s fourth publicly quoted investment product following GBTC, the Ethereum Trust (OTCQX: ETHE), and the Ethereum Classic Trust (OTCQX: ETCG). Investors will still have to wait for the public quotation approval for the Bitcoin Cash Investment Trust, Litecoin Investment Trust, and XRP Investment Trust. “A well constructed, diversified investment product like Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund is an important tool for investors seeking to build more balanced portfolios with higher risk-adjusted returns,” Grayscale’s Beck concluded on Friday.

Local media Sohu reported on the actions undertaken by Chinese authorities on Nov. 22. However, the date at which the event itself took place is unclear.

However, the news was published much later. She also claimed that the Beijing-based exchange in question is noteworthy:

“It’s a relatively known up-and-rising exchange.”

In a blog post published on Nov. 18, the exchange addressed user withdrawal issues. The firm also confirmed that Chinese authorities have halted operations:

“According to market sources, it is understood that BISS’ operations have been halted following an enquiry by China’s regulatory authorities around its services offered to users, which may not be aligned with capital controls regulations in China.”

Tezos (XTZ) seems to be immune to the recent crypto market slide, continuing its rally from the past weeks. XTZ was up to as high as $1.33, gaining momentum and potentially signaling a successful quarter.

XTZ Carries Warning for Pump Behavior

Tezos price moves have confused traders, as there is no significant underlying reason for the appreciation. The best explanation is hype based on the recent addition to Coinbase, making the asset more accessible.

#XTZ 4H and daily breaking consolidation. Picked up some this morning for a potential push. Bitcoin may try to ruin the party but for now the chart shows promise. pic.twitter.com/C0KfvzxAkh — NebraskanGooner📈 (@nebraskangooner) November 21, 2019

The XTZ price move follows bullish chart indicators, which help move a relatively small market. Tezos trading volume clocked around $113 million in 24 hours and is the second-biggest in the coin’s history. In the past month, XTZ moved up from stagnant positions around $0.76, once again attempting to move into a price of a few dollars.

Tezos Project Delay Led to Lower XTZ Price

One of the setbacks for XTZ was that it was a latecomer, with the main net launch during the bear market. This pushed down market prices, as XTZ struggled for listings, and the asset went through a new phase of price discovery. The preliminary token, only thinly traded, easily moved to $4-5, but the asset was not as lucky.

Now, Tezos seems to be catching up. The coin has a unique trading profile, as it trades on a handful of exchanges. Most of the volumes are concentrated on Binance, with Kraken and Coinbase also adding fuel. This would allow XTZ to rise based on a concerted pump activity on those markets.

XTZ price is also highly independent from the moves of Bitcoin (BTC), as 27% of volumes are directly against the US dollar, while 30% are against Tether (USDT). This allows the coin to behave counter to the markets, and discover unique sources of liquidity.

Whale activity also suggests that Binance may be the arena of new price moves for XTZ. Although, a potential dump following the pump is not out of question.

The other benefit is the strong Tezos community, which remains enthusiastic despite the bear market. The supporters of the network focus on its potential to carry smart contracts and security tokens, while some advice not to look too much into market prices.

Dear all #Tezos lovers. Please don't make noise, and enjoy your bags. #XTZ must not fall into FOMO Army and keeps going well, supporting technical development. It's not a goal of a simple trade, but a long term perspective. #Tezos is not marketing. Long live to #xtz — Jacques Marron⚡️ (@jacquesmarron) November 22, 2019

The recent revival of XTZ and the option for custodial wallets through Coinbase also attracted the attention of Amun, a creator of exchange-traded products based on crypto assets. Tezos is one of the nine coins selected by Amun, to create products for the European market.

Are crypto assets able to be diversified at all? These are the questions that many “Hodlers” have been asking. The slow bleed of Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies prices has been challenging investors and their holding powers. Despite BTC still able to maintain its 112% year-to-date gains so far — thanks to the massive bull run in the second quarter and the recent China-inspired rally — the recent price correction could pressure some of the latecomers. In this article, we will study some possible diversification options for crypto portfolios from a Hodler’s perspective — i.e., diversifying investment by allocating capital into various crypto assets using long-only strategies. We will also explore how altcoins and stablecoins could balance a portfolio.

Why diversify?

In the traditional world of finance, the performance of different assets could vary under different market conditions. For example, real estate investment trusts could outperform general equities in a turbulence market, and defensive stocks could disappoint investors when the appetite for risk is heightened. That’s when diversification comes in. The main purpose of exposure to different asset classes is to balance risk and return in a portfolio.

In the cryptocurrency space, diversification could also be one of the ways to manage risk exposure. However, some would argue that it is impossible to diversify a crypto portfolio due to the fact that major altcoins are highly correlated with Bitcoin. However, with a carefully selected basket of altcoins — in conjunction with stablecoins — investors could able to navigate the market more effectively with manageable risk.

Concentration vs. diversification

There has always been a debate about putting all your eggs in one basket. While in some cases concentrating on only one asset could maximize profitability, this also maximizes the risk exposure. On top of that, a heavy-concentration strategy gives investors no room for any errors in analysis, and it overexposes the investor to unnecessary risks.

However, over-diversification could also hurt investment returns. Some investors believe that the more assets they own, the better return they can have — and that’s not the right concept. It could increase investment cost, add unnecessary due-diligence efforts and lead to below-average risk-adjusted returns.

Market performance overview

Before getting into portfolio diversification, let’s have a quick recap on the performance of major cryptocurrencies. The figure below shows that OKB and BTC were among some of the YTD gainers, while XMR and XRP have been underperforming compared to their peers. Once again, this shows various crypto assets could perform very differently, highlighting the importance of balancing risk and return.

Asset allocation

A portfolio with a balanced selection of coins and tokens could help Hodlers balance risk and returns. Here are some sample portfolios using BTC alongside other leading altcoins as well as the Fundstrat Crypto 40 Index — a weighted index tracks the top 11 to 50 cryptocurrencies by market value and liquidity. The results could make Hodlers think again about putting all their eggs in one basket.

Many BTC-based portfolios have remained solidly in the green, due in part to Bitcoin holding on to its 112% gain so far this year. As shown above, however, the portfolio containing only BTC and Ether (ETH) has been underperformed compared to portfolios that have both BTC and exposure to mid-cap altcoins. To see this, compare the 50/50 portfolio (with a yearly gain of 67%) to the one consisting of Bitcoin and the top-40 index (gaining 77% on the year).

Meanwhile, the hedging nature of stablecoins like Tether (USDT) has been reflected in the sample portfolio based on BTC and the index with a hedge (76%). In this diversification example, the exposure to altcoins is reduced, the BTC holdings are slightly increased and USDT was added. Still, the gain of this portfolio was very close to the one without USDT. In general, a portfolio that includes stablecoins can reduce the risk ratio more than one that is unhedged, but as the examples above show, it is still possible to achieve similar results.

Stablecoins are especially important in portfolios that include highly volatile coins and tokens, as can be seen in the example of the hedged basket. The group comprises XLM and OKB, which have plummeted over 46% and surged over 290% respectively. Still, this combination was able to achieve almost 80% YTD gains, and the USDT holdings were part of the reason behind that performance. In contrast, the mixture of BTC and certain altcoins without a stablecoin in the basket could underperform the other sample portfolios provided.

Advanced setup

Additionally, experienced traders and Hodlers are able to fine-tune their portfolios by adding derivatives on top of a long-only portfolio. For example, if a Hodler is being short-term bullish on an individual coin, he can increase his leverage on that specific coin by adding futures or perpetual swap positions on top of the holdings. Structured products can also be used as a hedge in a downturning market.

Crypto asset diversification has been one of the most debated topics in the industry. Some would argue that a 100% Bitcoin allocation setup could probably still able to generate a decent return this year. However, a BTC-only portfolio will never able to capture the distinctive opportunities in the altcoin world, which could potentially generate higher returns — and, of course, putting all your eggs in one basket comes with higher risk. A carefully designed portfolio with balanced asset allocation could maximize the risk-adjusted return. As the year-end approaches, investors and Hodlers can review their risk profiles and adjust their strategies for next year.

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://dailywealth.com/articles/get-in-before-the-crypto-industry-goes-mainstream-in-2020/,"Editor's note: The Weekend Edition is adapted from the daily Stansberry Digest. This week, Crypto Capital analyst Fred Marion shares three reasons why cryptos could go from the fringes of society into the mainstream in 2020. Steve is cautious when it comes to cryptos, but he's always looking for moneymaking opportunities to share with DailyWealth readers. So if you're interested in crypto investing, you must read this essay...

The first time I bought bitcoin, it took a week...

I spent two days setting up the necessary software on my computer. Then, after filling out all the required forms, I had to take the printouts to a nearby drugstore. At the store, I called a number in California from a red, ancient-looking MoneyGram phone.

The woman on the other end read me a code over the crackly line. I took that code to the cash register, along with my paperwork and cash... Finally, a few anxiety-filled days later, the money transfer cleared my bank and a tiny bit of bitcoin showed up in my crypto wallet.

Looking back, I wish I bought more... Bitcoin is up roughly 32 times since my first purchase.

Meanwhile, since that day in 2013, the crypto landscape has transformed dramatically...

Now, you can buy bitcoin in about five minutes with resources like Square's Cash App and Coinbase's debit card purchases. You don't even need to leave your own home.

And of course, the crypto industry has evolved to include many more options... Bitcoin is one of more than 6,000 cryptos you can actively buy and sell with the right tools today.

Also, ""blockchain developer"" is one of the fastest-growing job categories on the planet...

In February, a report from job-search website Hired showed that demand for software engineers with blockchain-development skills grew by more than 500% over the past year. And as the website noted in its report, this demand isn't going to disappear anytime soon...

There was an explosion of demand in the past 12 months for developers with blockchain skills and we expect demand to continue growing as businesses begin implementing its countless use cases, from digital identity and smart contracts to workforce management and distributed data storage.

But even though we've seen such incredible growth in the crypto space over the past several years, we've only laid the groundwork for what's to come. And as I'll explain today, 2020 could make the past decade of blockchain development look like child's play...

""Can you buy anything with it?""

That's one of the first questions most people ask me about bitcoin. I point to a few websites that accept it – like Overstock.com, for example – but that doesn't impress anyone.

Even though it's easier than ever to trade cryptos, they still haven't gone mainstream. I'm sure a lot of DailyWealth readers have heard of bitcoin... But how many of you actually own any?

That could soon change in a big way...

You see, in the first half of next year, Bakkt – a digital-assets startup that's backed by Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange – plans to test a bitcoin merchant network. Coffee giant Starbucks (SBUX) will be its first launch partner.

In other words, if everything plays out as expected, many folks in the U.S. should be able to walk into the nearest Starbucks just months from now and buy an espresso with bitcoin.

While we don't know all the details yet, we know around 75 million customers visit Starbucks each month. Exposing so many folks to bitcoin as a payment option would be the biggest public relations boon in crypto's history. It could change perceptions of bitcoin overnight.

The act of training Starbucks' more than 180,000 U.S. employees on processing bitcoin transactions is big in and of itself. I look at it like a mandatory bitcoin education program... one that will generate countless coffee-shop conversations.

I expect bitcoin payments to become popular at Starbucks, especially among millennials...

Millennials are digital natives, after all – a generation that came of age with the Internet. They trust bits and bytes in a way that older generations struggle to comprehend.

Consider this... According to a survey published earlier this year by investment platform eToro, 43% of millennial online traders trust cryptocurrency exchanges more than they do the U.S. stock market.

Based on an online survey conducted this spring, meanwhile, Americans ages 18 to 34 are four times more likely to own bitcoin than those ages 45 to 64, and 10 times more likely than folks 65 and older. Younger folks view money through a different lens...

For them, it's not something you entrust to the government. It's something you entrust to the inalienable laws of mathematics and computer code. And nearly 30% of them would rather hold bitcoin than bonds or stocks.

Some millennials trust bitcoin so much more than the U.S. dollar that they've given the dollar a nickname... ""boomer bucks."" The idea of carrying around cash is just quaint to many millennials.

But in 2020, we could see something bigger than Starbucks' entrance into the crypto world...

As I explained in the November 15 DailyWealth, social media giant Facebook (FB) officially unveiled its own crypto – called ""libra"" – earlier this year. It's not a bitcoin clone...

Instead, Facebook and its roughly 20 partners in the so-called Libra Association seek to create a form of money with a stable value – what's known in the crypto industry as a ""stablecoin.""

Today, most stablecoins are pegged to national currencies...

For example, crypto token Tether – which trades in the crypto universe under the symbol ""USDT"" – launched in 2014 with the goal of maintaining a 1-to-1 ratio with the U.S. dollar. That means 1 USDT should always be worth $1. To maintain that peg, Tether Limited – the token's creator – aims to back every USDT it issues with a fiat dollar in a bank account.

That's where libra will be different... Rather than being backed by the U.S. dollar alone, libra will be backed by several countries' currencies, as well as sovereign bonds.

Since its launch in 2014, Tether has grown into a behemoth. Its trading volumes often exceed even bitcoin's. Some $20 billion of Tether change hands every day, much of it moving capital between China – with its strict capital controls – and the rest of the world.

While I was attending Vegas Blockchain Week last month, libra came up in conversation...

A prominent entrepreneur in the space described libra as ""crypto's punching bag.""

It's the first high-profile project to take the full brunt of the U.S. government's anger over the birth of cryptocurrencies. Essentially – and I'm paraphrasing here – the entrepreneur said this about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the U.S. government...

He didn't just poke the bear. He stripped off all his clothes, slathered honey all over his body, climbed into the cave, and grabbed the bear's newborn cubs.

From almost the moment libra was announced, you got the sense that regulators and lawmakers smelled blood...

First, they called David Marcus, Facebook's crypto chief, before U.S. congressional committees. They wanted the company's commitment that it wouldn't release libra before new regulations were put in place.

""I committed to waiting for us to have all the appropriate regulatory approvals and have addressed all concerns before moving forward,"" Marcus responded.

That wasn't good enough... So government officials summoned Zuckerberg to Capitol Hill for six hours of excruciating hearings.

This wasn't testimony so much as verbal abuse. And it sets a dangerous precedent... the idea that entrepreneurs must go to Washington and beg for permission to innovate.

There's a reason why Washington is nervous, though...

Facebook's user base is staggering. Between the company's four products – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger – it has 2.8 billion monthly users worldwide.

To put that in perspective, only around 356 million people – everyone living in the U.S. and a handful of other territories and countries, including Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Ecuador, and Zimbabwe – use the U.S. dollar as at least one of their official currencies.

If libra launches next year, it could become one of the world's largest currencies overnight.

And even if it doesn't happen in 2020, I believe libra will launch at some point.

Despite the regulatory outcry – and the departure of some of the Libra Association's high-profile partners, including financial-services companies Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), and PayPal (PYPL) – the opportunity is too big for it not to happen... even if it takes until 2021.

And another wild card could make an even bigger impact than libra in 2020...

I'm talking about the world's most populated country – China.

You see, while Facebook's potential entrance into the crypto industry continues to meet opposition both here in the U.S. and abroad, China is taking things into its own hands...

In a speech in late October, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country intends to ""take the leading position in the emerging field of blockchain."" And he noted that the country will increase investments to make it happen. Bitcoin prices rocketed 40% higher on the news.

But Xi wasn't endorsing bitcoin so much as setting the table for the release of China's own digital currency. And it could be coming sooner rather than later...

The Chinese government has been working on a digital currency since 2014. And it's ""almost ready,"" a senior official at the country's central bank said in August.

China is playing 3D chess while the rest of the world is playing checkers...

""They already have all the systems and the network ready,"" Jack Lee, managing partner of HCM Capital, told financial news network CNBC earlier this month. ""I think you will see it very soon, in the next maybe two to three months.""

Today, the dollar reigns supreme as the global reserve currency. It's an exorbitant privilege for the U.S... one that has allowed us to run massive trade deficits for decades with few to no repercussions. But if the Chinese yuan is suddenly cheaper, faster, and easier to use thanks to nearly instantaneous settlements, nothing will stop the world from switching.

Old habits die hard... But they die quickly if it means more money in people's pockets.

Facebook's libra and China's looming digital currency both share a major problem, though...

As far as we know, they'll both be backed by the same fiat currencies we use today. That means they will also ultimately inherit the biggest problem with fiat money... inflation.

Meanwhile, bitcoin was designed to be the hardest form of money in history...

Eventually, the world will have 21 million bitcoin... and no more. That's the way bitcoin's founder – an individual (or group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto – programmed the network when bitcoin was first released in 2009. There will never be a 21,000,001st bitcoin.

It's such a finitely scarce asset that it's hard to even conceptualize what it means...

If everyone in the world got an equal number of bitcoin, we would each have less than 0.003 bitcoin (about $22 worth at today's prices). If we only gave out bitcoin to millionaires, the 14 million of them in the world today would each get roughly 1.5 bitcoin (about $11,000 worth).

That radical scarcity is one of the reasons many people refer to bitcoin as ""digital gold."" It's a place for investors to store their wealth where it can't be watered down by bureaucrats.

So what does all this mean?

In 2020, we'll finally see people spending bitcoin to buy coffee. And we'll see corporations and governments embracing cryptos – from Facebook's libra to China's digital currency.

Bitcoin will finally go from the fringes of society into the mainstream.

In June, a survey from Statista showed just how far we have to go... The market-research firm polled roughly 1,000 people in each participating country to find out how global consumers think. The following chart shows respondents' familiarity with cryptocurrencies...

As you can see, Turkey leads the way with about one in five of the poll participants from the country saying they own crypto. The depreciation of the country's fiat currency – the lira – has resulted in the rising popularity of cryptocurrencies over the past several years.

But here in the U.S., only 5% of the Statista survey's respondents – all Internet users between ages 18 and 64 – said they have owned cryptocurrencies. That's a lot of potential market share before you even leave our country.

Bitcoin's market cap remains small... It's still only about $150 billion today. Many U.S.-listed stocks are bigger than that.

And bitcoin's supply is limited... We'll never have more than 21 million, as we said. So if a lot of people from just one country start pouring money into the space, its price could rocket higher.

In fact, it could go much higher than almost anyone can imagine today...

Though it likely won't be a straight move up, bitcoin is becoming more accepted every day.

You no longer need to spend a week jumping through hoops – installing hard-to-understand software, talking to someone on a beat-up phone while standing in the corner of a drugstore, and then waiting impatiently for days – just to buy a small number of bitcoin.

We're seeing it with Starbucks... We're seeing it with libra... And we're seeing it with China.

My colleague and Crypto Capital editor Eric Wade believes bitcoin will soar to $1 million in our lifetimes. That's more than 13,000% higher than today's price (about $7,500).

While I'm excited about bitcoin's prospects, it isn't the biggest opportunity in the crypto space right now...

Earlier this week, Dr. Ron Paul – the 12-term U.S. congressman and three-time presidential candidate – joined Eric for a special crypto-focused event.

They gave attendees a behind-the-scenes look at what's happening in the crypto space right now. And more important, Eric revealed all the details about the ""next bitcoin""...

This tiny crypto currently trades for less than one penny. Yet Eric believes it will ultimately change the way you – and millions of Americans – do business in dozens of different ways.

It could be even bigger than buying bitcoin for $0.05 back in 2010... If you invest just $100 in this crypto at today's prices, you'll be up more than $500,000 if it climbs to $50.

If you missed the event, that's OK. The good news is, it's not too late to get all the details...

You see, for the next few days, we're offering a free replay of the event. We want to make sure as many folks as possible have the opportunity to hear from Eric and Dr. Paul. Watch the replay right here.

Good investing,

Fred Marion

Editor's note: During this week's event, Eric shared all the details about an incredible buying opportunity in the crypto space. He said it's like ""going back in time and buying bitcoin for a nickel back in 2010."" Eric believes this crypto will be on the tips of everyone's tongues in 2020... yet it trades for less than a penny today. Get all the details right here.",

Compiled by cryptocurrency exchange Binance on Nov. 22, a survey asked 76 institutional investors who used its platform about their trading habits.

Exchange storage “most popular choice”

The survey was part of Binance’s Institutional Market Insights research, which is now in its second edition.

Among the most surprising results was that 92% of participants chose to keep their crypto — Bitcoin (BTC), stablecoins and others — with trusted third parties, and not under their own control.

The figure dwarfs much safer alternatives such as hardware wallets and other cold wallets.

“Exchanges remain as the most popular choice for cryptoasset storage amongst our institutional and VIP clients at 92.1%,” Binance summarized. Researchers added:

“When moving to self-storage, cold wallets are the second most favored choice, given their improved safety and control. Third-party custody services were the least popular option at 2.6%.”

The 76 investors cannot be said to have significant exposure in terms of capital — over 50% had total crypto holdings of under 10 units of a coin. 10 BTC currently equals around $72,000.

Demands to take back control of crypto

As Cointelegraph reported, investors face significantly increased risk of loss and theft of coins if they remain in wallets to which they do not control the private keys.

Exchanges, including Binance, continue to see hacks this year, while regulatory scrutiny can also see funds locked up without notice until an account owner provides personal identity data.

Efforts to make investors aware of the need to control their money are mounting. On Jan. 3, the second annual Proof of Keys event will challenge all Bitcoin holders to remove their funds from third-party wallets.

The hefty movement was detected by Twitter-based transaction monitor @whale_alert this afternoon. Bitcoin’s miners included it in block #605230.

According to Blockchain.com’s Bitcoin explorer, the fee paid was just 0.00004551 BTC ($0.32). This is incredibly low, especially when compared to large movements previously detected.

It’s even more impressive when you consider that whoever sent the Bitcoin had no need to request permission from any bank, financial regulator, or world government to send hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital cash.

Unlike the traditional banking system, Bitcoin users are afforded the freedom to choose their own transaction fees.

Transactions with higher fees attached are generally processed quicker than those with smaller ones.

In July, one Bitcoin whale moved $450 million multiple times, paying roughly $400 in fees for each transaction.

As well, Hard Fork reported that another big player had shifted $1 billion worth of Bitcoin in September. They paid $700 in fees to the network.

Have the whales figured out they’ve been overpaying?",2019-11-24 00:00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/after-blockstacks-regulated-offering-where-now-for-us-token-sales/,"After Blockstack’s Regulated Offering, Where Now For US Token Sales?

When Blockstack announced the first Reg A+ token sale, many believed it would open the floodgates for a spate of similar offerings. Reg A+ has long been the Holy Grail of token offerings in the U.S., with a host of companies pursuing the only SEC exemption that allows the inclusion of unaccredited investors. Despite Blockstack winning significant praise and plaudits for securing the exemption where so many had failed, and despite the hope that others would follow where Blockstack has led, the predicted stampede of new Reg A+ offerings has simply failed to materialize.

The Blockstack Problem

Just two months after the completion of a $23M Reg A+ offering, Blockstack investors are feeling the pinch from owning a token which is now trading at 50% of its public sale price. As The Block’s Larry Cermack opined, anyone who has witnessed the tribulations of Blockstack will have serious pause for thought before pursuing their own regulated security offering.

It’s worth considering that a contributing factor as to why Blockstack succeeded in securing its Reg A+ exemption is because it threw serious amounts of money at the problem: a cool $3.5 million dollars to be exact. After all the time, effort and capital expended on what looks like a rapidly diminishing prospect, it’s little wonder that Reg A+ has begun to look less appealing.

Charting Another Path

Although Reg A+ has been the headline-grabbing STO funding mechanism, there are other, less sexy paths to winning an SEC exemption. A number of companies have taken the Reg D route to securing their token sale, and while this method excludes non-accredited investors from participating, it is also less onerous both in terms of expenditure and compliance. Perhaps the best comparison of Reg D versus Reg A+ is Startengine, the crowdfunding site that successfully won approval for a Reg D offering in 2017, just three months after filing. Following its success in securing a Reg D exemption, Startengine filed to conduct a Reg A+ offering which has yet to win approval despite being lodged with the SEC in November 2018.

Reg A+ and Reg D are not the only paths available to U.S. firms, however, if they are willing to look a little further afield for their investors. Preflogic, which is supported by Prime Trust, is currently pursuing a Reg S ‘safe harbor’ exemption that will allow investors outside of the U.S. to invest in its Software-as-a-Service platform. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Preflogic project is that the finished service is designed to open asset inventories to underserved SMEs and individuals.

Its founder Todd Wier told news.Bitcoin.com: “The current regulatory landscape serves the U.S. well and is the primary reason the U.S. markets are so highly respected: checks, balances and regulatory oversight with an emphasis on corporate transparency. The downside is that it’s dated and needs to be upgraded technologically to serve world market demand.” Wier sees onerous compliance costs as a primary reason why many aspiring token projects have been dissuaded from pursuing a Reg A+ offering. He remains optimistic, however, that these costs may be reduced in future, saying:

From a regulatory standpoint, the possibility exists for the market to evolve such that SEC oversight is focused more on inspection and regulation of the token/system/smart contracts employed by the issuer, rather than the player.

A Challenging Market

In terms of the ease with which ordinary investors can participate, the American market remains one of the toughest nuts to crack. Even Blockstack, whose Reg A+ exemption seemed set to precipitate a new era of inclusive token offerings, has struggled to sustain a successful token price post-raise. For those seeking to raise funds in the STO market, Reg D or Reg S seems the more sensible path. Alternatively, they could play it safe and avoid the U.S. market altogether.

You are here because you’ve opened your eyes to a new type of society; one powered by a decentralised economy and full of shimmering new possibilities.”

This is not the calling card for a new religion. This is what new Monolith customers are met with when opening up the box for the first time. Narrative is a central part of cryptocurrency, whether people like it or not. While there are other cryptocurrency-funded debit cards like those from Wirex and Revolut, Monolith has taken narrative and made it central to its branding.

When I fished the Monolith crypto debit card out of my letterbox in South Berlin one morning, I was no longer an ordinary man. I became a man on a mission. A mission to live on crypto in Germany’s capital city.

Although the wall separating East from West in Berlin may have come down 30 years ago, I would take a virtual sledgehammer to financial divisions within this city of sin and ambition. For 7 days, I became a one-man disruption machine.

Out of this world

After opening up the sleek black package, a smaller box slides out. It depicts a post-apocalyptic landscape, somewhere halfway between the Earth and the other side of the Oort cloud. It’s equal parts Planet of the Apes and Interstellar.

From the matte black of the outer-space background, the card glows green like an alien lifeform. The unboxing may expose customers of a weaker disposition to lethal levels of nerdiness. The dramatic branding and transformative message is labored, but it doesn’t make me like it any less.

The app setup is quick and relatively painless. Loading screens are punctuated with painfully sappy messages about “kitties clogging the network,” but thankfully I am not met with much waiting time. The total time to set up the wallet was around 10 minutes, several of which were taken up as the wallet is “deployed.”

The sci-fi branding is consistent throughout Monolith. It’s the gamification of finance — you’re not just buying a pint with crypto, you’re also a space invader and Neil Armstrong all at the same time.

The whole user experience is geared toward convincing you that you are on a journey. They even use it to disguise when you need to cough up the cash for fees. Since the Ethereum network has branded these charges as ""gas,"" the Monolith card has a ""gas tank"" that you need to top up in order to pay for your transactions.

Berlin: A cardholder’s nemesis

If I truly had to live for a week with this card — from the moment I ordered it to the moment my money ran out — I would have died. I’d have starved to death in the time it takes for the card to arrive. “10 business days” is a sweet nothing that Monolith whispers into the consumer’s ear. Morning, noon and night I checked my postbox for that card like a forlorn child in small-town America looking for his ticket to the big city. But when it did arrive, boy did I forget about the life-threatening hunger.

I checked my account balance. The figures shimmered back at me from the slick mobile application. “Spend it all in the pub. All of it,” a voice whispered in my brain. It appealed to my deepest primal urge as a British man.

My liver whimpered in anticipation. I could bathe in Rioja like the Elizabeth Bathory of the crypto world. I put the thought to the back of my mind. Monolith had placed its faith in me to eke out a livable existence powered by the Ethereum blockchain. I would not let the technology down.

Withdrawing money from an ATM

Germans love cash. Newcomers to Berlin are usually astounded that you can rarely pay for anything with credit or debit cards. In any restaurant or bar, it is only a matter of time before you hear a disillusioned tourist loudly wail, “What do you mean you don’t take card?” Visitors will soon find themselves pounding the streets in search of somewhere to withdraw some cash.

Luckily, Berlin is well served by a number of banks and card machine providers. It’s said in life that there are two unavoidable things: death and taxes. But that quick-witted soul has clearly never been to Germany.

Any visitor to the city will know there is a third constant with exorbitant cost: ATM fees. In the United Kingdom, you can pop to a cash point and idly withdraw a 5 pound note, free of charge. In Berlin, you can routinely expect to pay between 4 euros and 7.5 euros for every withdrawal.

And that’s before your local bank charges you for using its card abroad. For this reason, Berliners visit cash machines as rarely as possible — and when they do, they take out enough to last them weeks at a time.

Not all cash machines are made equal in Berlin. But, having been stung by a 6 euro charge when in desperate need of a kebab one time too many, I’ve learned there are ways to avoid having your credit card savaged with each all-important withdrawal.

Sparkasse, a semi-state-owned bank, does not charge fees for withdrawing cash. It is high time for the creaking titans of state finance to meet a new financial force. I thrust the Monolith card into the glowing ATM slot. The machine swallows up the alien technology. At this stage, crypto has infiltrated the mainstream financial network. I am inside.

The Monolith card is a crypto-Agent Smith, hell-bent on transforming the financial matrix from the inside out. The process is as smooth as a silken slide. The machine whirrs and clanks as it gives up guardianship of the euro notes. I check my balance in the app. No charges. It was as easy as that.

Paying for food

Even for the most hardened crypto enthusiasts, hunched over a screen, pale from months of furious hodling, hunger comes at least once a day. Bearing my luminous green Monolith card, I venture out onto the mean streets of Berlin to sate my growling stomach. Of all the things people like to buy with money, food is almost universally acknowledged as the most important. But Berlin’s cash culture also spits on card users. It is almost impossible to find a decent bar or restaurant that will accept card payments. I try several places that have people with beards typing on laptops outside them. I witness a sprawling morass of avocado, but no one willing to take a card payment. Tired of staggering from one artisan cafe to the next, I turn a corner and see the golden arches of McDonald’s glimmer through the November gloom.

Has anyone eaten in a McDonald’s in the last 10 years? I don’t think they have. Certainly, no one has done it without a head injury or imminent threat of violence. I was about to buck that trend. It starts badly. I can’t remember the German word for chips. I just say potato and mime lacerating it into small strips.

Monolith’s contactless chip fails, as it is worryingly prone to do. The woman behind the counter looks at me the way a naive child would look at a wounded puppy. She gives me a sad, pitying smile and asks me to pop the card in, if I can remember the pin. She gently coaxes me through the rest of the process.

Monolith might have stumbled at the first hurdle, but when it comes to the crunch, it did not let me down. It was a seamless, instant transaction. In only a matter of seconds, I am the proud owner of a succulent McDonald’s meal. I look down at the tray full of salty, disgusting food. All mine. I eat it all, knowing that I am doing this for the purpose of meaningful journalism.

In paying for this food, surrounded by builders and railway workers in uniforms, many of whom have clearly not washed their hands, I am furthering the adoption of cryptocurrency. I am a one-man force of fintech power; the titans of finance quiver before me. I think about Jamie Dimon as I force down mouthful after mouthful of horrible chips. I’d show him.

Monolith’s card service bursts with ambition, but Berlin’s cash culture means the ATM should be the first point of call for hungry hodlers.

Paying for transport

From the labyrinthine tunnels of London’s underground to Moscow’s palatial metro system, capital cities of the world are shifting to contactless payments. Despite having great public transport, Berlin is trailing behind the rest of Europe (surprise).

After a weekend of traveling on public transport in London, my bank account looks like a squirrel after an unfortunate encounter with a 10-ton truck. Fortunately for many of Berlin’s employees, companies here often provide year-long public transport tickets. But for those that don’t, the office beckons, and it's down to you to foot the bill. With that, Monolith’s crypto card just found its next use case.

It is painfully early in the morning. I stand on the platform of Hermanstrasse station in South Berlin, channeling my inner office worker. If ever there should be a time for the card to fail me, I pray for it to be now. But the Monolith card steadfastly refuses to buckle under pressure.

I can both link the card to the city’s BVG travel app to buy a variety of tickets on the move and use the machine at the station. The show must go on. And I must get on that train. It was not long ago that I forced myself from the comfort of my bed, and, what seems only seconds later, I am pressed into the sweaty embrace of a full commuter train.

Nose to armpit contact before 9 a.m., facilitated by crypto. Like lambs to the slaughter, we make our way into the center of Berlin, backs bent before the cracking whip of the corporate world. The smell persists, but our journey continues unimpeded. Nonetheless, my breakfast is in serious danger of making a reappearance. Cautious consumers can take comfort in the knowledge that, out of the many factors that could make you late for work, paying with the Monolith card will sadly not be one of them.

As you might imagine in a city like Berlin, people who live here are often conscious of the environment. So, if using gas-guzzling public transport turns your stomach, plait your hair into pigtails, do your best Greta Thunberg impression and hop on one of the city’s myriad bike-sharing services. These are all done on mobile-based applications, and after linking the card up, you’re good to go.

I wondered if Monolith’s card would help me answer the oldest question in crypto. A question that hovers on the tongue of any investor worth their salt: When Lambo?

I looked into it. Rental prices in Berlin start from $850 per day. The answer to that timeless question? Not today.

Ordering online

For many dedicated crypto customers, time is money. Glued to charts, stacking sats and checking stats, cryptocurrency can be a lonely road. For when you can’t leave the computer, or the luxurious charm of your apartment proves all too alluring on a cold winter’s night, ordering online is never far from your mind.

Lieferando, Germany’s largest delivery service, accepts Bitcoin. Unfortunately, ETH is not yet an option. Nonetheless, Monolith’s crypto card will not stand in the way of an empty stomach and a generous helping of pizza. My mind scarred by the frightening proliferation of currywurst in this peculiar country, I navigate the site, content only with the best.

I choose Nini e Pettirosso, purveyors of apparently the best pizza in Berlin. Only a short while later, my spent crypto manifested itself to me in the form of a delicious mound of mozzarella, salami and garlic.

The card worked seamlessly for other online payments. I bought tickets to a show in Berlin’s iconic Comedy Club, nestled away on one of Neukolln’s backstreets. The payment was as efficient as any using a fiat-backed card.

But it was crypto that had bought me entrance to a bar with some top-drawer comedy. To my enormous surprise, the comedy club bar accepted card payments. From then on, the only thing that the Monolith card would further contribute to decentralizing that night would be my balance.

5/5

My seven days in the skin of an invincible crypto cyberpunk left me feeling empowered and mysterious. I have cultivated the air of a ‘60s Bond villain, short of a volcano lair. The Monolith card allowed me to skip around the city like a kid in a candy shop. If anything, I am saddened that my personal rampage has come to a close. The card holds up pretty well.

For a company that flirts with the notion of alien contact in its branding, it might want to sort out the contactless issues. Nonetheless, charges are mostly nonexistent, and when they do surface, they are low. For now, the Monolith service is not tied to an actual bank account, which means wire transfers are currently out of the question. For those looking for an all-in-one account, this might be a dealbreaker.

There are other card providers out there that do this. Wirex and Revolut both offer a seriously competitive service that both come with British pound or euro accounts for a seamless banking experience. For hardened crypto users, or people based in Europe that want an instant and reliable way to spend their crypto, this could be exactly what you need.

I’ll probably still use the card. I have had a taste of the cypherpunk philosophy, and one hit is not enough. The card might not replace the others in my wallet, but it will lie dormant, ready for the next time I feel Big Banking gets too big for its boots. One day soon, the banks will once again quiver before my wrath. The Monolith card might not turn water into wine, but it does turn ETH into Pinot Noir. That’s good enough for me.

BitRiver, the newly launched mining farm in Siberia, is now Russia’s largest bitcoin (BTC) mining facility. Mining billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s venture is already attracting large-scale clients, reports Bloomberg.

Bitcoin Mining Farm Churns out BTC with Hydroelectric Power

Deripaska has combined BTC mining and a data center with one of the largest Soviet-era aluminum plants. The power-hungry business of running a data center transformed the former industrial city of Bratsk into one of the largest post-Soviet data centers.

Russia is a hotspot of crypto activity, supplying both developers and amateur miners. But bitcoin mining on an industrial scale has lagged behind China, where some of the world’s most active farms are located.

The mining farm is built in partnership with local energy company En+ and uses local sources of hydroelectric power. Mining BTC is potentially one of the best uses for excess hydroelectric power, ensuring the producer will be able to sell all of its production, with no night-time drops in demand.

BitRiver itself is not a dedicated miner or a bitcoin mining pool. Instead, the company just hires out support services, as well as providing reliable access to cheap electricity. En+ supplies up to 100 megawatts per year to the Bratsk aluminum plant, allowing for BTC mining to happen on an industrial scale.

BTC Mining Close to Peak Levels

The entire bitcoin network consumes more than 73 terawatts per year, making BitRiver still a relatively small mining farm. The Bratsk hydroelectric plant produces a total of above 22.5 TW/h electricity per year, used for other industrial purposes, but could, in theory, supply a much larger bitcoin mining facility.

The exact hash rate of the farm is unknown, but reports have shown BitRiver is used by clients from the US, Japan, and China.

The Bitcoin network hash rate has shot up to above 106 quintillion hashes per second, very close to previously clocked peak levels. Mining has seen slow days, but ahead of the halving, most large pools attempt to maximize their rewards.

Even at prices around $7,200, BTC rewards remain attractive, and miners also have the possibility to hedge their risk on the bitcoin futures market, as well as the upcoming options market.

The Russian Federation hosts 243 BTC nodes and is among the top 10 countries with most bitcoin mining nodes in the world. This level of adoption also points to local demand for digital assets. The Russian government has spoken warnings against mining, especially using residential electricity grids. But Deripaska has managed to start a new business on a global scale, despite waiting for US sanctions to lift.

Image via Shutterstock",2019-11-24 16:21:52+00:00,https://decrypt.co/11786/how-crypto-activism-is-trying-to-change-the-world,"In the ashes of the Financial Crisis of 2008, bitcoin quietly emerged, kickstarting an ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and decentralized financial networks that don’t rely on central banks. Bitcoin became a statement against the status quo; a new form of activism.

For Micah White, the co-founder of Occupy Wall Street, the future of activism is in crypto. Even though his own street protest went viral in 2011, after thousands of protestors pitched tents near Wall Street to challenge wealth inequality, White considers street protest “a dying form of activism.” He says that “social media driven activism”, or “clicktivism,” isn’t particularly effective, either. But blockchain offers an effective alternative, says White. So much so, he took to the DEVCON stage in October 2019 to explain his vision for blockchain-backed activism.

First, White explained that blockchain sprouts new kinds of economic logic, which, if used, could derail traditional financial instruments. White points to the deflationary token, Bomb, which claims to be the world’s ""first self-destructing currency."" Each time a Bomb is transferred, one percent of the transaction is destroyed, meaning that its value deflates over time. Shuffle Monster meanwhile, takes a two percent transaction fee from every trade, half of which is burned, and the rest redistributed to one of the 512 top token holders. White’s own project, Sparkle, ventures even further, distributing two percent to everyone else in the economy.

White also said crypto is changing how groups fundraise. Whether pro-democracy movements like the Hong Kong protests, or ISIS, political groups have looked to crypto as a way of fund-raising away from institutions looking to stop them. For the Hong Kong Free Press, it raised funds in bitcoin to help provide impartial coverage of the Hong Kong protests. For ISIS, it used cryptocurrencies to help buy weapons.

“You can't create new forms of protests that are going to inherently not allow people that you disagree with to use it,” White tells Decrypt. “All we can hope for is that we make it easier and better for good people to use.”

White’s major play is “adversarial smart contracts,” smart contracts explicitly designed to be weaponized against some status quo.

He tells Decrypt it’s his mission to create the first smart contract that’s banned for political reasons. “If we can turn the smart contract itself into a form of protest, then we'll be opening up a whole new terrain of battle.”

White’s recently launched a smart contract that does just that: dETH, a coin that destroys ETH from the Ethereum economy. “ETH sent to this smart contract is irrevocably killed and removed from the economy. It is not just burned, it is dead,” White wrote in a blog post.

Whereas burning a hundred-dollar paper bill leaves you, well, $100 poorer, destroying ETH creates value, through dETH, says White. The price of dETH increases by 0.1 percent with every purchase—and the way to purchase dETH directly, of course, is by destroying ETH.

Those destroying more than 3 ETH will receive a 30 percent bonus in the amount of dETH they receive. 3 ETH is the block reward for creating ETH, so destroying 3 more than ETH at a time thus means that more ETH is being destroyed than is created through block rewards.

Few—apart from perhaps White—have actually used dETH. But, since it’s just a piece of software, White said that dETH could be used by future activists, as and when necessary. “dETH will just exist on the blockchain until people take it seriously,” says White. If they do, “it'll take off”.

Another adversarial smart contract, Reigningemperor.com, runs on White’s Sparkle and is hosted on the peer-to-peer file storage system, IPFS. It spreads the message “Reigning Emperor,” a phrase the website claims is banned by the Chinese government. Any appearances of the phrase online are banned by an algorithm. Posting the phrase online lowers the social credit scores of Chinese citizens—the controversial social program whereby a low credit score, attained through misbehavior, could lead to denials of airplane tickets or apartment rentals. Posting the phrase “Reigning Emperor” online has reportedly led to arrests.

Activists wanting to spread the message can send ETH to this smart contract to receive the Reigning Emperor token, which they can then transfer to as many wallets as possible. Because the blockchain is anonymous, authorities can’t target Chinese citizens for spreading the banned phrase. And, due to the immutability of its distributed ledger, the message, once sent, can’t be erased.

Activists can receive one Reigning Emperor token for free as long as they pay gas, and can receive 8,640 Reigning Emperor tokens for every 1 ETH they spend. The proceeds go towards an activist organization in China.

The smart contract, to date, has processed just a handful of transactions. But just as people “needed Occupy Wall Street, even if they didn't know it,” White says that “activists need Ethereum, even if they don't know it right now.” Perhaps White’s prescience is worth paying attention to, Occupy Wall Street started with around 300 people, before spreading to 82 countries and a thousand cities. “Part of the point here is to call on other activists and be like, let's release things.”

White says that you’d better act fast: “Crypto’s in that golden moment—or maybe it's already ending—where people are drawn to the community because they think that this is a new form of changing the world that hasn't been tried before,” he said at DEVCON. “There's a window of opportunity that closes—and it might be closing now—where suddenly people start to think that this isn't a space where change is possible.”

Bigger and better

But even if the future of activism isn’t in crypto, blockchain technology has inspired other schools of thought, says Zoe Hitzig, a Ph.D. economist at Harvard. Blockchain has “opened up [the] imagination to thinking about a kind of parallel universe in which people can redefine their social relations to each other,” she says.

“Academic economists have very limited ways of talking about the mixture of centralized and decentralized decision making: [in] traditional political economy, there’s the market, which is decentralized, and then the state, which is centralized.”

“Blockchain is a kind of testing ground in that it offers new ways for thinking about the relationship between centralized and decentralized decision making.”

Along with the creator of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin, and star economist Glen Weyl, Hitzig last year produced a blueprint for a new system for funding public good, called “Liberal Radicalism.”

Here’s how it works: if a government wants to match a contribution by some individual to some public good, the total funding has to be the square of the sum of the square roots of the individual contributions. So, if I put a dollar towards a new public library, you give $4, and Buterin gives $9, then the public would match that total figure by $14.

Confused? “The significance of it is that it overcomes this information problem and the free-rider problem”—where someone in a community chooses not to donate on the presumption that someone richer would donate at the same time. It gets people to donate, since they know that their contributions are going to be matched,” says Hitzig. Through the new system, those without much money still get a say, because their donation—essentially an expression of how much they care about an issue—is matched by a wealthy patron. Those who donate more than others, still get a greater say over where funds are allocated, but, because matching is calculated quadratically, it’s going to cost you more to express your preference.

Hitzig says Liberal Radicalism could provide a whole new system of taxation. “The existing system is mixing voluntary and involuntary contributions through taxes and subsidies to public goods in really mysterious ways that aren't well defined. It doesn't lead to a clear incentive structure that links up how people are spending their money with what public goods are funded. And that pretty much makes people hate paying taxes.”

Though Hitzig’s tax-utopia remains a pipe dream, this blockchain-inspired form of governance has already been enacted through something called quadratic voting. The premise is the same as quadratic financing—where larger donations are matched with more money, but smaller donations are still significant.

In quadratic voting, members of a group—for the sake of argument, a government—are allocated a certain number of votes to spend on projects. If, say, each member of government is allocated a hundred votes to distribute amongst ten bills, then allocating all hundred votes to one bill would mean a particular bill is more likely to pass—but you’d be defeated by a bunch of others spending only a few votes. Remember, because votes are calculated quadratically, the value of a vote decreases. Plugging two votes into a project actually costs you four votes, and to designate three votes to a project, you’d have to spend nine of your hundred votes.

The US state of Colorado has used quadratic voting to vote on its budget priorities, and Taiwan’s Presidential Hackathon has adopted the quadratic voting system this year, too. Taiwan’s Digital Minister, Audrey Tang, attributes the idea to “blockchain people” like Vitalik Buterin. Blockchain companies have also taken up the call: Eximchain, a blockchain focused on helping supply chains share information, last year integrated quadratic voting into its protocol.

If White’s adversarial smart contracts never take off, Bitcoin crashes, and everyone gives up trying to track scallops and rocks on the blockchain, blockchain’s lasting legacy could be in its contribution to new types of social organization. Thanks, Nakamoto.",2019-11-24 14:16:03,,,,,,

Bitcoin started the day just above the $7,100 price mark, at which point the world’s largest crypto coin bounced off a local low of $6,560, before moving up again to its current trading price near $7,150. After a tumultuous 24 hours, BTC is showing a minor gain of just under 1% on the day.

BTC is down around 12% from the weekly open of $8,100, while, over the month, investors have lost around $1,800 per coin.

Bitcoin could spend months trading at $5,500

Commodities trader and technician Peter Brandt recently revealed his belief that BTC could spend months trading at $5,500 before it recovers. The veteran trader became best known as being one of the first analysts who accurately predicted the end of the bull run in December 2017.

“My target of $5,500 is not far below today's low. But I think the surprise might be in the duration and nature of the market,” he wrote. Brandt continued:

“I am thinking about a low in July 2020. That will wear out bulls quicker than a price correction.”

Well-known statistician and analyst Willy Woo, together with crypto trader Tone Vays, echoed similar sentiments when they said that the threat still remains that Bitcoin will hit $4,500.

Regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb added his opinion to the mix of negative sentiments, saying that for him now was a time to be risk-off:

“I’m totally back in cash now. There doesn’t seem to be obvious sign of reversal. Going to sit on the sidelines until there is more indication.”

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, saw a painful drop in sync with BTC during recent days. The number-one altcoin bounced of its daily low at $134, before moving up to its current trading price of $147 per coin. Ether is showing a mild gain of around 0.7% on the day.

XRP, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, continues to lose ground and currently sits at $0.220 per coin, showing a loss of more than 3% at press time.

Mixed signals among the top 20

Many of the top 20 coins are showing mild signs of recovery, with Cosmos (ATOM) taking the lead, up more than 4% on the day. Monero (XMR) comes in second place with a gain of around 2.2% at press time. Tezos (XTZ) takes the title of biggest loser, seeing a loss of nearly 9% on the day.

Raoul Paul of Real Vision holds an interview with founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Barry Silbert, who is a pioneer in the cryptocurrency market and digitalization of financial assets. Despite the series of booms and busts, the narrative around crypto regarding its future place within the global financial system remains unchanged after the price of bitcoin inked a parabolic surge throughout 2017.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have already changed how investors think about the crypto asset class and not just for speculation, says Barry, but also for its store of value characteristics. Barry tells Raoul Paul his controversial opinion how he believes investors will replace gold in their portfolios with bitcoin over the next couple decades as the utility (i.e. benefits) of crypto trumps that of gold and other precious metals. Yet, others still argue how bullion remains attractive.

The market cap of Bitcoin has ballooned from a few billion dollars back in 2014 to the $130 billion total value of Bitcoin circulating currently. Barry, who was on the forefront of skyrocketing btc prices when the cryptocurrency was trading around $300, argues that the crypto asset class is here to stay in light of the growing financial infrastructure and global acceptance.

Bitcoin trading has become increasingly popular, for example, which has provided liquidity for the digital currency. In fact, cryptocurrency speculators will soon start to trade US regulated bitcoin derivatives such as futures and options contracts. The expanding financial infrastructure could facilitate access for additional traders to enter the crypto market and potentially open up the door to institutional investors.

Yet, Barry points out that the crypto asset class journey is not straightforward. The use case for bitcoin and blockchain is still under development, but there is great potential to be unlocked. As such, the primary use case for bitcoin and crypto is speculation – that is not necessarily a bad thing. In order for bitcoin to reach its potential utility the size of the crypto asset class needs to continue to grow alongside expanding volume and velocity of transactions, which benefits from speculation.

This increases the liquidity of bitcoin as it is exchanged in and out of different currencies. Buying into the hypothesis that bitcoin will replace gold is the belief that there will be a convergence between the $8 trillion gold market and $125 billion bitcoin market. Bitcoin bulls are also betting on the possibility that substantial technological advancements might be made with blockchain technology, which could potentially become intertwined with the underpinnings of the global financial system.

What Happened

The crypto market has been experiencing a downtrend over the last week, with major cryptocurrencies being in the red. Bitcoin has dropped to $6,930, at press time, losing more than 20% in the last seven days. Ethereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, dropped to $136 Monday morning, the lowest point since April, now settled at $143.

Analysts in the crypto space, famous for their ""hodl,"" or not shorting digital assets, philosophy believe that the downtrend might continue.

But why?

There are different speculations over the reasons behind the recent fall. Bloomberg reported Monday that China's recent decision on cryptocurrency operations might be the cause of the downtrend.

Oliver Renick, Lead Anchor at TD Ameritrade Network, thinks that prices are down because people are starting to realize they ""don't need bitcoin.""

But historically, as Director of Research at a crypto publication the Block, Larry Cermak pointed out, that price spikes in the crypto space are ""not related to any particular event or trend.""",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/25/bitcoin-sinks-to-a-6-month-low-as-china-accelerates-crackdown.html,"What a tough month it has been for bitcoin.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency sank to $6,558.14 on Monday, its lowest level since May, according to industry site CoinDesk. It lost $3,000 in value in just a month as China accelerated a crackdown on businesses involved in cryptocurrency operations, a reversal from President Xi Jinping's previous signal to be more open to the blockchain technology. The coin last traded at $7,150.79.

Bitcoin jumped to above $10,000 briefly last month after Xi sang the praises of blockchain in a speech and called on his country to advance development in the field. However, on Friday, China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, pledged to continue to target exchanges and asked investors to be wary of digital currencies.

Beijing has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies, banning a fundraising exercise known as an initial coin offering and forcing local trading platforms to shut down in 2017.

""This was one of the worst weeks in the history of digital assets,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca, told CNBC. ""The market is clearly in contraction, with no new money coming in to soak up the supply.""

Still, bitcoin has doubled in price since the beginning of the year, marking a significant turnaround from last year, when the digital coin tanked to as low as $3,122. It got a boost this summer after Facebook announced its own planned libra cryptocurrency, which analysts say has contributed to positive sentiment around bitcoin and boosted its price.

Bitcoin has a history of strong comebacks from big sell-offs, Dorman noted. The cryptocurrency gained 70% in the four months following a 16% loss in 2016 and similarly an 89% gain in the four months after a 22% sell-off in 2015, Dorman said.

Bitcoin is nowhere near its all-time high, near $20,000 in December 2017.

— CNBC's Kate Rooney and Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",2019-11-25,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-markets-overreaction-to-xis-blockchain-remark-prompts-tougher-crackdown,"Call it a self-defeating prophecy.

When President Xi Jinping praised blockchain technology as an opportunity that China should pounce on last month, many took it as an auspicious sign for the cryptocurrency market in the world’s second-largest economy.

This rosy interpretation led to the return of speculative fever surrounding not just major cryptocurrencies but also alleged crypto pump-and-dump schemes.

But that, in turn, has triggered another crackdown by local regulators, targeting exchanges, projects, media as well as blockchain and crypto-themed events – and dashing hopes for a crypto-friendly China.

After rallying as much as 30 percent within hours of Xi’s speech, the price of bitcoin has fallen back to a level even lower than it was before his remarks and dipped to a six-month low below $7,000 on Monday.

“I’ve called out countless time[s] already the initial pump is totally a[n] over-reaction, so a correction is well expected especially under the known CCP ‘carrot and stick’ strategy.” tweeted Dovey Wan, a founding partner at Primitive Ventures.

In what has become a defining episode of the clampdown, crypto news site The Block reported last week that Binance’s Shanghai office had shut down. The exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, initially denied that it even had an office in Shanghai, and took umbrage at the publication’s claim there had been a “police raid.”

The Block later softened the phrase to “visit by authorities,” but sources told CoinDesk that Binance has indeed had a presence in Shanghai for some time.

Dragon Television, a Shanghai local broadcast station, aired in a program on Monday night China time that Binance’s Shanghai office was closed and added the office was used by outsourced customer service staff and some developers.

'Air coins'

The local community was briefly rejuvenated by the leader’s remarks.

From Nov. 8 to 9, more than 4,000 people attended the World Blockchain Conference in Wuzhen, China, according to the event organizer 8btc. Speakers included representatives from traditional tech firms like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as well as those working in crypto exchanges, funds, projects and mining businesses.

Further supporting an optimistic outlook, a few days after Xi’s speech, the country’s top economic planning agency scrapped a proposal that would have recommended eliminating crypto mining from China, a global hub for such activity.

But then Beijing began tightening the screws.

On Nov. 14, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) Shanghai Bureau issued a notice to local government agencies in each district in the city to inspect and clear out businesses that offer crypto trading, fundraising, promotion and brokerage services. It later officially published the notice on its website, stating that it plans to nip the growing crypto fever in the bud.

And apparently, this is a nationwide effort. On Thursday, the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau issued a similar notice, vowing to crack down on initial coin offerings and fraudulent schemes that use blockchain as a marketing gimmick without any technological substance.

China Central Television (CCTV), a mouthpiece of the Chinese government, said in an article on Sunday that this is just the beginning as multiple cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou have all started taking similar measures.

To be sure, the crackdown has so far primarily targeted at what the state media called “air coins,” referring to those that are issued out of thin air without any real team or development, as well as smaller exchanges that would pump and dump these coins’ prices.

A Chinese government-backed report last week even claimed that 25,000 out of the 28,000 blockchain firms based in the country issued cryptocurrencies via illegal fundraising channels.

As a result, multiple state-owned media including CCTV, Xinhua, Economic Information Daily, and Securities Times, have all published news coverage over the past week to their nationwide audience about the return of “air coins” and the country’s crackdown efforts.

‘Safety concerns’

Meanwhile, trading services of major exchanges by volume such as Huobi, OKEx and Binance, which still serve Chinese investors, have not been affected by the crackdown so far.

That said, there are signs that these trading platforms have taken a step back, at least for the time being, in terms of their operations, marketing and promotional activities.

For instance, OKEx’s official Chinese-language Weibo account had been regularly posting daily updates of cryptocurrency market analysis, announcements regarding listing certain tokens and its Jumpstart initial exchange offering activities.

Yet since Nov. 14, the firm’s Weibo account has so far been only publishing posts on blockchain 101, and news coverage about blockchain applications.

On the other hand, the official Weibo accounts of Binance and blockchain project Tron, are still suspended, due to user complaints of violating laws, regulations or Weibo’s service terms.

Further, many of the blockchain and crypto-themed events originally scheduled in Shanghai in recent weeks had been either canceled or scaled down, according to two event organizers, who spoke under the condition of anonymity due to safety concerns.

One organizer said the wave of cancelations was due to either safety reasons or venue providers declined to collaborate amid the crackdown news, even though the events were to discuss blockchain tech and crypto-economics in general.

The other organizer said events or meet-ups that did go ahead also tuned down the scale by making it invite-only or nixing panels related to trading.

The crackdown on exchanges and projects that are promoting speculation has also led to WeChat’s ban of several accounts that publish content about crypto trading to subscribers.",2019-11-25 16:50:20+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/89-of-chinese-blockchain-firms-have-tried-to-issue-crypto-report,"89% of China’s blockchain firms have allegedly tried to create their own cryptocurrency, according to a senior exec at a local blockchain association.

According to the state-run CCTV on Nov. 21, Yedong Zhu, the president of the Beijing Blockchain Technology Application Association (BBAA), revealed that the vast majority of blockchain industry in China is focused on tokens, not blockchain.

In addition to Zhu’s remarks, the report by CCTV covered a new study led by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC).

Co-authored by five local financial and technology authorities, the “Bluebook on Blockchain” report reveals that there are 28,000 blockchain enterprises in China.

The authors of the “bluebook” included the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Payment and Clearing Association of China, the Beijing Blockchain Technology Application Association and Social Sciences Academic Press.

BBAA president: 4,000 out of 28,000 Chinese DLT firms are focused on pure DLT

According to the BBAA president, only 4,000 Chinese blockchain companies are focused on pure blockchain technology, while as many as 25,000 have purportedly tried to issue their own cryptocurrency or token.

The news comes amidst the recently sparked Chinese push into blockchain technology development, which was triggered by President Xi Jinping’s call to embrace blockchain in October.

The push was accompanied by a renewed wave of pressure on local crypto-related businesses. On Nov. 21, the PBoC's Shanghai unit announced it was taking action against entities allegedly involved in trading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC). On Nov. 22, authorities in Shenzhen province claimed that 39 exchanges fell afoul of China’s cryptocurrency trading ban.

State-led publications have emphasized that the country’s blockchain push should be limited purely to blockchain technology, and not include cryptocurrency-related initiatives.

The United States Attorney’s Office of the Central District of California announced on Nov. 22 that Dennis Blieden had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft. Blieden embezzled over $22 million from his employer and used the stolen funds to buy cryptocurrency, gamble and cover personal expenses.

Abuse of authority

At the time, Blieden served at StyleHaul Inc., a digital marketing agency that represents “influencers'' on social media platforms, as the controller and vice president of accounting and finance. Blieden’s position gave him access and control over the firm’s bank accounts.

Over the course of four years — from October 2015 to March 2019 — Blieden stole $1.2 million to write personal checks to poker players, $1.1 million to pay off his credit cards, and $8.4 million to transfer to his cryptocurrency accounts. The release further explains:

“To conceal his scheme, Blieden made fraudulent entries in StyleHaul’s accounting records, falsely representing that the illegal wire transfers he made were authorized payments of money due to StyleHaul clients. Blieden also falsely indicated on one of StyleHaul’s bank accounts that wire transfers to Blieden’s personal bank account were “equity” draws that the company owed him. [...] Blieden created fictitious wire transfer letters that purported to be from Western Union and were designed to make it appear that he had caused wire transfers from StyleHaul to pay money it purportedly owed to a client.”

Blieden is now facing a statutory maximum sentence of 22 years in federal prison.

Thompson, a resident of Easton, Pennsylvania, is charged with “knowingly or recklessly making false representations to customers in connection with the purported purchase of Bitcoins (BTC) worth over $7 million.”

You often hear the word “cryptocurrency” in the same sentence as “bitcoin” and “blockchain.” But can you explain each term?

Bitcoin

The first thing you need to understand is that blockchain ≠ bitcoin.

(Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP via Getty Images)

“Blockchain is a technology, while bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are applications of that technology,” said Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, managing director of operations at Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange.

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it’s certainly the most well known, but it’s just one of many cryptocurrencies that exist today.

Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital asset. “It’s a new way of thinking about a store of value,” said Hightower-Sillittio.

(Jack Taylor/Getty Images)

The thing underpinning value in our current financial system, the one we’re used to, is trust. If you buy something online, say from Amazon, you have to trust that dollars will get added to Amazon’s bank account and subtracted from yours. You also have to trust that the U.S. dollar, even if it’s just a digital dollar in your bank account, is worth something.

The promise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is making that transaction happen without the banks, without the credit card companies and without the U.S. dollar. Instead of trust, cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology.

Blockchain

“You can think of blockchain technology as kind of like a Google spreadsheet,” said Laura Shin, a cryptocurrency journalist and podcaster. A Google spreadsheet, unlike old-fashioned Excel spreadsheet, can be viewed by multiple people at the same time.

Like a list of transactions on a spreadsheet, a blockchain is a ledger. “However, it is a very new and novel type of ledger and definitely improved upon the ledgers of yore, which, primarily, have been individual ledgers,” said Shin.

You can think of those old-fashioned individual ledgers, like the record each bank keeps of its customers funds, as an old-fashioned Excel spreadsheet — the kind you have to save and send every time there’s an update.

“Let’s say I was going to make a payment to you via credit card, or check, or Venmo, or whatever,” said Shin. “Then our different banks would each have to update their own ledgers.” In that scenario, you have to trust third parties to keep the record straight.

“With a blockchain, you have just one ledger, and anybody in the world can look at the state of this ledger at any given time,” said Shin.

Instead of multiple copies of a ledger that live on multiple banks’ servers, a blockchain is just one ledger that lives on everyone’s server. It’s distributed across the network. “And so essentially you’re replacing these trusted third parties with software,” said Shin.

Blockchain is bigger than bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

“Bitcoin was the first and a very important use case, but blockchain itself has many, many use cases,” said Sandra Ro, chief executive of the Global Blockchain Business Council, an industry association for blockchain technology.

Blockchain technology is being tested and put to use in healthcare, public services, food safety and a range of other industries. Whether you care about investing in cryptocurrencies or not, you’re probably going to keep hearing about it.

CNBC’s Brian Kelly called it “an important low” commenting on bitcoin price movement on Friday at FastMoney CNBC. He believes that growth in bitcoin addresses by 5% over the previous 30 days is a good sign and that “the fundamentals are improving on a selloff.”

But Why?

There are different speculations over the reasons behind the recent fall. Bloomberg reported Monday that China’s recent decision on cryptocurrency operations might be the cause of the downtrend.

Oliver Renick, lead anchor at TD Ameritrade Network, thinks that prices are down because people are starting to realize they “don’t need bitcoin.”

But historically, as the director of research at crypto publication the Block, Larry Cermak, pointed out, price spikes in the crypto space are “not related to any particular event or trend.”

But this process has real-world impacts. Each $1 of Bitcoin value created in 2018 was responsible for $0.49 in health and climate damages in the U.S. and $0.37 in China, researchers report in a new study.

The reason is that cryptocurrency mining uses a lot of electricity. Moreover, because of the way most cryptocurrencies are structured, the more coins that have already been produced, the harder the mining algorithms are to solve — so the electricity requirements are constantly increasing, along with the associated damages.

Last year, researchers calculated the electricity use and corresponding carbon emissions for four of the most prominent cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. They found that Bitcoin mining alone used more electricity in 2017 than did all of Ireland or Hong Kong. Between the start of 2016 and mid-2018, the four cryptocurrencies together were responsible for between 3 and 15 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

The new study builds on those findings. Researchers at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque first collected data on emissions of various pollutants associated with each kilowatt hour of electricity generation in the United States and China, two countries where a lot of cryptocurrency mining occurs. They used this to calculate the health and climate impacts – which they term ‘cryptodamages’ – per coin created.

Their estimate of climate damage is based on carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity production. The estimate of health damages is based on exposure to fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, all of which are known to increase the risk of premature mortality. In some cases they extrapolated from more extensive U.S. data to make estimates for China.

In 2018, “the human health and climate damages caused by Bitcoin represented almost half of the financial value of each U.S. dollar of Bitcoin created,” the researchers write in the journal Energy Research & Social Science.

In China, climate change accounts for about 89% of cryptodamages, while the remaining 11% are due to human health effects. In the United States, about 60% of cryptodamages represent climate impacts and 40% health impacts.

This is because emissions associated with electricity production are higher in China than in the United States, but a measure that represents the economic losses from premature death is much lower (reflecting lower wages in China).

In fact, cryptocurrency mining in China takes a heavy toll in premature mortality. Every 50,000 Bitcoins mined in China are associated with 12 additional deaths due to particulate matter exposure, the researchers calculated.

Over time, the amount of electricity required to produce cryptocurrency coins has increased and the value of those coins has fluctuated. This means that mostly, the net benefit of cryptocurrencies to society has been eroding. In December 2018, damages from Bitcoin mining in the United States amounted to $0.95 for every $1 value of the coins.

It’s well known that, because of the ever-increasing effort required to mine coins, at some point a given cryptocurrency will no longer be profitable to mine. The researchers argue that it’s likely that the cryptocurrency’s social costs will outstrip its value well before that point of unprofitability.

Cryptocurrency miners tend to locate in areas with cheap electricity. But the cheapest electricity isn’t necessarily associated with the lowest environmental and health damages. And it’s hard to regulate and tax cryptocurrency mining in a way that would hold miners accountable for these damages. The development of new systems of cryptocurrency that aren’t so energy intensive could be a way to resolve this problem, the researchers suggest.

Travala Partners With Accommodation Aggregator Booking.com

During the last few years cryptocurrencies have been adopted by lots of companies, and crypto users can now spend their assets on all types of goods and services. The company Travala.com, launched in 2017, is an accommodation listings platform that covers a large selection of bookable places to stay like hotels, luxury resorts, apartments, hostels, and villas. Travala claims to offer prices that can be up to 40% cheaper than other prominent online booking platforms. Moreover, Travala accepts cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) for accommodation payments. Travala also accepts BTC, ETH, DASH, LTC, EOS, XLM, ADA, BNB, XMR, TRX, XRP, and the stablecoin DAI. On November 25, The firm’s CEO Matt Luczynski revealed that Travala has now partnered with the online travel aggregator Booking.com. Luczynski added:

This partnership allows our users to access Booking.com’s accommodation listings, as well as the listings from several other leading travel suppliers, which is a fantastic use case for our own AVA token and another huge step towards mass cryptocurrency adoption.

One of the Largest Crypto-Supporting Online Travel Agencies by Number of Bookable Hotels

Booking.com is an accommodation listing aggregator founded in 1996 and the latest partnership brings an additional 90,000 destinations to over 230 countries worldwide to the Travala platform. Luczynski stressed that customers using Travala.com can pay for accommodations with the firm’s native token AVA plus 20 other popular cryptos. Users who leverage AVA will obtain exclusive discounts and loyalty rewards. Travala’s CEO says that Booking.com has noticed the value of making its properties available to the swelling cryptocurrency markets. “Such a move by Booking.com is a sign that we are close to seeing the industry’s acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a standard form of payment for travel bookings,” Travala’s announcement underlined.

In recent years a variety of firms have introduced cryptocurrency-friendly online travel agencies to the public. In May, U.K.’s Corporate Traveller revealed that it accepts BTC and BCH for small to medium enterprises (SME) customers. Another startup called Cryptocribs provides a peer-to-peer short-term rental system that utilizes digital assets like bitcoin cash and ethereum for payments. With the holidays approaching, news.Bitcoin.com’s Lubomir Tassev described a slew of crypto supporting travel sites like Travala, Cheapair, Bitcoin.Travel, Travelbybit, Destinia, Greitai, and Airtreks. Still, the partnership with Booking.com makes Travala.com “one of the largest online travel agencies in the world by number of bookable hotels.”

“Booking.com’s support for Travala.com illustrates the confidence it shares in this fledgling online travel agency and its commitment to supporting digital technology that helps take the friction out of travel,” Travala’s announcement concluded.

For nearly every human being on the planet, it’s more important than children, mom, art, whatever. Technically, it’s a record of payment. It can be a currency, but it doesn’t need to be. For an abstract idea, both real and unreal, money is quite tangible. Money means your kids eat or go hungry. Money enables a bag of paper to be exchanged for a house full of appliances. Money can be sex. Money can be murder. Say “money” three times fast and it feels like a marble of vanilla ice cream rolling around on your tongue. And money is all kinds of emotional. It’s attached to self-worth, shame, and safety. The other morning I noticed my wallet had no more money in it, so I went to an ATM and a neurological reaction turned the feeling of ten pieces of paper in my hand into “happy,” “more relaxed,” “more secure,” all at once.

You may not know what money is, but you know what is money.

But now money’s changing, perhaps forever.

What is crypto? A couple years ago, crypto was the future, according to your cousin at Thanksgiving. It had something to do with Internet drugs in China? He couldn’t explain it very well; it sounded like another one of his schemes. But then, out of nowhere, crypto kind of was the future. Bitcoin bros the world over became millionaires. And then the bubble burst, everything went to hell, everyone consoled your cousin while breathing a sigh of relief, because crypto had disappeared, and none of you needed to figure out what the hell it had been. Only crypto didn’t disappear, it just went quiet. And this Thanksgiving, the evangelists will tell you it’s bigger, more relevant than ever, only they’re not just your cousin anymore. They’re the People’s Bank of China. They’re Mark Zuckerberg. Talking about crypto today is more like talking about the climate crisis. Forget real or unreal. It’s “how soon,” and “oh crap.”

Crypto is life. You just don’t know it yet.

The Rise and Rise of a Crypto King

Brian Kim is real, but that’s not his real name*. Kim immigrated to San Diego for graduate school in his early twenties. About a decade later, he is millennial in several ways that will be familiar to anyone watching recent sitcoms. He likes music and hanging out with friends. His parents have high expectations for him that he feels he does not quite fulfill. He doesn’t like his job and isn’t sure how it became his career, though it is lucrative: Kim is an elite academic coach with many clients who are wealthy, in some cases very, in a few cases ludicrously so, all of them quite happy to pay top dollar so their kids receive the best (legal) test prep that money can buy.

*In addition to providing this person with a pseudonym, certain identifying characteristics have also been changed.

Which is how Kim, by living in a small apartment (“very small”), minimizing his expenses, and subsisting on ramen packets for nearly a decade, managed to save a decent amount of money. And then suddenly become wealthy—very wealthy, even ludicrously so.

Kim heard about crypto from a friend I’ll call Derek*. “I think it was about 2013 or ’14,” Kim said. “[Derek] was like, ‘Hey, I’ve been looking into this and I really think maybe we should invest in some Bitcoin.’ ” Kim was intrigued, but he didn’t follow through. Like a lot of people, he’d heard about Bitcoin, the original crypto and still the OG, but it didn’t sound fully real. Then, in 2017, he tried buying some “altcoins.” An altcoin is essentially any cryptocurrency that isn’t Bitcoin; in October 2019, a database listed over three thousand of them. Some improve on Bitcoin’s core technology by offering more secrecy, or better security. Many are simply wannabes, copycats that inspire wildcat behavior, that get painted by the wide brush known as “shit-coin.” Still, some alts have outperformed Bitcoin itself; in 2017, a coin called XRP rose by 36,000 percent.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-progresses-bill-to-provide-legal-foundation-for-cryptocurrencies,"South Korea’s National Assembly is progressing a bill that will provide a legal basis for cryptocurrencies in the country. The bill categorizes virtual currencies as digital assets and intends to bring regulatory clarity and transparency to crypto markets in South Korea, English-language newspaper Korea JoongAng Daily reports on Nov. 27.

According to the report, the bill was passed by the National Assembly’s national policy committee and still needs to be approved by the judiciary committee. If approved, the law would come into force in 2020, the report notes.

All crypto businesses will have to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit

Under the bill, all crypto-related businesses in South Korea would be required to register with the Financial Services Commission’s (FSC) Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and report to the authority.

In order to be approved as a crypto firm in the country, crypto businesses will have to obtain an Information Security Management System certificate from the state-run Korea Internet and Security Agency, the report notes.

New bill aims to prevent money laundering and protect investors

The FSC stated that the legislation will make crypto markets more transparent and legitimize investment in digital assets. The authority stressed that the bill will require crypto-related businesses to prevent illicit practices such as money laundering.

Additionally, crypto firms will have to adopt their own monitoring systems for financial transactions in compliance with standards by the Financial Action Task Force. Those who fail to establish their own oversight systems will be penalized, the report notes.

The new bill is not the first attempt by South Korean authorities to provide an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) framework. In early 2018, South Korean regulators banned anonymous trading on crypto exchanges in line with AML and identification efforts in the country. The FSC subsequently released a set of revised AML guidelines for virtual currencies in June 2018.",,https://www.coindesk.com/another-crypto-exchange-is-dropping-privacy-coin-monero-over-compliance-risk,"A Northern European digital assets exchange is to delist the privacy-focused monero cryptocurrency to align with international anti-money-laundering standards.

Estonia-based BitBay announced Monday that monero (XML) will no longer be tradeable from Feb. 19, 2020. However, the crypto exchange is to cease deposits of XML as of this Friday, Nov. 29, and will block withdrawals temporarily from Friday to Dec. 5 around the time of a planned monero hard fork.

All users must withdraw any remaining XML by 20 May, 2020, according to the notice.

Explaining the move, BitBay said monero is being delisted due to its privacy features. The cryptocurrency uses tech called ring signatures that jumble up small groups of transactions to obfuscate individuals’ identities.

“The decision was made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks,” the firm said, adding that other crypto exchanges have dropped monero over the same concern.

“As a licenced exchange, BitBay has to follow the market standards. Compliance with market standards and regulations allows us to provide our clients with legal security and convenience of using the exchange, with the participation of a friendly banking system and the availability of payment operators,” BitBay said.

As mentioned, monero’s privacy protections have led to other trading platforms halting support in recent months. For example, OKEx Korea dropped XML, as well as horizen (ZEN) and super bitcoin (SBTC), in October. It said at the time it was reviewing a decision to delist zcash and dash as well.

Other privacy coins have been seen as too risky by some exchanges too. Coinbase dropped zcash from its U.K. platform in August. The move was likely a compliance push related to building a new banking relationship after being dropped by Barclays.",2019-11-26 12:20:00+00:00,https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/26/business/bitcoin-drop/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) It wasn't long ago that bitcoin looked like it was making a comeback. Recently, however, it has hit a speed bump.

Bitcoin's price came tumbling down Monday as it dropped to $6,558 at 1:00 a.m. EST, its lowest level in six months. (Since bitcoin is continuously traded, there is no closing price for it.)

The notoriously volatile cryptocurrency rebounded quickly, however, and reached $7,100 a few hours later on Monday. That's still better than when it traded below $4,000 at the beginning of the year. But since its peak on July 9, bitcoin prices have dropped more than 45%.

Only a few weeks ago, bitcoin experienced a nice rally, with prices more than doubling to a 2019 high of around $8,500.

One thing that may have added to investor confidence is that China appears to be taking more steps to embrace bitcoin. Chinese President Xi Jinping recently made bullish comments about the technology that acts as a ledger for bitcoin transactions, calling blockchain an ""important breakthrough.""

Indeed, while there are far more viable options for cryptocurrency custody than there have been at times of previous rejections, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton still raised his concerns regarding crypto custody just weeks before the decision to reject the application was made.

Discover iFX EXPO Asia 2020 in Macao – The Largest Financial B2B Expo

Indeed, Clayton told CNBC reporter Bob Pisani that while the crypto industry has come closer to satisfying the SEC’s concerns regarding custody, “there’s work left to be done.”

“How do we know that we can have custody and have a hold of these crypto assets? That’s a key question,” the Chairman asked.

Custody has always been a pain point for the industry–but are institutional investors using the viable custody options that are increasingly available?

Previously, in July, the SEC and FINRA issued a joint statement delineating their concerns about crypto custody: “the ability of a broker-dealer to comply with aspects of the Customer Protection Rule is greatly facilitated by established laws and practices regarding the loss or theft of a security, that may not be available or effective in the case of certain digital assets,” the statement read.

And indeed, though the situation has improved, a lack of viable crypto custody options has historically been a major pain point for the industry when it comes to institutional adoption. Indeed, a number of analysts have argued that once the right custody solutions are available, a wave of institutional capital could come rushing into the cryptosphere

However, although things have improved since 2018 (the institutional crypto custody space now has well-renowned participants like Fidelity, Coinbase, and ICE’s Bakkt), a recent study conducted by Binance Research found that institutional investors don’t seem to be using these custody services; instead, 92% of the institutional investors that responded to Binance’s survey said that they prefer to keep their crypto exactly where most experts least recommend–on centralized exchanges.

The vast majority of institutional investors keep their crypto on exchanges and hardly use third-party custody services, Binance Research survey says

Binance surveyed “76 participants across our English & Mandarin surveys, primarily composed of firms, funds, and institutions with respective allocations to cryptoassets ranging from $100K to more than $25M.”

And indeed, “exchanges remain as the most popular choice for cryptoasset storage amongst our institutional and VIP clients at 92.1%. When moving to self-storage, cold wallets are the second most favored choice, given their improved safety and control. Third-party custody services were the least popular option at 2.6%.”

The results of the survey are particularly surprising, given the fact that storing funds on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange is widely considered to be the least-safest way to store crypto. Indeed, cryptocurrency that is stored on an exchange is vulnerable to attacks by hackers, technical failures, or–in some circumstances–mishandling by the exchange itself.

There have been many examples of this: to name a few more recent and more extreme examples, Japan-based crypto exchange Coincheck was hacked for $530 million last year; also in 2018, QuadrigaCX CEO Gerald Cotten famously took the private keys to his exchange’s cold wallets with him to the grave. (Then, of course, there’s Mt Gox, BitGrail, Bithumb, and many, many more.)

Additionally, while most legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges have insurance or other kinds of contingency plans for restoring users’ lost funds should disaster strike, some do not–for example, most, if not all, QuadrigaCX users have yet to see a penny of what was lost to them.

So then–why do so many institutional investors seem to be leaving their funds at the mercy of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges?

Crypto’s “best practices” are still being built

Daniel Haudenschild, President of the Board of Directors at the Crypto Valley Association and CEO of SIBEX, a firm that creates new arbitrage opportunities for institutional traders, told Finance Magnates that while the survey’s results present “an impressive statistic,” it’s important to note that the results don’t take certain aspects of institutional crypto investing into account.

“Many companies are getting exposure to crypto through CFDs (contract for differences), tracking products, or ‘on-ledger’ trading solutions,” Haudenschild explained. “These solutions do not see actual on-chain transactions take place, so it is difficult to measure the exact exposure. It is clear, though, that there is significant exposure to centralized counterparties.”

Suggested articles Why Crypto Payments Can Change the WorldGo to article >>

That being said, however, Haudenschild told Finance Magnates that the apparent custodial over-reliance by institutional investors who do use cryptocurrency exchanges directly is simply a sign of the times: a new market that still has yet to truly establish best practices.

“The fact that most institutional investors trust centralized exchanges is indicative of the immaturity of the market,” Haudenschild said. “High-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) are pushing their financial institutions for access to crypto against a backdrop of prolonged negative interest rates.”

Therefore, “few institutional investors have had the foresight to invest in the necessary infrastructure and talent to handle the demand. Many are now playing catch-up, using tactical interim steps to do so.”

But the consequences of this interim period could be severe. “Utilising centralized functions for storage is not recommended for crypto as it introduces significant unnecessary counterparty risk,” Haudenschild said. “This behavior shows clearly that many investors do not yet understand this market and struggle to identify the risk vectors and severity associated with digital assets. The learning curve will be steep as loss events take down entire ecosystems.”

”Most traders use cryptocurrency as a tool for profiting off of the price volatility, not for the underly properties of peer-to-peer trading.”

Kiara Bickers, author of Bitcoin Clarity: A Guide to Understanding, told Finance Magnates that the apparent reliance of institutional traders on cryptocurrency exchanges could simply be a marker of the kind of trading that institutions are engaged in within the space.

Indeed, Bickers said that the results of the survey were unsurprising “most traders use cryptocurrency as a tool for profiting off of the price volatility, not for the underly properties of peer-to-peer trading,” she said. “Traders can’t functionally trade if their funds aren’t on the exchange at all times.”

Economist Alex Krüger made a similar point on Twitter following the launch of Van Eck’s “BTC”, a sort of pseudo-crypto ETF that received almost no interest from institutional investors.

And it could very well be that that the kinds of institutional investors who are currently interested in Bitcoin and other kinds of crypto assets are not the type who would necessarily utilize third-party custodial services as long-term solutions: “institutional money already trades lots of bitcoin …. just not the type of institutions who are long term holders,” he wrote.

Institutional money already trades lots of bitcoin …. just not the type of institutions who are long term holders. — Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) September 30, 2019

“They place trust in their wealth and asset managers as they have for generations. Which is ok, until it isn’t.”

Therefore, it’s possible that the longer-term solution to crypto’s custody battle may be to improve custody on cryptocurrency exchanges, or to integrate third-party solutions into them. “I’d like to see exchanges publish more detailed reports on how they’re managing their cold storage….Right now there isn’t much consumer demand pressing for the knowledge on how their funds are being stored, but there should be,” Bickers said.

However, Haudenschild said that the current situation is that although “custody is often provided for ‘free’ with trading accounts,” trading platforms tend to “focus primarily on increasing trading volume, and secondarily on hack-proof custody.”

But the onus to solve crypto’s custody problem cannot be placed completely on cryptocurrency exchanges– at the very least, there are several different points at which various financial cultures must change their behavior.

“Now that investment into digital assets has grown beyond the early adopters and tech enthusiasts, in many cases, the retail investors are driving the institutional investors. However, few HNW and Ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) individuals understand the space well enough to manage their own infrastructure,” Haudenshild said.

“They place trust in their wealth and asset managers as they have for generations. Which is ok, until it isn’t.”

Therefore, “it would be good if this statistic (92%) is an interim step,” he said. “One would hope institutions offering exposure are also taking the strategic steps to provide in-house custody.”

Haudenschild pointed out that providing in-house will require a serious culture change in asset management: “most financial services companies have been spending the last ten years moving into a cloud architecture. Digital assets is one place where this trend is starting to reverse. Crypto is one area where companies should be maintaining their own in-house, on premise, custody solutions.”

”The most effective move centralized exchanges can make is to invest in decentralized solutions.”

However, the ultimate solution to crypto’s custody conundrum may eventually be to move away from the centralized model completely.

“Centralized exchanges, like brokers, are an interim step to market adoption,” Haudenschild said. “Centralized exchanges perpetuate a model with a fatal flaw; they need to grow to get liquidity, and the more they grow, the more they become more of a honeypot for hackers, and subsequently, they become more of a target for regulators.”

“This not only increases the cost profile but it is also a model that is pockmarked with major loss events that can close out entire markets from crypto investments,” he continued. “The market is moving towards decentralized infrastructure and peer-to-peer trading. The most effective move centralized exchanges can make is to invest in decentralized solutions.”

These decentralized solutions would automatically place the responsibility of custody in the hands of the investor themself or of their appointed third-party custodian. While self-storage carries its own set of risks, even for institutional investors, the mantra rings true–",2019-11-26 11:25:59+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/luno-reopens-crypto-exchange-in-malaysia-amid-regulatory-approval/,"Crypto exchange Luno on Tuesday has relaunched its digital asset trading services in Malaysia after receiving approval from the Securities Commission (SC) of Malaysia.

Exile from the region

Luno first set up operations in Malaysia in 2015. However, due to resistance in the region from regulators and banks, it wrapped up its operations from southeast Asia and moved its base to London and was operating under the regulatory sandbox of the UK Financial Conduct Authority to test its crypto-based remittance service using British pounds.

It also expanded its presence in Europe and Africa over the years.

Meanwhile, the crypto exchange is also planning to resume its operations in Singapore and opened two corporate bank accounts in the city-state crucial for its operations.

By working with our clients we aim to make sure they can safely buy, sell and store Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as future digital assets that are approved by the SC.

According to Cointelegraph contributor Horus Hughes, Bitcoin could jump to $7,800, and even up to $8,100, before the coin encounters any significant overhead resistance. Hughes pointed out that Bitcoin had to close above the former support turned resistance at $7,400, for Bitcoin to push its price closer to the $7,800 resistance.

Hughes added that it seems unlikely that Bitcoin price will drop to $5,000 area again, but that it’s always good to consider bullish and bearish scenarios. “One would like to think that a drop to $5,500 will be avoided if bulls can keep the price above $7,300 and $6,700,” he wrote.

Commodities trader and technician Peter Brandt previously revealed his belief that BTC could spend months trading at $5,500 before it recovers.

Meanwhile, Ether (ETH) continues to trade in sync with BTC. The top altcoin bounced off its daily low of $143 before moving up to its current trading price of around $154 per coin. Ether is showing a modest gain of around 3.3% at press time.

Cointelegraph contributor Rakesh Upadhyay said that if the bulls can propel Ether’s price above $151.83, the coin will pick up momentum and possibly see trading levels around the $173 price mark.

XRP, the third-largest coin by market capitalization, is also following today’s trend and currently sits at $0.225 to show a gain of more than 2% for the day. But the coin is looking weak, with one trader going as far as predicting that the coin could hit zero by February 2020.

Top 20 coins continue to trade in the green

The majority of top 20 coins continue to show signs of recovery, with Monero (XMR) taking the lead by going up more than 8% for the day. It is followed by Cardano (ADA) and Tron (TRX), showing gains of around 6.7% and 5% respectively.

Chainlink (LINK) is the only of the top 20 coins to see a loss today, down 2%.

As Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young tweeted on Nov. 27:

“The ‘hacker’ timed when UPbit was making crypto transfers to its cold wallet (other alts like TRON, etc.). Hence, I think the probability of it being an inside job is higher than external breach.”

Hacker’s timing was advantageous

As Cointelegraph reported, the incident was confirmed in an official statement published earlier today, which read:

“At 1:06 PM on November 27, 2019, 342,000 ETH (approximately 58 billion won) were transferred from the Upbeat Ethereum Hot Wallet to an unknown wallet. Unknown wallet address is 0xa09871AEadF4994Ca12f5c0b6056BBd1d343c029.”

In its statement, the exchange emphasized that it deemed the 342,000 ETH transaction to be the only irregular transaction on the ledger, alluding to a number of other large-scale transfers that it said were related to the exchange moving assets between hot and cold storage wallets.

As data published by large-scale crypto transaction tracker Whale Alert has revealed, the 342,000 ETH transaction was followed by a series of major transfers of Tron (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens.

While the ETH, TRX and BTT transactions were transferred to an unknown wallet, subsequent Stellar (XLM), OMG and EOS transfers were made from Upbit to crypto exchange Bittrex.

Taking Upbit’s statement about cold storage transfers at face value, Young has argued for the strong possibility than an exchange employee took advantage of the timing of the storage transfers to perpetrate the theft.

Upbit today pledged to cover all user assets with corporate funds and exchange deposits and withdrawals will reportedly take at least two weeks to resume.

Markets react to exchange hack

Cryptocurrency markets have seemingly reacted to news of the incident, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $7,000 once again in an already fragile market climate.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has tweeted that the exchange will “work with Upbit and other industry players to ensure any hacked funds that may make their way to Binance are immediately frozen.”

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the theft of 14 billion won ($13 million) in cryptocurrency from major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb was believed by executives to be the work of an insider.",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-upbit-confirms-theft-of-49m-in-ether,"South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has lost cryptocurrency worth $49 million, the exchange has confirmed.

Upbit’s CEO said in a blog post at 9:00 UTC on Wednesday that an abnormal transaction from its wallets had resulted in the outflow of 342,000 ether (ETH) earlier today.

The exchange said the loss will be covered by its own assets. Meanwhile, withdrawals and deposits have already been suspended as a precaution. The firm estimated that it will take “at least two weeks” for services to be back to normal.

According to transaction tracking site Whale Alert, the lost ether – worth $49 million at press time – was sent from Upbit’s wallet to an unknown ethereum address starting with 0xa09871 about 04:00 UTC on Wednesday.

About 30 minutes later, Upbit announced that it had temporarily suspended withdrawals and deposits “due to server maintenance.”

In fact, more than $100 million worth of multiple cryptocurrencies have been sent out from Upbit today. However, the exchange said all other transactions, apart from the abnormal ethereum outflow, were the exchange moving cryptos from hot wallets to cold wallets to prevent further losses.

Starting from around 5:00 UTC, 10 transactions, each of $1.51 million-worth of tron (TRX), as well as $3.5 million in BitTorrent (BTT), were further sent to unknown blockchain addresses, according to Whale Alert.

After that, transactions of $8.7 million-worth of stellar (XLM), $1.08 million in OmiseGo (OMG), $22 million in EOS, and $3.4 million in status (SNT) were further transacted from Upbit’s wallets to those of the Bittrex crypto exchange.",2019-11-27 09:27:46+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-crypto-related-fraud-and-theft-resulted-in-44b-loss-in-2019,"In 2019, the total volume of cryptocurrency-related fraud and theft resulted in losses worth $4.4 billion, according to CipherTrace’s report for the third quarter of 2019.

In its “Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering Report, 2019 Q3,” security research firm CipherTrace delved into the 120 most popular cryptocurrency exchanges’ compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements and analyzed patterns in crypto-related crimes.

Decline in crypto crime volume and weak KYC standards

Per the report, Q3 2019 saw a notable reduction in total cryptocurrency crimes as compared with previous quarters, and thus the lowest quarterly thefts and scams in two years:

“This quarter, cybercriminals stole $6.5 million from cryptocurrency exchanges, while insiders bilked cryptocurrency users out of $9 million in exit scams and Ponzi schemes. This total of $15.5 million represents the smallest number of cryptocurrency crimes of any quarter in the past several years.”

However, total losses from crypto theft on the year have sky-rocketed since 2018, as crypto thieves go after larger sums. Crypto thefts accounted for $4.4 billion in losses, up from $1.7 billion the year previously.

Two particular scams, the PlusToken scheme ($2.9 billion) and the QuadrigaCX crypto exchange fiasco ($195 million) accounted for the vast majority of losses.

Out of the 120 analyzed crypto exchanges, 35% have strong KYC standards, 41% have “porous” standards and 24% have weak KYC standards. 32% of the top-120 exchanges trade privacy coins.

Recent high-profile crypto fraud cases

Cyber criminals are developing new and more sophisticated methods to obfuscate the flow of funds. On Nov. 26, Slovakian software security firm Eset discovered that cybercriminals behind the Stantinko botnet have been distributing a Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency mining module via Youtube. This crypto-stealing malware has reportedly infected around 500,000 devices.

Earlier today, major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit — which is run by a subsidiary of Korean tech giant Kakao — notified users of the theft of 342,000 Ether (ETH) (over $50 million at press time) from its hot wallet. The exchange pledged to protect user assets, stating that the lost funds will be covered by corporate assets.

Earlier this month, Gregg Bennett, a SIM-swap hack victim and angel investor, sued cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex over allegedly allowing the theft of nearly $1 million in Bitcoin (BTC).",,https://news.bitcoin.com/european-crypto-exchange-bitbay-ends-monero-trading-due-to-anonymity-features/,"European Crypto Exchange Bitbay Ends Monero Trading due to Anonymity Features

Authorities around the world are trying to stamp out online anonymity in various ways, sacrificing users’ privacy for alleged security. One of these ways is forcing digital asset exchanges to drop support for some cryptos, as European venue Bitbay is now the latest to do with monero.

Bitbay Drops Monero Support

European cryptocurrency exchange, Bitbay, has announced its decision to terminate support for the privacy-focused coin monero (XMR). The company will stop accepting deposits in XMR on 29 November, 2019 and the end of trading will take place on 19 February, 2020. All monero holders are asked to withdraw it from Bitbay by 20 May, 2020 at the latest. The given reason for the move is security concerns over monero’s anonymity features that might interfere with the company’s compliance with regulations.

Founded in 2014 in Katowice, Poland, Bitbay is said to have over 200 employees and 800,000 users. In May 2018 the exchange moved to Malta and on November 1, 2019, Pinewood Estonia became the operator of the platform, with a license to operate the cryptocurrency exchange in Estonia.

“Monero (XMR) can selectively utilize anonymity features among projects. This feature of XMR is a subject to end of transaction support,” the exchange explained to its users. “The decision was made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks. Monero (and other cryptocurrencies with this specification) has been already delisted on other fiat-crypto exchanges for the same reason. As a licensed exchange, Bitbay has to follow the market standards. Compliance with market standards and regulations allows us to provide our clients with legal security and convenience of using the exchange, with the participation of a friendly banking system and the availability of payment operators.”

Authorities Try to Stamp Out Online Anonymity

Bitbay is only the latest digital assets trading company to shun away from privacy coins. Over the past two years, service providers all over the world have taken similar moves. The Japanese exchange Coincheck announced that it will stop dealing with monero, dash and zcash in March 2018, Coinbase removed zcash from its UK venue in August and Okex delisted a number of privacy-coins in Korea in September. Exchanges are forced to take these moves to keep their operating licenses and not get their accounts blocked by the banks.

The reasons that the authorities, such as central bankers, Europol, and the FATF, usually give for singling out privacy-coins is that they can be used for money laundering, buying drugs, financing terror and other criminal activities. Privacy advocates, on the other hand, see it as a wider push to limit anonymity online that also includes banning encryption and demanding software companies implement back doors to spy on users. This is why they believe it is important to add privacy features to more popular cryptocurrencies.

Traditional payment provider tap into the frenzy

That strategy is expected to pay off, as it not only makes things much easier to exchange cryptocurrencies but also lessens the need to connect users with the traditional banking infrastructure.

In addition to Skrill, Paysafe’s brand portfolio now includes NETELLER and MeritCard, Paysafecard, payolution, Income Access, and FANS Entertainment. The company has enabled the crypto offering to Skrill’s wallets earlier in July 2018.

Every holiday conversation about cryptocurrency over the last few years boils down to one question: Should I buy some?

Whether your grandma corners you in the kitchen or your uncle nudges you during dinner, it seems everybody wants to know if they can make a quick buck off bitcoin. Hope springs eternal. As you settle in for the Thanksgiving weekend, you can welcome these inquiries because Quartz has you covered with an easy guide.

How’s bitcoin doing these days?

Tell your family: The market is bouncing back.

This year has been delightfully kind to bitcoin buyers, providing an 88% return year-to-date. If you bought one bitcoin on Jan. 1, 2019, your investment (of $3,750) would now be worth about $7,000.

Of course, that gamble would have peaked near $12,000 in August before tapering off rather dramatically. November, in particular, has been a tough month for the digital currency, with bitcoin falling to a six-month low.

Why the sudden drop in prices?

Tell your family: China is cracking down (again).

Some analysts have blamed the downturn on China, which—after briefly embracing blockchain—renewed its crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges. Since late 2017, the country has officially banned crypto trading, but a thriving underground economy remains for over-the-counter, or person-to-person, swaps. China has expressed opposition to mining, the energy-intensive process used to confirm transactions and earn new bitcoin. (There’s also a chance the country could issue a digital yuan, but that remains to be seen.)

Do you think bitcoin will bounce back?

Tell your family: Most likely.

Yes. In crypto, volatility is the name of the game. If I were a betting man, I’d say bitcoin may even reach $20,000 again. The most enthusiastic crypto watchers are waiting for May 2020, when bitcoin’s issuance rate—the speed at which new units enter circulation—is expected to drop sharply. Currently, mining bitcoin provides a “block reward” of 12.5 bitcoins ($90,000). Soon enough though, that reward will programmatically halve to 6.25 bitcoins, a process that will intermittently repeat.

Eventually, the reward will drop to 3.125 bitcoins around 2024 and then 1.5625 bitcoins sometime in 2028. (Note: This process will continue until 21 million bitcoins have been distributed. You can keep track of the “Halvening” with any of these trackers.) The 18 millionth bitcoin was mined in October and as issuance dwindles, some believe the price will spike again. Others say the halvening is already priced in. Just remember: bitcoin’s supply is finite—when the 21 millionth coin has been mined, that’s all there will ever be.

What’s going on with that Facebook coin?

Tell your family: It’s a mess…

So you’ve heard of Libra! It’s Facebook’s digital currency, which it announced in June. The truth is, Libra’s not really a cryptocurrency. Facebook just uses a bunch of fancy marketing language, but hey.

Nobody really knows if Facebook’s going to launch Libra—it’s been beset by delays, regulators hate it, and some of Facebook’s most prominent partners already quit the project. Last month, Facebook waved goodbye to Mastercard and Visa, among others. Although Facebook’s crypto strategy is on the rocks, it’s worth paying attention to WhatsApp Pay and the recently announced Facebook Pay. Whether or not Facebook goes “all-in” on crypto, the company’s trying to find a way into your wallet.

So, level with me—is bitcoin a good investment?

Tell your family: Nobody can determine bitcoin’s value. Ultimately investing in bitcoin is betting that somebody else will pay more for it in the future.

Buying bitcoin is like going to Las Vegas. Sure, you could double your money, but you could just as easily lose your shirt. Bitcoin is like the stock market on steroids and it’s even less regulated. Lots of crypto traders are still worried about market manipulation.

Ultimately, I can’t say whether bitcoin is a good or bad investment, but it’s an exciting one. Telling people you own $100 of bitcoin makes you part of the club—and it will probably make you question things about the financial system.

To me, that is the investment. Bitcoin is the ultimate teacher. It challenges preconceived ideas about money and helps a person realize that our institutions are surprisingly frail.

For me, $100 is just the right amount to feel a rush when bitcoin rises—and it’s upsetting (but not devastating) when it plummets. Personally, I think people should consider retirement investments before making a short-term gamble, but everyone wants to live a little. So, why not? Have fun and buy a lottery ticket.

Elliot’s mixer is likely to make tracking Bitcoin more difficult, much like popular BTC solution CoinJoin, which allows multiple users to shuffle coins with each other to hide their history.

Some analysts argue the nascent market has a long way to go before reaching maturity, as seen in traditional markets, where smoothed volatility and liquidity are important factors. While others imply scarcity inherent in its algorithm is the main factor for bitcoin’s perceived value, now and in the future.

A poll conducted by Alex Kruger, a macro cryptocurrency analyst, shows the majority of Crypto Twitter participants think bitcoin (BTC) will ‘eventually’ mature and settle into a wide price range, resembling the traditional commodities markets in real-terms.

To drive home what he meant, Kruger said “something that settles into a range in real terms still trends in nominal terms due to inflation, as most commodities do.”

But timing is always the question and BTC could be faraway from that level of maturity, where it ‘settles’ into a defined range as the budding market of cryptocurrency moves into its 10th year.

Willy Woo, a crypto on-chain analyst and trader, said the price of BTC still had some ways to go in discovering a price ceiling.

“Anything between a [market capitalization] of $10 trillion to $100 trillion is fair game,” Woo said.

BTC’s market capitalization, a measurement of total coins in circulation multiplied by its spot price, stands at $204.4 billion, down from its yearly peak of $233 billion witnessed June 27, according to information provided by Messari, a cryptocurrency data provider.

Kruger said volatility is likely due to the lack of total capital in the space right now. As the market cap increases, the impact to BTC by large market participants, aptly named “whales”, is likely to be less impactful in shifting price.

That is a sobering fact for retail investors as volatility tends to be the most attractive aspect to cryptocurrency trading.

For institutional investors, it would be a welcome change.

Nic Carter, Partner at Castle Island Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on public blockchains, said BTC resembles a commodity more than any other asset class, but also said that volatility isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

“The lack of a supply response to a demand shock all but ensures it is likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future,” Cater said.

BTC’s halving, an event where the reward for mining new blocks is halved, meaning miners receive 50 percent fewer BTC for verifying transactions, is set to trigger on May 14, 2020.

In macroeconomics, scarcity tends to be a fundamental driving force that increases the value of an asset, much the same way that diamonds, oil and gold functions based on the supply and demand from speculative investors.

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of BCB Group, a regulated financial services enterprise for digital assets, said Kruger’s second scenario, in which scarcity continues to drive prices higher is likely to remain a constant forever. He also said global cryptocurrency adoption was a long way from mainstream adoption but said the markets continue to march on, regardless of price.

“I can tell you with great confidence that global adoption at established brands is growing steadily and purposefully,” Landsberg-Sadie said.

How far along BTC’s market cycle is, is yet to be determined, but if traditional economics prove true, BTC could be highly valued in the very near future.",2019-11-28 08:00:00+00:00,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/new-law-banks-hold-and-sell-bitcoin/,"The planned fourth EU Money Laundering Directive stipulates that banks may hold and sell Bitcoin from 2020.

This would open up a new business segment for banks and represent new competition for already established cryptocurrency exchanges.

So far, the European Union has shown a negative attitude towards cryptocurrencies and associated digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ether or XRP with money laundering and terrorist financing. However, this view seems to be turning slowly but surely. A revision of the Fourth Money Laundering Directive provides a great relief for banks.

Banks may keep Bitcoin safe and offer it to their customers

The EU has launched a new bill on the fourth Money Laundering Directive, which is scheduled to enter into force in 2020. Until now, banking institutions were prohibited from offering virtual assets or storing them for their customers. The German Bundestag has taken this EU law as an opportunity and recently passed its own bill to implement it, which provides for corresponding simplifications. However, further approval is required before the law can enter into force.

In the new draft law, the requirement for separation, which still existed in the first version, was deleted. The separation requirement stated that the retention of Bitcoin and other digital assets must not originate from the same legal entity as other banking transactions. Accordingly, banks would have had to resort to external service providers who offer an appropriate custody service.

From next year, however, banks in Germany will be able to offer their customers cryptocurrencies in addition to traditional financial instruments such as shares or securities in online banking. Industry experts welcome this decision and attribute Germany a pioneering role in the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Sven Hildebrandt, head of the consulting firm DLC, states:

Germany is well on its way to crypto heaven. The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of crypto custodians.

The German Bankers Association (BdB) describes banks as having a wealth of experience in keeping client assets secure and with strong security and risk management. In addition, banks have always been monitored by the Financial Supervisory Authority and are under constant observation.

Critics fear that banks could aggressively advertise cryptocurrencies. Financial expert Niels Nauhauser explains:

Basically, banks sell a wide variety of financial products if the commission is right. If they are allowed to sell cryptocurrencies and store them for a fee, there is a risk that they will sell their customers assets with a total risk of loss without them knowing what they are getting into.

Economist Fabio de Masi continues to warn that the banks have already waited for this moment to enter this lucrative business. However, sufficient information on the subject of cryptocurrencies and an explanation of the resulting risks must not be lacking:

The banks are hot on profits from crypto transactions. But financial consumer protection must not be undermined.

Bitcoin on its way into the mainstream?

This step would promote the spread and acceptance of cryptocurrencies, although it would not increase their use in people’s everyday lives. Bitcoin could be made available to a larger customer base as a speculative instrument, thus competing with shares and securities.

Since 2013, Bitcoin has recorded a higher return than one of the most important stock indices in the world, the S&P500. Despite a strong performance, it remains to be seen what actual impact these developments will have on Bitcoin’s price and the development of the market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin recorded a price increase of 8.20% to USD 7,553.30 within the last 24 hours.

At least five local exchanges have halted operations or announced they will no longer serve domestic users this month, after regulators issued a series of warnings and notices as part of a cleanup of digital currency trading.

China is stepping up scrutiny of its massive cryptocurrency industry just weeks after President Xi Jinping ignited a market frenzy by declaring Beijing’s support for the blockchain technology that underpins the sector. But financial watchdogs including the Chinese central bank have in past weeks ordered cryptocurrency firms to shutter and warned investors to be wary of digital currencies, seeking to rein in a market prone to excesses. Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like service, suspended accounts operated by major exchange Binance Holdings Ltd. and blockchain platform Tron.

Taken together, the latest wave of shutdowns and restrictions represent the biggest cleanup of the sector since an initial Chinese clampdown in September 2017. Although exchanges that allow users to buy Bitcoin and Ether with fiat money were banned, trading had remained rampant in China through over-the-counter platforms or services that deal with cryptocurrency assets only.

Now, even those alternatives have succumbed to regulators, spooking investors. Bitcoin this week sank to its lowest level in six months at the end of its longest losing streak since at least 2010. The largest cryptocurrency recovered with a 6 percent rebound on Wednesday, but is still poised to post its worst month since November last year.

Twenty of the top 50 exchanges are based in the Asia-Pacific region and accounted for about 40 percent of bitcoin transactions in the first half of the year, according to data from Chainalysis. Within the region, the most exchanges are in China, the research firm found.

Aaron Hu, a 26-year-old computer engineer in the central Chinese city of Changsha, said he moved all the cryptocurrency he holds — several million yuan’s worth — from exchanges like Binance and OKEx to his own wallet address. “The first thing I thought of is how to secure my assets,” he said.

Last week, Chinese exchange operators Bitsoda and Akdex announced termination of service. Rival Biss said this month it had halted operations while executives cooperate with a government probe. Btuex said Monday it would shut in response to Chinese government orders, reopening in future to serve only overseas users. And Idax said on Sunday it would also no longer serve users in China but would focus on users abroad, citing policy reasons.

“It appears that, like everything else within their borders, China feels it needs to have tighter controls on the crypto market including exchanges, miners and asset issuers,” said Katie Talati, head of research at Arca, a Los Angeles-based asset manager that invests in cryptocurrencies. “I do believe, however, they are moving in a similar direction as Japan and other jurisdictions that have tight and clear regulations for crypto businesses.”

For now, uncertainty over how deep the apparent crackdown will run has spurred traders to transfer their money to safer places. Tether, a so-called stable coin pegged to the U.S. dollar, is a popular vehicle for investors to move their money into and out of cryptocurrencies.

One of cryptocurrency’s largest wallet apps, ImToken, said Tether transactions among its nearly 10 million users surged to $66 million on Nov. 22, the day China’s central bank issued its latest warning against cryptocurrency trading. That’s more than double the app’s average daily Tether transaction in October, the IDG-backed startup said.

“The current situation and environment for blockchain in China is still very positive,” Tron founder and cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun said. “In the short term, it may not get as much progress as we’d expect.”

Cryptocurrency is one of the top issues for the U.S. Treasury. Particularly, the Treasury is worried decentralized cryptocurrencies can shift some functions away from the government to the private sector and raise the issue of self-government, according to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Justin Muzinich.

Power Shift, Self-Government

Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Justin Muzinich discussed the Treasury’s priorities at the annual conference of the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) in New York last week. One area he focused on was payments, particularly cryptocurrencies. While acknowledging the value of innovation and welcoming efficiency improvements, he said:

Decentralized privately-issued digital currencies are not simply a means of payment, but, depending on their structure, can shift some functions traditionally performed by government to the private sector.

Muzinich added that “Digital currencies at scale raise not only concrete questions about money laundering, monetary policy, and other topics, but also very abstract questions about self-government.” The other topics he referred to included financial stability, user protection, and privacy. Due to these risks, the deputy secretary warned that those engaged in crypto markets should expect that “policymakers, in pursuing the public interest, will take a very hard look at these issues.”

While the Financial Stability Board (FSB) does not consider cryptocurrency a financial stability risk at this time, the Federal Reserve said stablecoins are a risk to the country’s financial system in a report issued earlier this month. The Fed believes that “the possibility for a stablecoin payment network to quickly achieve global scale introduces important challenges and risks related to financial stability, monetary policy, safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing, and consumer and investor protection.”

Crypto Makes Enforcing Laws Difficult

The deputy secretary also discussed crypto-related problems the Treasury faces under the existing regulatory framework. Talking about national security, he revealed that “One of the issues at the top of Treasury’s mind is that digital currencies can potentially be used to evade existing legal frameworks.” Some problem areas he mentioned were taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT).

“We recognize that there is no way to fully future-proof our regulatory system and tackling these policy challenges will require ongoing work,” Muzinich admitted. Emphasizing that the Treasury has made it clear that U.S. laws apply to both fiat and digital currencies, he noted:

If a cryptocurrency allowing anonymous transactions were to grow to scale, enforcing laws that prevent crime and terrorist financing could be more difficult.

Muzinich’s statement echoes several concerns raised by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. At a White House press briefing in July, Mnuchin said that the Treasury had “serious concerns” regarding the growing misuse of digital assets. “Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cybercrime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs, human trafficking. Many players have attempted to use cryptocurrencies to fund their malign behavior,” he told the press, adding:

This is indeed a national security issue.

Mnuchin also emphasized that crypto service providers must implement the same AML and CFT safeguards as traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, money transmitters must comply with relevant Bank Secrecy Act obligations and register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen), which recently reiterated that it will strictly enforce AML rules on crypto service providers. Fincen’s rules are similar to the recommendations by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental AML watchdog. At the FATF plenary meeting in June, Mnuchin said the U.S. “will allow for proper use, but we will not tolerate the continued use for illicit activities.” He additionally revealed that he had “convened a working group with the Federal Reserve and other regulators to make sure we keep the use of digital assets for legitimate use only.”

With Wall Street slowly taking charge of crypto, the days of radical outsiders launching successful altcoins may be numbered.

Many cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too.

Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course–the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realizing after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news.

Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin–“coin x is the new Bitcoin,” for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand–as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticize regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market–despite efforts such as Howey Coin by U.S. regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto.

Related Facebook’s Libra Might Fail Before it Launches

No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures:

1. Big Finance has arrived

Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionized money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and left-field entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralized units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control.

A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalizing trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products.

Related What to Expect as Cash Moves Out and Digital Currency Moves In

We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm–an ironic full turn of events, to say the least.

Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough.

2. The future is stable

For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralized cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built.

This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies.

Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to $1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favor large institutions–witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance.

3. Losses more foul than fair

Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or U.S. dollars with a Nevada-based outfit.

The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the $19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s Ponzi victims in 2008.

Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120 percent per year. After longstanding Ponzi accusations, the U.S. authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96 percent in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today.

Related Understanding Protocol Wars and What They Mean for Blockchain

An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt. Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked several times, costing investors tens of millions of dollars.

One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth $137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died.

We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue–and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world–and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.

That’s even before they’ve made a single satoshi in profit.

This resultantly means that purchasing cryptocurrency can be expensive for consumers — notably for those who might be seeking to convert their fiat by making a deposit using their credit card or bank account. Although the fees may seem relatively small, they do add up over time, especially for crypto enthusiasts who complete transactions on a regular basis.

That said, there is some good news for consumers on the horizon. Costs are beginning to fall as markets gain liquidity, and as the infrastructure for making fiat–crypto conversions becomes more prolific. The sheer number of exchanges out there also means there’s healthy competition for the business of consumers and traders alike, with platforms working overtime to offer the best rates in the industry.

Discounted crypto purchases

One crypto provider, Lumi Wallet, is seizing upon the Black Friday craze to offer discounted fees for a limited time only. From Nov. 28 to Dec. 1, consumers who use their credit card to purchase Bitcoin or Ether will receive 12.5% off. The company adds this deal will make it more affordable to purchase some crypto and save it for the future — or to buy something with it straight away. Other digital currencies such as Bitcoin Cash and EOS are also available, along with more than 1,200 ERC-20 tokens.

Lumi Wallet is available here

Once Lumi’s app is downloaded on an Android or iOS device, transactions can be completed immediately and conversions can be made from either U.S. dollars or euros. A web wallet is also available, along with a separate, gamer-focused service called Lumi Collect. This wallet enables users to store and manage their ERC-721 tokens — otherwise known as nonfungible tokens and crypto collectibles.

The company says its main goal is to blend high-level security, where private keys constantly remain under the client’s control and stored locally on their device, with a user-friendly experience that enables transactions to be finalized in a few easy clicks.

New features

Lumi also has bold plans to expand its services and offer new features to consumers. One of them is called Withdraw — and to begin with, it is going to be exclusively available for users who live in the European Union. It is described as a simple and quick offramp from crypto to fiat, enabling users to instantly cash out cryptocurrency from their wallet and get it transferred to their credit card. All of this is set to help consumers move their assets and manage their money much more effectively — giving them the type of freedom with their funds that has previously been difficult to find in the crypto industry.

The company gives regular updates about its product through a special blog. For example, it was recently announced that Lumi Wallet is now available in German — joining Japanese, Korean, Russian and English. This has been part of a concerted push to be internationally focused and to appeal to as diverse a range of crypto enthusiasts as possible.

In a tweet on Nov. 27, Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey said that he would return to Africa in 2020 after spending time traveling in Nigeria and Ghana this month.

Dorsey highlights Africa’s Bitcoin potential

“Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!),” he commented, revealing he planned to spend up to six months on the continent next year.

During his stint in Nigeria, Dorsey attended a Bitcoin meetup, continuing his personal advocacy of the cryptocurrency.

The tech mogul has become famous for his Bitcoin support, having pledged to integrate its functionality into both Twitter and Square. He has also publicly endorsed the Lightning Network as a payment solution, something which allows Bitcoin users to send funds instantly for next to no fee.

Government slow to respond

Dorsey’s comments come as Africa continues to generate significant interest in Bitcoin. As Cointelegraph reported, Nigeria regularly features among the most active countries in terms of Bitcoin Google searches, along with fellow African nations such as South Africa.

Lagos, Nigeria’s most populous city is tipped to become a giant metropolis of over 32 million people as soon as 2050, adding to its weight as a market for the cryptocurrency. According to data from the World Economic Forum, it will be the most populous city in the world by 2100.

In total, by the next century, 13 of the top 20 global cities by population will be in Africa.

Local government has so far taken a risk-averse stance on Bitcoin. This month, Ghana revealed it was considering a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, in line with plans from China.

US Attorney’s Office Arrests Virgil Griffith for Teaching Blockchain Technology to North Koreans

The U.S. Attorney SDNY and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced charges against Virgil Griffith on November 29 detailing that the American citizen violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Griffith is a well known member of the cryptocurrency community and worked with the Ethereum Foundation.

U.S. law enforcement agencies allege that Griffith traveled to North Korea (DPRK) and gave “a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.” “Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers said. “By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.”

Ostensibly Griffith also traveled to the DPRK to present at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference despite the Department of State denying him permission to travel to DPRK. “At no time did Griffith obtain permission from OFAC,” the SDNY press release stressed. U.S. citizens and businesses are not permitted to transact with persons and companies on the OFAC list. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list is a record of individuals and companies that are tied to targeted or sanctioned countries.

“At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, Griffith and other attendees discussed how the DPRK could use blockchain and cryptocurrency technology to launder money and evade sanctions,” the SDNY statement stressed. Griffith was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on November 28 and reportedly attended court the next day.

‘A Government Corrupt at the Core’

After the cryptocurrency community caught wind of the news about Griffith’s arrest many people were angered at the U.S. government’s actions. “Teaching about blockchain technology is illegal now in the Land of the Free,” remarked Shapeshift’s CEO Erik Voorhees on Twitter. Some people mentioned how Griffith openly tweeted about getting a Visa to DPRK and that the U.S. government took notice. “Virgil’s situation was avoidable to be sure — But this may be a sign of things to come,” Coin Metric’s founder Nic Carter opined. “Ultimately anyone writing code or creating resources for crypto can be alleged to be helping hostile jurisdictions avoid sanctions under this loose standard, whether or not they intend to,” he added.

The notorious U.S. presidential candidate John McAfee said that the American government was dishonest. “Virgil Griffith arrested for teaching North Korea how to avoid U.S. sanctions by using cryptocurrency and the Blockchain. See what our Government has become — A government corrupt at the core, declaring publicly available information a national secret,” McAfee exclaimed. Another person responded to McAfee’s statement and said: “Arrested for opposing the Wall Street/London Cartel.”

The 36-year old Griffith is a resident of Singapore and citizen of the United States and his charges carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison if convicted. “The charge in the Complaint is merely an accusation,” explain the law enforcement agencies handling the case which include Counterintelligence, Export Control Section, and the Southern District’s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced Friday that Griffith was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Thanksgiving Day.

“Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,” John Demers, an assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.

The complaint specifically cites violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The announcement said that Griffith should appear in a court in Los Angeles today.

In April, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, held the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. According to a complaint brought against Griffith, he sought approval to attend the conference which was denied. He then traveled to the conference without permission, allegedly by way of China.

The complaint against Griffith was authored by a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation named Brandon M. Cavanaugh. He notes that on May 22, 2019, the two participated in what Cavanaugh calls a “consensual interview.”

The complaint asserts, “At the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, GRIFFITH and other attendees discussed how blockchain and cryptocurrency technology could be used by the DPRK to launder money and evade sanctions, and how the DPRK could use these technologies to achieve independence from the global banking system.”

The affidavit does not name any specific cryptocurrency, only asserting Griffith had expertise in what it refers to as “cryptocurrency-1.” It alleges that “after the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, Griffith began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of Cryptocurrency-1 between DPRK and South Korea.”

As part of the interview, Griffith showed the agent photos and documents from the gathering and said he would like to return to the conference when it happens again in 2020.

According to his LinkedIn page, he has worked for the Ethereum Foundation since October 2016. As previously reported, he has served as its head of special projects. Subsequent to publication, the foundation sent a statement to CoinDesk that noted it is aware of and following the situation, writing:

""We can confirm that the Foundation was not represented in any capacity at the events outlined in the Justice Department’s filing, and that the Foundation neither approved nor supported any such travel, which was a personal matter.""

Griffith’s attorney was not immediately reachable.

The complaint alleges that Griffith was interested in seeking citizenship in another jurisdiction. His LinkedIn page currently shows him primarily residing in Singapore. Recently, he has been working to certify ethereum as compliant with Islamic law.

The case is being handled by the Southern District’s Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit, with assistance from the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.

Next year German banks will be able to manage cryptocurrencies like bitcoin after the fourth EU money laundering directive goes into effect. The directive passed in the German parliament, Bundestag, allows banks in the country to act as cryptocurrency custodians rather than rely on third-party custodial services.

German Banks Will Soon Be Able to Manage Cryptocurrencies

According to the regional financial news publication Handelsblatt, in 2020 banking institutions from Germany will be able to manage cryptocurrencies for customers. Under newly enacted legislation, banks in Germany will be able to receive, store, and sell digital assets like bitcoin cash (BCH) and ethereum (ETH). Directive 2015/849 is an amended regulatory approach that was issued by the European Parliament and German politicians. The fourth EU money laundering directive highlights the fact that “electronic money products is increasingly considered to be a substitute for bank accounts.” Handelsblatt reporter Felix Holtermann reveals that the new directive’s “deletion of the so-called separation bid” makes it so German banks can handle cryptocurrencies without needing to use a third-party custodian. Prior to erasing this part of the guidelines, the directive would have required banks to use “external custodians or special subsidiaries” to store the cryptocurrencies.

In 2020, German banks will be able to offer cryptocurrency solutions alongside bonds, equities, and traditional stocks. The banks will need to procure a license to offer digital asset custodial services, but the directive extends application deadlines. The consulting firm DLC’s executive Sven Hildebrandt believes the initiative puts Germany ahead of the game. “Germany is well on its way to becoming a crypto-heaven,” Hildebrandt remarked. “The German legislator is playing a pioneering role in the regulation of cryptocurrencies.” The cofounder of the crypto data aggregator website Coingecko, Bobby Ong, says that banks offering these types of services open financial institutions to a lot of opportunities. Ong explained on Friday:

Just like how banks sell gold, stocks, unit trusts, and insurance directly to retail consumers now, I see no reason why banks will not offer cryptocurrencies for sale now. What’s taking these bankers so long? It’s a big gold mine waiting to be tapped.

While Some Welcome the New Guidelines, Other Are More Critical of the Fourth EU Directive

Local reports underline that the German banking association Bundesverband deutscher Banken (BdB) “welcomed the new regulation.” “Credit institutions are experienced in the safekeeping of client assets and in risk management, are committed to investor protection and have always been controlled by the financial supervision,” the banking association said. BdB added that the new directive makes it possible for investors to invest in digital assets domestically rather than searching elsewhere for foreign funds. The CEO of Binance Changpeng Zhao (CZ) emphasized after the German bank crypto announcement that “smart banks do this” and “Bitcoin [is] still not dead.” Other critics don’t find the fourth EU money laundering directive so inviting and friendly. “With the new AML law, it affects the whole EU — combine this with negative interest rates for billions of euros which are sitting in their bank accounts — Next year everyone in the EU will get a bill for holding fiat in their bank accounts,” a skeptic wrote.

Another detractor against German banks holding cryptocurrencies is Baden-Wuerttemberg executive Niels Nauhauser. The financial analyst told the Handelsblatt that the new directives will add more strain to consumer protection advocates. “If [German banks] are allowed to sell cryptocurrencies and keep them for a fee, they run the risk of turning their assets at risk of a total loss to their clients, without them knowing what they are getting into.” Nauhauser also stressed that banks already have to inform customers about the costs and risks associated with investment vehicles like bonds and equities. The Baden-Wuerttemberg analyst underlined that direct sales of digital assets will need the same attention.

In a blog post on Nov. 29, IDAX, which earlier this week warned it was seeing a run on withdrawals, said the whereabouts of Lei Guorong were currently unknown.

IDAX: cold wallet access “restricted”

“Since we have announced the announcement on November 24, IDAX Global CEO have gone missing with unknown cause and IDAX Global staffs were out of touch with IDAX Global CEO,” it reads.

The blog post continues that as a precaution, the company’s cold wallet was on lockdown to protect user funds:

“For this reason, access to Cold wallet which is stored almost all cryptocurrency balances on IDAX has been restricted so in effect, deposit/withdrawal service cannot be provided.”

IDAX did not directly link Lei with cold wallet access, nor did it suggest that users’ money was specifically at risk.

Exchanges feel renewed pressure

The debacle follows a contentious period for cryptocurrency in China after authorities doubled down on the country’s 2017 trading ban last week. As Cointelegraph reported, a sweep saw the central bank vowing to “dispose of” any exchanges it found flouting the ban.

IDAX stopped serving Chinese users at the start of the week. Its predicament nonetheless provides yet another example of the pitfalls involved when trusting a third party to store cryptocurrency.

Earlier this week, South Korean exchange Upbit likewise halted users’ access to funds after a suspicious transaction saw more than $50 million leave its books at once.

While investors appear to be waking up to the risks, recent data shows that even institutional traders still overwhelmingly prefer trusting others with their funds.",,https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-remains-strong-as-160-million-stolen-from-crypto-exchanges-in-2019/,"Throughout the year, hackers have been able to infiltrate multiple crypto exchanges across the world taking with them millions of dollars worth of digital assets. Despite the massive losses recorded, Bitcoin was able to shrug off the “FUD” and continue its uptrend.

$160 million worth of cryptos stolen

New Zealand-based Cryptopia was the first cryptocurrency exchange to get hacked this year. The attack took place on Jan. 14 after the company announced an emergency “maintenance.” By Jan. 15, the exchange’s website went offline, including support and blog pages. On that day, Cryptopia announced that it had suffered a “security breach which resulted in significant losses.”

Elementus, a blockchain data analytics firm, estimated that $16 million worth of Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens were lost. Later on, the company reported that the hacker kept Cryptopia’s private keys and was able to withdraw an additional 1,675 ETH.

The month of March saw two cryptocurrency exchanges lose their funds. First, Singapore’s DragonEX reported via their official telegram channel that the exchange was compromised, and approximately $7 million worth of cryptos were transferred out of their wallets.

Then, South Korean-based exchange Bithumb released a statement stating that an “abnormal withdrawal” occurred at 13:00 UTC on March 29. The unauthorized withdraw resulted in the loss of $13 million worth of EOS. The firm took full responsibility for the funds lost as it suspected that the breach was an insider job.

Bithumb stated:

“All the [stolen] cryptocurrency is owned by the company, and all members’ assets are under the protection of a cold wallet.”

Along the same lines, Binance, the world’s largest crypto asset exchange in daily volume, experienced a security breach involving 7,000 BTC valued at around $40 million. Changpeng Zhao, the exchange’s CEO, said that the hack represented about 2 percent of Binance’s BTC holdings. And, reassured investors that all the funds would be covered by the exchange.

Zhao affirmed:

“Binance will use the #SAFU fund to cover this incident in full. No user funds will be affected. We must conduct a thorough security review. The security review will include all parts of our systems and data, which is large. We estimate this will take about ONE WEEK. We will post updates frequently as we progress.”

Moreover, Singapore-based Bitrue announced in a series of tweets on June 27 that a hacker exploited a vulnerability in their risk control protocol. The cybercriminal was able to access the personal funds of about 90 Bitrue users containing almost $5 million worth of cryptos.

A few weeks late, the Japanese exchange BITPoint lost $28 million in an attack that affected over 50,000 users. In a blog post, BITPoint’s CEO Genki Oda confirmed 1,225 BTC, 1,985 BCH, 11,169 ETH, and 5,108 LTC were stolen. Oda also promised to refund users their cryptos on a 1:1 basis.

Finally, the biggest crypto heist of the year took place earlier this week. UPbit, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges based in South Korea, reported that 342,000 ETH were transferred from the exchange’s hot wallet to an unknown wallet equivalent to $50 million.

Lee Seok-woo, the CEO of Dunamu, which is the firm behind UPbit, assured to cover all the losses with corporate assets. And, he ensured that deposits and withdrawals would resume in the next couple of weeks.

Bitcoin remains strong

Despite the attacks that some of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the industry experienced this year, the incidents were not able to affect Bitcoin’s bullish trend. The flagship cryptocurrency is up 120 percent since the beginning of the year and is signaling a further advance.

Several technical patterns are pointing out that this cryptocurrency could surge to $15,000. But, it remains to be seen if volume would picks up to support such a bullish impulse.",2019-11-29 18:54:55+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/photonics-bitcoin-mining-tech-aims-to-democratize-energy-use/,"Photonics Bitcoin Mining Tech Aims to 'Democratize' Energy Use

Three researchers have published a paper at Cornell University’s arxiv.org proposing a system called Optical Proof of Work (OPOW) to potentially be employed in Bitcoin mining. According to the paper, “heavy reliance on electricity has created scalability issues, environmental concerns, and systemic risks.” The authors state that silicon photonics could be used to shift mining costs away from energy-intensive to hardware-based costs, lowering the economic and environmental impact, adding greater security, and “democratizing” mining.

Optical Proof of Work

The system proposed by authors Michael Dubrovsky, Marshall Ball, and Bogdan Penkovsky is described as “a novel POW algorithm, Optical Proof of Work (OPOW), to eliminate energy as the primary cost of mining. Proposed algorithm imposes economic difficulty on the miners, however, the cost is concentrated in hardware (capital expense-CAPEX) rather than electricity (operating expenses-OPEX).” In other words, the paper’s proposal is that photonics could potentially enable much more energy efficient mining, which might have a number of effects on the industry.

The “Optical Proof of Work” paper states that “Rapid growth and improvement in silicon photonics over the last two decades has led to the commercialization of silicon photonic co-processors (integrated circuits that use photons instead of electrons to perform specialized computing tasks) for low-energy deep learning. OPOW is optimized for this technology such that miners are incentivized to use specialized, energy-efficient photonics for computation.”

Many questions remain as to the proposed implementation, however, centering on the economic realities of market competition and economies of scale, as well as changes at the algorithm level which would need to take place. Also, although the proposal is to make mining hardware much more specialized and difficult to acquire, unique from system to system (to disincentivize risks like 51% attacks), footnotes in the paper admit there could be exceptions. “Although not impossible, a coordinated effort to rent on the order of half of the hardware on a network would be difficult to hide and owners of hardware have an incentive not to rent to attackers, as the hardware is likely to lose value if the network is attacked.”

Dubrovsky’s Thoughts on the Proposal

Michael Dubrovsky, Co-Founder of Powx, and one of the three researchers behind the paper, shared some insights regarding the project with news.Bitcoin.com via email, detailing: “Our first live implementation will be with a partner network that will start using OPOW Q1- Q2 2020. We’re hoping to see broader adoption (eventually Bitcoin) after the first implementation proves the concept.” When asked about how photonics might affect competition in the industry, and whether large mining operations wouldn’t simply use their current energy capacity to power even more miners, he replied:

It’s a bit counterintuitive. The additional [hardware] miners will buy with their energy savings will add some marginal energy use but if the hardware is ultra-energy efficient, you still get a huge energy savings.

“There’s a section on this in the whitepaper but we go into it in more detail in our upcoming academic paper,” Dubrovsky elaborated. “We will release V1 in a few months. Heavyhash is not that complicated so it doesn’t require a massive library of code. We’ll also publish chip design files for our prototypes.”

The paper describes heavyhash as a custom hash function and states: “In its simplest form, OPOW is the Hashcash algorithm with our custom hash function, Heavyhash, designed specifically to run efficiently on optical accelerators while preserving all POW-necessary cryptographic security properties.”

Some commenters on Dobrovsky’s Twitter post on the subject voiced concern with a proposed changeover which, in the researcher’s words, would be a soft fork to the existing protocol. It’s clear that both protocol-level and economic doubts remain, including questions regarding the totally new field of competition that would presumably be created for the best photonic chip, hardware, etc. Whether or not mining could ever be democratized in the sense of helping “the little guy” remains to be seen, and only the future will tell if photonics can indeed bring about significant change in the bitcoin mining industry.

A report from Izvestia on Nov. 29 cites several sources allegedly familiar with ongoing discussions at the country’s central bank, financial regulator and Ministry of Finance in support of a ban.

Legal measures not yet officially confirmed

At present, cryptocurrencies can be used for e-commerce and many Russian freelancers, including programmers, designers and copywriters, agree to receive their salaries in Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), Vladislav Antonov told Izvestia.

Antonov, an analyst at Alpari Information and Analytical Center, noted that while they are not officially permitted, cryptocurrencies are often used to purchase a range of goods and services; including tickets, computers and household appliances, renting an apartment, or booking a hotel.

If Izvestia’s sources are correct, Russian regulators think a ban is necessary to prevent cryptocurrencies from being used as payment, citing their concerns about crime.

The report refers to comments from Alexey Yakovlev, deputy head of the banking regulation department of the Ministry of Finance, who reportedly reaffirmed at a recent conference on crypto-economics, “We do not see any basis for cryptocurrencies to be used as a means of payment.”

The press department of the central bank has not officially confirmed the drafting of a formal bill, but emphasized that private cryptocurrencies cannot be equated with fiat currency and cannot be considered a legitimate way to pay for purchases:

“If a decision is made to ban cryptocurrencies as a means of payment at the level of legislation, we consider it appropriate to support this position.”

Law will foster a “gray market”

The report claims that the Russian crypto community is readying itself for a potential tightening of restrictions, with rumors allegedly circulating that criminal penalties could carry terms of 5–8 years.

Due to the difficulties of enforcement, some industry representatives reportedly believe the ban will be limited to a series of “demonstration cases” intended to dissuade the public from flouting the law.

Antonina Levashenko, head of the Russia-OECD Center for RANEPA, has warned that the bill could foster the development of a gray market, outside of regulators’ oversight.

While the tradition originated in the U.S., it has since spread to all corners of the Earth and always takes place on the fourth Friday of November.

The event involves retailers across the country slashing prices on a variety of goods in a bid to kickstart the Christmas shopping season. Due to the multitude of discounts on offer, the day has become the busiest shopping day in the United States, with many stores opening at midnight and facing hordes of shoppers.

The term is believed to have originated in Philadelphia to describe the heavy road traffic experienced on the day but has since been co-opted to mean the day when retailers turn a profit and go from being “in the red” to “in the black.”

Crypto and Black Friday

Over the past few years, the tradition of Black Friday has found its way into the cryptocurrency industry, with several retailers and blockchain businesses putting on special discounts and accepting crypto payments.

One of the earliest crypto-related Black Friday events was Bitcoin Black Friday, which ran six successful events over seven years before recently coming to an end. Event organizer Jon Holmquist feels he has completed his “mission” with the event, but is open to someone else taking it over. However, many other crypto-related Black Friday events and specials continue as usual.

Major crypto hardware wallet suppliers Trezor and Ledger have historically held annual Black Friday specials, with the Ledger Nano S selling for half price last year. Several cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms have also run sales, with Coinigy offering a 75% discount on its annual package, Tradingview giving 60% off on its premium package, and CoinCorner offering £20 worth of Bitcoin to new customers.

Black Friday 2019

This year’s Black Friday event sees leading crypto exchange Binance doubling its referral reward to $30 for each new registration and Binance.US offering trading fee discounts of up to 75%.

Hardware wallet providers Trezor and Ledger are offering 30% discounts on certain products until Dec. 3, and Tradingview is again offering 60% off its premium subscriptions. All of the above accept payment in a variety of cryptocurrencies. Similar to last year, cryptos themselves appear to be on sale, with Bitcoin (BTC) and the majority of altcoins down 15–20% this week.

According to the November 29 announcement, the 36-year-old Griffith was arrested at the Los Angeles International Airport, and will be charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The charges carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman stated:

“As alleged, Virgil Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions. In allegedly doing so, Griffith jeopardized the sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place maximum pressure on North Korea’s dangerous regime.”

The IEEPA prohibits any U.S. citizens from exporting any goods, services, or technology to the DPRK without a license from the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control.

Griffith, a U.S. citizen living in Singapore, was previously denied permission to travel to the DPRK by the U.S. Department of State. Griffith went against the decision and presented at the DPRK Cryptocurrency Conference, violating the U.S. sanctions against the DPRK. FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. said:

“There are deliberate reasons sanctions have been levied on North Korea. The country and its leader pose a literal threat to our national security and that of our allies. Mr. Griffith allegedly traveled to North Korea without permission from the federal government, and with the knowledge of what he was doing was against the law. We cannot allow anyone to evade sanctions, because the consequences of North Korea obtaining funding, technology, and information to further its desire to build nuclear weapons put the world at risk. It’s even more egregious that a U.S. citizen allegedly chose to aid our adversary.”

North Korea trying to evade sanctions

North Korea is reportedly in the early stages of developing a cryptocurrency to help the DPRK evade international sanctions and find a way around “the U.S.-dominated global financial system.”

Alejandro Cao de Benos, the official in charge of North Korea’s crypto conferences, said at the time that the digital currency will be similar to Bitcoin (BTC) but that they are still in the very early stages in the creation of the token and that there are “no plans to digitize the [North Korean] won for now.”",,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/11/30/crypto-expert-charged-with-helping-north-korea-evade-us-sanctions,"Virgil Griffith has been arrested in Los Angeles and is alleged to have conspired to evade US-imposed sanctions.

The U.S. arrested an Ethereum Foundation cryptocurrency scientist and charged him with helping North Korea use blockchain technology “to evade sanctions and launder money.”

Virgil Griffith, 36, was arrested Thursday at Los Angeles International Airport and charged with conspiring to evade U.S. sanctions against the regime of dictator Kim Jong-un, according to a statement from Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman. Griffith, a U.S. citizen who lives in Singapore, attended a blockchain and cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang in April, despite specific State Department warnings.

“Griffith provided highly technical information to North Korea, knowing that this information could be used to help North Korea launder money and evade sanctions,” Berman said in a statement Friday. He “jeopardized the sanctions that both Congress and the president have enacted to place maximum pressure on North Korea’s dangerous regime.”

Griffith was the subject of a 2008 New York Times Magazine profile that described him as a “cult hacker” and dubbed him the “Internet Man of Mystery.” He worked with programmer and activist Aaron Swartz to develop Tor2web, which allows dark-web sites to be viewed on a standard internet browser. On his Linkedin profile, Griffith, a California Institute of Technology Ph.D., says he moved to Singapore in 2015 because he “concluded the best place for new growth” is Asia.

He has tweeted about North Korea a number of times in the past year. On June 29, he opined that emerging multinational standards on cryptocurrency regulations would create “a market opportunity” for the isolated regime to launch an exchange. In August, he tweeted a picture of his visa to visit North Korea.

Though the charges were filed in New York, Griffith is scheduled to first appear in federal court in Los Angeles sometime Friday.

Ethereum didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment on the charges against Griffith. His attorney, Galia Amram, didn’t immediately respond to phone and email messages.

The charges against Griffith don’t name Ethereum. According to the complaint, he is employed by “an entity that functions as an open-source platform for the development of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies,” including “Cryptocurrency-1.” Ethereum has a cryptocurrency it calls Ether.

If convicted, Griffith faces as long as 20 years in prison.

An ace in the hole for any argument against its proliferation. The go-to thesis for those who know very little about cryptocurrency but wish to appear otherwise.

The idea that cryptocurrencies are solely utilized within illicit activities has become both a tool for mass media to disparage the industry and, for many, a reason to steer well clear. But besides being a tired stereotype, it may also be true.

That’s one of the prevailing problems with stereotypes: While many derive from truth, they often represent an oversimplified — and sometimes twisted — version of it. It is true, for instance, that cryptocurrencies are used to facilitate criminal activities.

However, it is also true that any form of value will be used for illegal purposes, whether through crypto or fiat. That being said, digital coins account for just a fraction of the crimes funded with cash — which is also an undeniably more popular means of exchange.

Nevertheless, a lack of regulation and relative anonymity has granted cryptocurrencies infamy along with an air of immorality. In fact, several reports on cryptocurrency’s penchant for illegality have been published in the past two weeks alone.

XRP’s criminal undertow

On Nov. 20, cryptocurrency forensics and analysis firm Elliptic published an analysis on XRP transactions. Within their findings, the firm disclosed that $400 million worth of XRP had been used for “illicit activity.” This represents just 0.2% of total transactions, something which Elliptic suggests makes the vast majority of activity “legitimate.” Still, $400 million is no insignificant number. This is especially true for XRP, which was designed with institutional and commercial financial systems in mind.

Coincidentally, Elliptic’s reasoning behind exposing XRP’s clandestine transactions was to warn institutional clients before any potential entanglement. Dr. Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist of Elliptic explained the position to Cointelegraph:

“Any payments system, and especially open ones such as XRP, will be used for some level of illicit activity. What is critical is that this activity is identified, so that it can be mitigated.”

Robinson is of the opinion that by shining a light on such illicit activity, the company is helping the regulated financial institutions to engage with crypto assets such as XRP, adding that:

“They now have access to tools that allow them to identify whether they have received the tiny fraction of XRP funds that originate from illicit activity, and fulfill their AML obligations by reporting it.”

However, the firm declares that support for XRP is still in beta — a fact that could plausibly compromise the legitimacy of the findings.

Similarly calling the efficacy of Elliptic’s analysis into question was Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. Speaking to Cointelegraph, a Ripple spokesperson questioned the accuracy of data:

“Without more information or a clear methodology shared by Elliptic, it’s impossible to comment on the validity of this report.”

The Ripple representative also stated that the analysis could be little more than a publicity grab:

“We question the motive of this announcement, considering the report and its solution are not yet available, and these activities only account for 0.2% of XRP transactions — it seems like a PR stunt to leverage a better known name.”

As for Elliptic’s modus operandi, Robinson remained fairly tight-lipped, explaining the methodological basics while refraining from too much detail, although he did mention that a number of techniques are used: “We identify crypto-asset wallets that are associated with illicit activity, ranging from dark marketplaces to ponzi schemes or exchange hacks.” When pressed on the dangers of wrongly accusing an address, Robinson urged the efficacy of Elliptic’s methods:

“This is a risk that we are very conscious of, and which we address in a number of ways. For example we will only link a crypto address to an identified actor if we have clear proof of this attribution.”

PR stunt or not, in order to glean some accord on the reported figure, it’s crucial to get an idea of statistics concerning comparable tokens. With this in mind, Cointelegraph reached out to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis.

Maddie Kennedy, the director of communications for Chainalysis, remarked that while the firm’s own investigations into XRP are ongoing — and therefore, non-disclosable — analyses on other tokens revealed a fairly sizable chunk of criminality:

“We looked at 27 different cryptocurrencies and found that 0.4% of that transaction value is sent to an illicit entity. While that may seem like a small percent, that equals approximately $3.8B from January to October 2019.”

To clarify, that’s 0.4% of the total transaction value of 27 different cryptocurrencies. Given that 0.2% of total XRP transactions were presumed to be for illicit purposes, Eplipic’s findings are reasonably significant.

However, these figures are overshadowed by the ones the company found when conducting a similar study on Bitcoin. It suggests that dark web purchases currently account for approximately 0.5% of all BTC transactions. Robinson expanded on why he believes this figure is higher for Bitcoin than it is XRP.

“XRP is not as liquid as BTC, XRP is more centralised than other crypto-assets, and perhaps more associated with traditional finance — this might make it less attractive to illicit actors, who might prefer something more decentralised and ‘neutral,’ such as bitcoin.”

Rotting from the inside out?

While the nefarious use of crypto is still prevailing to some extent, crime within the industry seems to be boldly flourishing. According to a recent report from blockchain forensics firm CipherTrace crypto crimes have increased by 150% over the last year. Digital asset theft and fraud now total $4.4 billion, almost tripling the $1.7 billion witnessed in 2017.

Large-scale robberies are the main reason behind such a year-on-year rise, with alleged Ponzi schemes such as PlusToken claiming the lion’s share. Billing itself as a high-yield investment program, PlusToken is the latest project being discussed as an exit scam, with the report stating that it has appropriated $2.9 billion from its investors/victims.

Another high profile fraud case cited by Ciphertrace was that of the QuadrigaCX, a Canadian-based crypto exchange. A scandal involving the mysterious — and highly contested — death of the exchange’s CEO, and a misplaced mater key. All of this amounted to a loss of $190 million in cryptocurrency.

And that only scratches the surface. According to the report, many more crypto crimes aren’t even getting air time due to their relatively insignificant size compared to bigger heists.

The latest incident took place on Nov. 27, Lee Sirgoo — the CEO of crypto exchange Upbit — confirmed a theft had taken place on the platform. Hackers allegedly succeeded in compromising the exchange’s hot wallet, gaining access to, and absconding with, 342,000 Ether ($51 million) in user funds.

Putting it all in context

Intriguingly, even amid the rising prevalence of crypto crime, the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit activities appears to be dwindling. Back in 2017, a study by the University of Oxford found that an extensive 44% of all BTC transactions were felonious in nature, associated with financing criminal activity. In contrast, in July 2019, a Chainalysis report suggested that less than 1% of Bitcoin activity involved crime.

Yet, the stigma still persists. Detractors often drum up conjecture using the (mostly baseless) argument of cryptocurrency’s more nefarious use cases. Ironically, many of these provocateurs are proponents of fiat money, the stock market, or even gold — markets that hold their own wicked transgressions.

So, while it can unquestionably be argued that there is some criminal undergrowth within crypto, what about fiat? Earlier this year, U.S. Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, slammed cryptocurrencies for their part in funding illicit activity.

A briefing on the regulation of crypto observed a hyperbolic reaction from Mnuchin, who advised that digital currencies were a threat to national security, saying “Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity.” However, while attempting to cement the stigma around crypto criminality, Mnuchin failed to provide any clear context.

Luckily, providing a distinct frame of reference was Bitcoin research firm Messari. Following Mnuchin’s damning appraisal of crypto, researchers undertook plotting BTC expenditure on the darknet against dollars laundered.

Employing data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as well as Chainalysis, researchers revealed that U.S. fiat was used an incredible 800 times more often to launder money than Bitcoin was to fund dark net activities.

In the end, crypto — just like any other value-based asset — will continue to be used for illicit purposes. The best that can be done is to actively track, monitor and blacklist illegal transactions to ensure they don’t slip by unnoticed. Ironically, that’s much easier to do with crypto than it is with cash.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/459-days-until-btc-hits-its-longest-streak-without-a-new-all-time-high/,"459 Days Until BTC Hits Its Longest Streak Without a New All-Time High

Since bitcoin hit its all-time high (ATH) in December 2017, crypto enthusiasts have wondered if BTC will touch or surpass it again. After the ATH in November 2013 at $1,156 per BTC, it took 1,170 days to touch the next ATH at $19,891 per coin. To many observers, the downtime has been very long after the rough crypto winter of 2018, but so far it’s only been 711 days since the last price high.

BTC Traders Patiently Wait for the Next Bull Run

Digital currency and BTC prices rebounded after the fall in 2018 but not everyone is convinced the bearish sentiment is over. Optimism exists because on December 7 at approximately 8:05 EST, BTC prices dropped to a low of $3,306 per coin but since then BTC has regained at least half of the percentage losses. Positivity jumped back in the summer when BTC rose 320% from the December 2018 low to a high of $13,311 on June 27. But after that, expectations dropped when BTC prices slid to the $7K region during the last week of October. The dip made people wonder if the crypto winter was still alive and well. However, on October 24 BTC prices popped again from a low of $7,446 to a high of $10,021 on October 26. Since then BTC prices have been dragging low again and 27 days later the value dropped under $7K to a low of $6,400.

BTC has gained 5-7% in the last seven days and most digital asset markets seem to be in a recovery phase after the drops in value. One way to figure out how much longer it will be until the next ATH is by measuring how long it’s been since the last BTC price high. Historical data shows that between November 30, 2013 when BTC surpassed $1,100 per coin it took 1,170 days to surpass the 2013 ATH on February 13, 2017. Various factors drove the price up in 2013 like Mt Gox bots, the Cyprus banking crisis, and Chinese demand. Similarly, feverish retail demand, excitement for regulated BTC futures, economic hardships in Greece and Venezuela, South Korean demand, and the initial coin offering (ICO) boom helped fortify the 2017 ATH. When the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) initiated its BTC futures markets and CME Group (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) followed with its BTC derivatives products, spot markets were on fire. From February 13 to December 17, 2017, BTC jumped 1,629% to its current ATH of $19,891 per coin.

711 Days Since the December 17 All-Time High

Another set of factors helped the price slide after touching near $20K per BTC. Crypto enthusiasts witnessed the regulatory crackdown in South Korea, heightened regulatory guidelines in the U.S., EU and other regions worldwide, and the ICO market got slammed with regulations and criminal enforcement. Still, there are 459 days left if we look at the days between the 2013 ATH to when it touched again in 2017. So far there’s only been 711 days between the ATH of $19,891 per BTC. Since the network launch on January 3, 2009 up until November 30, there’s been approximately 3,983 days between.

Data also shows that BTC has been on the up roughly 3,573 days of its existence which turns out to be 89% of its life cycle. During the downtimes, however, crypto enthusiasts grow very impatient and this is quite prevalent on social media and forums at the end of 2019. Investing in cryptos is really not good for health, years of bear markets followed by a few days of bull run hysteria — And FUD all along,” one person remarked on Twitter this week. “707 days of bear market — I think we need a break please,” another crypto proponent said on Sunday. On November 25 after BTC prices were drifting downward another trader on Twitter stated:

In terms of [percentages], we’re almost exactly where we were this many days after the bottom in 2014. The explosion out of the bear market was too quick and too irrational. This prolonged correction is normal. Markets never repeat, but they rhyme. This is just the 3rd verse.

The wait has been long and many people believe that being patient will reap the most rewards as the overall value of cryptocurrencies, in general, is headed northbound. As news.Bitcoin.com’s Graham Smith reported on November 24, data shows that despite the market turbulence, BTC’s support lines remain intact. Just as no one was certain when the bear market would end after the 2013 ATH, this time around enthusiasts and traders are still guessing wildly. Analysts can log trendlines and trace historical patterns and we can measure days between ATHs as well, but we are mostly dependent on guesstimates and faith.

Dorsey’s tweet follows his tour of Africa—and it’s clear he liked what he saw. Dorsey, who’s previously come out in favor of Bitcoin, sees the continent as being key in the further development of cryptocurrencies.

Other crypto heads share his view. Nate Hindman, head of growth at on-chain liquidity protocol Bancor, is confident of crypto’s future in Africa. “In emerging markets like Africa, the shallow reach of traditional money systems means there’s less resistance to new financial technology,” he told Decrypt. And crypto companies have been busy in Africa—perhaps Dorsey’s onto something, after all. Here’s what’s been going on in Africa’s crypto-world.

Take a step back

“Africa is not “getting big into” bitcoin—they have been using bitcoin for years and taught us everything we know about what bitcoin’s true use cases are,” Ray Youssef, CEO of peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace Paxful, told Decrypt. “Africans have had peer-to-peer financial systems in place for thousands of years. In Nigeria, they call them ‘Esusu’, Kenya has ‘Chama’, while South Africa has ‘Stokvel’.”

But restrictive crypto laws in African countries can make trading on exchanges difficult. Youssef told Decrypt that Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, has restrictions in sending money outside the country, and that the lack of bitcoin liquidity was the first obstacle it had to solve to introduce bitcoin to Africa.

“We found a way for them to export an asset, which is gift cards, as a way to go around financial restrictions. Now, bitcoin is flooding out of Nigeria and into other African countries because of the ambition of the Nigerian bitcoin community and Paxful,” he said.

Paxful has enjoyed plenty of success in Africa. The service has over three million subscriptions—45% of which are from Africa—and it’s growing rapidly. In fact, the USA, Nigeria, and Ghana has reached 15 million trades over the past year, marking a 65% increase from last year.

Major exchanges are expanding into Africa, too. Just last year, Binance launched Binance Uganda, a fiat cryptocurrency exchange which allows for the direct conversion of Ugandan Shillings into Bitcoin. The program provides the country access to cryptocurrency trading, adding liquidity to the market and building the next generation of crypto traders in Africa. Other exchanges also focus on the region, such as Belfrics, which offers services in Kenya, Nigeria, and Tanzania.

Crypto for charity

In addition to its cryptocurrency exchange in Uganda, Binance’s philanthropic wing is operating a program called Lunch for Children, which uses donated cryptocurrencies to buy lunch for kiddos—specifically, the donated crypto is redeemed to pay suppliers for food.

Other crypto companies are also getting involved in charitable endeavours. In Mombasa, Kenya, the Bancor Foundation funded a Kenyan charity with digital tokens for bargaining in one of the city’s slums. The cryptocurrency, dubbed “Bangla-pesa”, was used to ease the community's credit issues—as a result, a more local cryptocurrency was useful to help alleviate poverty in the slum.

National digital currencies

Bitcoin isn’t the only player in Africa, of course. Like many other countries, African nations are exploring the potential of national digital currencies. Just this week, the governor of Ghana’s central bank, Ernest Addison, said that the country could issue a digital version of its currency, the cedi, in the ""near future”, and was, “in discussion with key stakeholders to explore a pilot project (in a sandbox environment) on central bank digital currency.”

In July this year, the South African Reserve Bank put out its own call for solutions providers to work on a pilot for a central bank digital currency, “to investigate the feasibility, desirability and appropriateness of central bank issued digital currency to be used as electronic legal tender, complimentary to cash.”

And the Tunisian Central Bank has ""examined"" the possibility of implementing its own cryptocurrency. It’s been coy about its own digital currency, and criticized what it termed “groundless allegations”. Considering the criticism by the US treasury directed at Venezuela’s Petro cryptocurrency, it’s easy to see why the Tunisian government is being careful. However, the Bank did acknowledge that at Forex Club, “participants at this event attended a technical feasibility demonstration of a theoretical digital currency solution.”",2019-11-30 14:45:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/canadian-regulator-green-lights-bitcoin-fund-ipo/,"Canadian Regulator Green-Lights Bitcoin Fund IPO

The Bitcoin Fund’s initial public offering (IPO) filing has been accepted by Canada’s Ontario Securities Commission. Despite previously rejecting it, the Canadian regulator finally accepted the fund’s IPO prospectus after a public hearing and a favorable ruling.

The Bitcoin Fund IPO

Crypto-focused Canadian investment fund manager 3IQ Corp. announced on Thursday that it has filed a preliminary prospectus for the IPO of The Bitcoin Fund. More importantly, the prospectus dated Nov. 27 has been receipted by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) after previously rejecting it. The IPO will offer two classes of units at $10 each.

The Bitcoin Fund is a closed-end investment fund established as a trust under Ontario’s laws, the company explained, adding that “the units will be an eligible qualified investment for registered investment accounts.” The fund’s investment objectives are to provide investors with long-term capital appreciation and exposure to bitcoin and its daily price movement in USD, the announcement details.

Founded in 2012, 3IQ already manages two other private digital asset funds for accredited investors in Canada. It will act as The Bitcoin Fund’s investment and portfolio manager. The crypto-focused company has been working to bring a public bitcoin fund to market for Canadian retail investors since 2016.

Success After a Long Battle

3IQ Corp. originally filed a preliminary prospectus for the IPO of The Bitcoin Fund with the OSC’s Investment Funds & Structures Projects branch (IFSP) in October last year. However, the staff raised a number of concerns after reviewing it, arguing that the fund was not in the public interest of Canadians. This resulted in the IFSP director rejecting the fund’s prospectus in February. The company then requested a hearing and a review of this decision. After a public hearing and several meetings, OSC Commissioner Lawrence P. Haber ruled that the staff’s concerns “do not warrant denying a receipt for The Bitcoin Fund’s prospectus.”

The commissioner believes that it is not the role of securities regulators to approve or disapprove of the merits of the underlying investment being offered to the public — bitcoin in this case. Among other bullish statements, he said, “there is sufficient evidence of real volume and real trading in bitcoin on registered exchanges in large dollar size.” After addressing each point of concern raised by the staff, the commissioner ordered the IFSP director to issue a receipt for the fund’s prospectus unless new evidence was found to warrant a rejection. Several weeks later, the company announced that the regulator has finally issued a receipt for the fund’s prospectus.

Nonetheless, the staff noted that “there are remaining steps for completion before a final offering prospectus can be receipted.” Particularly, Commissioner Haber’s order reveals that the final prospectus would include additional information regarding the offering such as pricing information and details regarding underwriters. The order further states:

3IQ also confirmed that it does intend to offer units of the fund to Canadian retail investors in all provinces and territories of Canada.

The company has clarified that the preliminary prospectus is subject to completion or amendment, and the sale will commence after the regulator has issued a receipt for the final prospectus.

On November 26, a new Silk Road video was published that reveals underreported and never-before-seen information. The film called the “Silk Road Case: The Real, Untold Story” contains over 400 references to direct evidence from a wide range of sources. The organization Freeross.org published the video on Youtube and called it “the most comprehensive, researched narrative about Silk Road and Ross Ulbricht’s case.”

New Silk Road Documentary Discusses How Ross Ulbricht Handed the Reins Over to Another Individual

Since the Silk Road marketplace was seized and Ross Ulbricht incarcerated, many facets of the case have remained a mystery to this day. The video published on Youtube on November 26 by the nonprofit organization Freeross.org tries to unravel some of the riddles behind the Silk Road investigation. “Silk Road Case: The Real, Untold Story” contains information that has never been publicly released before as well as underreported information from sources derived from various subjects, court filings, transcripts, trial exhibits, and affidavits.

When Ross started the Silk Road, he called it a “free-market economic experiment” and he wholeheartedly believed “people should have the right to buy and sell whatever they wanted, so long as they weren’t hurting anyone else.” Just a few months after the market launch, the news outlet gawker.com published an article about the Silk Road, which went viral and eventually reached the ears of politicians and law enforcement. New York Senator Chuck Schumer called for immediate action against the Silk Road marketplace and at the time, it was called the ‘Schumer’s case.’

Because Ross lacked the technical knowledge and programming abilities to run a marketplace as large as the Silk Road, he started asking friends for help. A close friend didn’t want anything to do with the market, so Ross turned to an anonymous individual. “A stranger provided the needed help and eventually took control of the site entirely,” the video’s narrator highlights. Moreover, the unknown Silk Road leader did an interview with the press shortly after Ross handed the market over. “I was in his corner from early on and eventually it made sense for me to take the reins,” the new DPR explained during his interview. In November 2011 following the transition, Ross told his close friend in an online chat room:

Glad that’s not my problem anymore.

Most people are unaware that after Ross gave up the reins, the new unknown leader of the Silk Road announced his infamous screen name on February 6, 2012. The newly appointed administrator told the public his name was the “Dread Pirate Roberts” (DPR) from the film “The Princess Bride.” Similarly to the movie script, DPR passed his name down to each successor and with the Silk Road, it’s still unknown how many DPRs existed.

Magical Tux, Rogue Agents, and How the Justice System Failed Miserably

After detailing that there were other players who filled the DPR role, the recently published video also discussed how the former Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles was a top suspect in the Silk Road case. Lots of the film’s narration stems from public information sources and explains how Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan thought that Mark Karpeles was involved with the market operations.

Der-Yeghiayan discovered a website on the clearnet called silkroadmarket.org that taught people how to use the market. According to Der-Yeghiayan’s investigation, its URL was registered with XTA.net. Then subpoenas revealed that XTA.net was owned by Mark Karpeles’ firm Mutum Sigillum. Der-Yeghiayan stated that Karpeles operated “hundreds of websites,” which “[made him] well-suited to operating a site such as the Silk Road.” The HSI agent’s reports also found that Karpeles used similar software to program his websites. In April 2012, Der-Yeghiayan believed that Karpeles and one of his associates, Ashley Barr, operated the Silk Road and controlled the DPR handle.

The comprehensive film also explains how another federal agent took control of the Silk Road case and took all of Der-Yeghiayan’s evidence. The video details how the same federal agent “leaked investigation details to two Baltimore agents” who eventually went rogue. DEA agent Carl Mark Force and Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges were later found guilty for manipulating the case and stealing millions of dollars worth of bitcoins. The two-hour film contains a lot of information from the server takedown, the setup and arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the deletion of evidence during the investigation and how the entire case was an abomination of justice.

Crypto exchange Sideshift’s SLP token, SAI, has scored remarkable gains in value this week. Its price jumped well over 30% on Thursday, from $0.0310 per coin early on Nov. 28 to over $0.0450 a few hours later, and to a record high of 0.0473 on Friday, Nov. 29.

SAI Maintains New Higher Price Range

SAI is the native token of Sideshift AI, an automated coin swapping platform that allows users to quickly exchange around two dozen cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin core (BTC) and several stablecoins. Of course, it supports SAI as well, which exists as a Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) token, an ERC-20 token and on the Liquid inter-exchange settlement network. It has a limited supply and only 210 million SAI will ever be minted.

The token is currently used to pay out rewards that can be earned by becoming a Sideshift affiliate. The exchange plans to increase its implementation in interactions with its services and other vendors. That includes rewards for takers of exchange orders, rebates when using SAI to pay fees, discounts for SAI merchant payments, paying employees, contractors, service providers, and partners in SAI. In the future, the crypto may be used to “buy-and-burn” Sideshift AI profits, offer trade incentives, and create merchant discounts, the platform’s website details.

For the better part of the past 10 days, SAI’s price stayed in the range between a low of $0.0272 and a high of $0.0346, data provided by markets.Bitcoin.com shows. A significant upward movement began on Thursday, Nov. 28, when the price jumped from around $0.0308 to a record high of 0.0473 the following day, an increase of close to 35% for a little over 24 hours. Following a modest correction, the token is trading at around $0.0464 at the time of writing, preserving most of its price gains. Currently SAI has a market cap of over $568,000 and a 24-hour volume of $4.45 million.

Exchange Listings and SAI’s Utility Increase Its Value

SAI is currently trading at three cryptocurrency exchanges – Sideshift AI, Coinex, and the Bitcoin.com Exchange. A major factor for the token’s price increase may have been the recent announcement of its upcoming listing on a fourth platform. Last Sunday, Nov. 24, Cryptophyl revealed it will be listing SAI in the first days of next month. The exchange also plans to airdrop 50,000 SAI tokens to holders of its own token, DROP. Users who have the coin in their wallets are eligible to receive token airdrops. The SAI-BCH market will go live at 09:00 UTC, Dec. 3, the announcement detailed.

Andreas Brekken, the developer who launched Sideshift, told news.Bitcoin.com that the platform is excited to have its SAI token as one of the first SLP tokens listed on the Bitcoin.com Exchange. While price discovery is an efficient process, he noted, it can take time for market participants to research tokens and to have that reflected in the market. Commenting on SAI’s recent price spike, he further elaborated:

The price increase of SAI is a result of buying pressure, likely from buyers having had time to research the utility of SAI and the promises of an automated coin swap service that doesn’t require users to register an account to perform trades.

SLP tokens based on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have been growing in number and approximately 5,000 have been created so far. They are issued by various projects and designed with a myriad of uses in mind. As news.Bitcoin.com reported in October, transactions using the SLP framework have increased significantly during the course of this year as well. The whole ecosystem has been expanding and besides many options to buy SLP tokens, you can also freely trade and safely store them.

Bitcoin.com has been an active supporter of the adoption of the Simple Ledger Protocol, a system allowing anyone to create tokens based on the BCH network in a permissionless manner. One of the main reasons for the launch of Exchange.Bitcoin.com was to provide SLP projects with a platform to list their various SLP tokens. An example of joint efforts in that direction is the integration of Sideshift, the issuer of the SAI token, with the Bitcoin.com wallet, which allows you to swap BTC and BCH within your mobile wallet app.

The levers are there to move hundreds of millions in crypto markets, and they’re clearly labeled

On May 17 of this year, bitcoin’s price dropped suddenly. The action started on a single exchange: Bitstamp, domiciled in Luxembourg, where the dollar price of bitcoin suddenly dropped more than 18 percent in a matter of minutes. The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a composite of several market feeds, recorded a 6 percent drop as a result.

Bitstamp was, at the time, one of three spot markets used as equal components in the bitcoin price index for BitMEX, a crypto derivatives exchange domiciled in the Seychelles that operates one of the most liquid bitcoin derivatives markets, the XBT/USD perpetual swap. BitMEX’s other two bitcoin index components are Coinbase Pro and Kraken. Of the three, BitStamp’s reported volumes are lowest.

The BitStamp price drop wasn’t random. It was caused by a large bitcoin sell order, placed well below the market. The resulting downward pressure triggered auto-liquidations of long positions in the hundreds of millions of dollars on BitMEX. Traders with short positions on the exchange stood to benefit.

In this column, I’ll provide a visual blow-by-blow of what happened May 17 on BitStamp, and a risk/return estimate: if it was manipulation, how much it cost, and how much the manipulators earned. I’ll conclude with thoughts on the liquidity imbalance that caused it, and how it might happen again.

Before getting into that, I’ll explain briefly how novel structures and thin markets could make such manipulation possible.

Novel market structures

In crypto markets, it’s normal for investors to interact directly with the exchange – an ethos derived from bitcoin, which invites its users to transact pseudonymously, without intermediaries. On derivatives exchanges, accommodating this requires a rethinking of market structure.

On traditional derivatives exchanges, brokers and clearinghouses manage the risk that a large price move will bankrupt one side of a trade. All participants have an incentive to make good at settlement, so they can trade again tomorrow. On the largest crypto derivatives exchanges, it is possible to trade directly under one account today and another tomorrow. This unfettered access and pseudonymity is part of the story of these exchanges’ rise to become the most liquid markets in crypto.

To cover settlement risk, BitMEX and other large crypto derivatives exchange operators use auto-liquidiation. For example, if the index price drops far enough below an open long position, the exchange automatically liquidates that position, to settle the trade. Excess proceeds from auto-liquidations are stored in an insurance fund. If auto-liquidation falls short of settlement, the insurance fund kicks in. If the insurance fund’s earmark falls short, auto-deleveraging occurs, unwinding both sides of the trade.

Thin markets

Liquidity is a subjective term, meaning an investor’s ability to move a reasonable volume of an asset, without an undue price shift. It is related to market depth, measured by the worst price an order will hit at a certain size limit.

In crypto, market depth is fragmented among dozens of the largest exchanges, and hundreds more in the long tail. Even in crypto’s blue-chip assets, bitcoin and ether, pools of liquidity are scattered, which makes them more shallow. This situation may be worsening. Bitcoin’s bid-ask spreads have widened on most of the largest exchanges in 2019, indicating decreasing market depth according to one tracker of composite data.

Exchanges that are part of price discovery infrastructure are thin enough that a large-ish order will move the price. And, as we will see below, derivatives markets can be far more liquid than the spot exchanges that help determine the price of their underlying assets.

What happened May 17

The chart above presents a second-by-second account of what happened on the Bitstamp BTC/USD spot market in the early morning hours of May 17, UTC. Each point on the chart is the minimum, or best, ask price offered in each minute’s snapshot of orderbook data, which is provided by CoinRoutes. The size of the point indicates the quantity of the order.

The action began at 3am UTC, with a sell order roughly 6 percent below the market price and hundreds of times larger than the norm on the exchange at that time. As that order fulfilled available bids, the ask price moved lower, dragging the market price down until it reached $6,276, at which point the selling stopped. A chronological calculation shows the sellers sold about 2,905.7 units of bitcoin, in aggregate at about $2.5 million below what they would have realized at a bitcoin market price of $7,700. At the same time, over $200 million in long positions were being liquidated on BitMEX, according to skew.com. If it was manipulation, it returned up to an 80X multiple over what the manipulators put at risk. The whole thing was over in about 10 minutes.

Update: Trader and Crypto Twitter denizen Mike Komaransky pointed out that while the potential return of the May 17 flash crash’s impact on the derivatives market was about 80X the capital apparently deployed into the underlying spot market, the profit to any manipulators involved in the crash would be more likely on the order of a 2X multiple, depending on their willingness to lever up on BitMEX. I’ve left my not-very-thorough math as is, above, and add Komaransky’s math, below.

Conclusions

Bitcoin’s network security model is a fairly straightforward bit of rational choice theory: miners are rewarded for recording new transactions. To earn the reward, they must prove they have committed something of value, i.e., energy. If a miner attempts to manipulate the transaction record, other miners will likely reject the contribution, invalidating the reward. The cost of manipulation and the likelihood of failure is balanced against the reward for expected behavior.

Bitcoin programmatically maintains that balance, without recourse to identity verification or trusted third parties. However, the market structure that has evolved around bitcoin has so far failed to achieve a similar equilibrium.",2019-11-30 09:10:00+00:00

Futures gap incoming if lower levels stay

Data from Coin360 showed the largest cryptocurrency shedding almost 30% of its gains from earlier in the week, dropping from local highs of $7,790 to around $7,300 at press time.

The downside equated to 24-hour losses of 6% for Bitcoin, which began showing signs it would test support strength at $7,000.

Previously, BTC/USD hit multi-month lows of $6,500 before rebounding almost $1,300 within a matter of days.

At press-time levels, the pair was trading at exactly the same level as last Sunday.

Now, analysts were looking for factors that could influence short-term momentum up or down. In particular, Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe eyed a likely “gap” in Bitcoin futures markets.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin price tends to “fill” points in its price which fall between where one futures trading session ends and another begins.

After Sunday’s drop, a new gap will likely have opened up, van de Poppe said, as CME’s contracts finished Friday trading at $7,805. This would thus propel BTC/USD back towards $8,000. Last week, a gap at $7,200 was likewise swiftly filled.

“Good part of this drop; another CME gap is created to the upside,” van de Poppe commented in a fresh Twitter update.

Continuing, he added the potential for Bitcoin likely lay between $6,900 and $8,000:

“I'd be interested to see whether we can break $7,400 up here. If we can, then we might be able to go to $8,000 after all. If not, I'm aiming at $6,900-7,000 for some longs.”

Futures analysis delivered mixed results this week after CME’s monthly contracts settled on Friday. Data suggested that Bitcoin would likely gain following the payouts, but so far, an opposing price trajectory has characterized markets.

Overall sentiment among futures traders nonetheless remains bullish, with competitor Bakkt seeing record daily volumes for its own monthly contracts last week.

Altcoins lose ground to BTC

Altcoin markets meanwhile saw a disappointing 24 hours, with many major cryptocurrencies shedding around 5%.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 4.2% to $147, while others fared worse. Litecoin (LTC), for example, was down 6.1%.

Top Stories This Week

Another week, another hack — leaving us all with a distinct sense of déjà vu. On Wednesday, the major South Korean crypto exchange Upbit confirmed that a whopping 342,000 Ether (ETH) had been stolen from its hot wallet — funds worth an estimated $50 million at the time of writing. The company stopped short of describing the incident as a hack and said that all remaining crypto assets have since been moved into cold storage. Deposits and withdrawals are going to be suspended for at least two weeks, and Upbit said corporate funds will be used to protect user assets. In recent days, rumors have been swirling that the incident could have been an inside job.

Despite taking a hardline stance on crypto, India has announced that it is working on a national blockchain strategy to accelerate the technology’s adoption. Officials believe that blockchain could transform a plethora of sectors, including governance, banking, finance and cybersecurity. Several Indian states have already been drawing up policies relating to blockchain and artificial intelligence, including Tamil Nadu and Telangana. This month, hopes were raised in the crypto community after a controversial bill that proposes a 10-year jail term for those caught dealing in digital currencies was postponed, with lawmakers failing to introduce it during the winter session of parliament.

It’s been a bad month for Chinese crypto exchanges. In November, at least five platforms have either decided to halt operations temporarily or close up shop altogether. Bitsoda and Akdex brought the shutters down within 24 hours of each other, while Idax announced domestic clients will no longer be able to use its service. Btuex also made moves to suspend services immediately, with the company directly linking this decision to government policy. Biss was the first exchange to fall silent back on Nov. 4 — and since then, it’s been reported that 10 suspects have been arrested in connection with that exchange. All of this comes amid fears that Beijing is doubling down on its anti-crypto stance.

China isn’t the only one threatening to take a hardline stance on crypto. Reports this week also suggested that Russia is planning to ban cryptocurrencies from being used to purchase goods and services. Such a proposal would be a massive setback for countless Russian programmers, designers and copywriters who receive their freelance salaries in BTC and ETH. It is believed that Moscow is concerned about crime, with a senior Ministry of Finance official recently saying: “We do not see any basis for cryptocurrencies to be used as a means of payment.”

After completing a tour of the continent, with stops in Nigeria and Ghana, Jack Dorsey has boldly predicted that “Africa will define the future” — especially when it comes to Bitcoin (BTC). The renowned tech entrepreneur, who is the brains behind Twitter and Square, is a huge supporter of crypto. Dorsey said he is planning to return to Africa in 2020, with a plan to spend up to six months on the continent. His enthusiasm comes as interest in BTC continues to build — especially in Lagos, Nigeria’s most populous city. In other news this week, Ghana announced it is exploring the benefits of issuing a central bank digital currency. It remains unclear when such a project would launch and whether it would be based on blockchain.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $7,470.78, Ether at $151.83 and XRP at $0.22. The total market cap is at $202,919,459,515.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are DMarket, Streamr DATAcoin and Matic Network. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Odem, Digitex Futures and Energi.

Most Memorable Quotations

“Africa will define the future (especially the bitcoin one!)” Jack Dorsey, Twitter and Square CEO

“There are a lot of voices from the Bitcoin community saying that most of the mining is done with green energy and that it’s not high impact.” Susanne Köhler, academic

“The ability to save wealth in bitcoin will bring millions of people out of debt.” Misir Mahmudov, Adaptive Capital

“Beside memorising the pass phrase I also wrote it down in a book. Then now when I keyed in the pass phrase it doesn’t generate the address where I’ve sent 1800 btc to.” Lumanubrecon, Reddit user

“If they [institutional investors] faced a situation of a renewed Bitcoin bubble and they continued to take a contrarian position against the market, they’d be throwing fiat into a black hole.” Bitcoin educator Andreas Antonopoulos

“Nothing is above Bitcoin, no CBDC, no stablecoins.” Blockstream CEO Adam Back

Prediction of the Week

As Bitcoin continues to languish in the mid-$7,000s, some analysts are optimistic that a bounce-back could be on the cards. PlanB has suggested that BTC could return to five-figure territory before 2020 — a surge that would involve the world’s dominant cryptocurrency rising by more than a third. Before you raise your eyebrows and dismiss this as an outlandish prediction, it’s worth remembering that BTC soared by a whopping 42% in a single day back in October — the second-biggest daily gain of all time. Not all analysts agree with PlanB’s rosy prediction. Another statistician, Willy Woo, forecast “a bearish December to test new lows” unless BTC managed to close the month above $8,300.

FUD of the Week

New research suggests cybercriminals have been distributing a Monero (XMR) crypto mining module via the popular video-sharing website YouTube. According to Eset, a major antivirus software supplier, the malware is a marked departure from the click fraud, ad injection and password stealing attacks that Stantinko botnet operators were known for before. It is believed that approximately 500,000 devices have been infected to date. YouTube said it has since removed every channel that contained traces of Stantinko’s code.

Now here’s a FUD that’ll make you wince. A Bitcoin investor claimed they have lost access to funds worth almost $13 million because they failed to record the passphrase for their wallet. The Reddit user said a balance of 1,800 BTC is out of reach. They were apparently using something known as a “brain wallet” — a form of Bitcoin storage that often does away with physical and digital records of passphrases. Instead, users create a password that is easy to recall but difficult to crack. As compelling a story as it might be, some are skeptical as to whether it’s actually true. One moderator, who has marked the tale as likely fake, said: “Why is it called a ‘brain’ wallet when anyone with an actual brain would never do something so stupid? The story is so dumb I assume it is not real.”

A former executive at a digital marketing firm in Hollywood is in hot water after admitting to embezzling $22 million from his employer to buy digital currency, gamble and cover personal expenses. Dennis Blieden was working for StyleHaul Inc. at the time, an agency that represents “influencers” on social networks. Over a four-year period, he stole $1.2 million to write personal checks to poker players, $1.1 million to pay off credit cards and $8.4 million to transfer to crypto accounts. Blieden is now facing a statutory maximum sentence of 22 years in federal prison.

International Expansions

SEBA Bank AG, formerly SEBA Crypto AG, is a crypto-focused bank headquartered in Zug, Switzerland. The bank recently became fully operational and started onboarding Swiss clients after obtaining a banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

The bank has announced that it is extending service to “clients from selected foreign jurisdictions” in December. A spokesperson for the bank told news.Bitcoin.com that the selected jurisdictions are the U.K., Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal, Netherlands, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

SEBA Bank aims to build a bridge between the traditional banking world and the crypto world. Its services include custody storage, trading and liquidity management, asset and wealth management, transaction banking, and tokenization. They are aimed at professional investors, family offices, banks, asset managers, and blockchain companies.

The spokesperson further clarified to news.Bitcoin.com that the bank accepts BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, XLM and NEO for its custody service. As for trading, it accepts BTC, ETH, ETC, LTC, and XLM.

Investment Solutions and Crypto Index

The bank launched its investment business on Tuesday along with its index for crypto assets called the SEBA Crypto Asset Select Index (SEBAX). The bank has selected MV Index Solutions Gmbh (MVIS) to maintain the index and act as its administrator. Gentwo Digital was also brought on board to implement the specific restructuring requirements of the first investment solution, SEBA noted.

SEBAX “is a dynamic, risk-optimized index with a broad market exposure of the crypto asset market,” the bank described. Its objective “is to provide an investable index for the most secure, reliable and tradable crypto assets,” MVIS detailed. “The selection of the constituents is monitored on an ongoing basis. The index applies advanced techniques to reduce concentration into single constituents and to deliver enhanced diversification.”

According to its fact sheet, the index was established on July 2 and currently has five components that are rebalanced monthly. It is calculated daily with the constituent prices converted to USD. A maximum of eight crypto assets ranked by market capitalization are selected for inclusion in the index. MVIS has contracted with Cryptocompare Data Ltd. to maintain and calculate the index. In November, the index components are 48.46% BTC, 26.70% ETH, 18.28% LTC, 3.43% XLM, and 3.13% ETC.

Crypto assets have to meet specific criteria to be eligible for the index and must rank within the top 30 coins by market capitalization. “Stable coins and privacy coins are excluded,” MVIS explained. Also excluded are crypto assets with less 90 days of pricing history, those that are not listed on any of the eligible exchanges, and those that fail the index’s technical maturity and safety criteria.

Since BTC prices slid below the $8K price range, mining operations have been making less revenue. On Sunday, December 1, only 13 mining rigs with an average electricity cost of $0.12 per kWh are profiting at current prices. Of course, miners from China and other regions pay far less per kWh but older mining rigs currently struggle for profits.

High-Powered Mining Rigs Are Still Profitable at Current Prices, Older Devices Not So Much

Mining the SHA256 algorithm is still profitable, no matter which coin you mine, whether it be BTC or BCH. For instance, on Sunday it’s between 0.4-3% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain according to Coin Dance statistics. During the last three hours, the BCH hashrate has been around 4.14 exahash per second (EH/s), while the BTC chain has had around 98.03 EH/s. In the last seven days, BTC has averaged around 87.34 EH/s and BCH has seen 2.60 EH/s.

The past two weeks’ cryptocurrency markets have seen deep losses while BTC slipped below $8K and BCH hovers around $213 per coin. Current prices make it so only 13 mining rigs are profiting today if they pay $0.12 per kWh. This includes the Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro with 53 terahash per second (TH/s), Bitmain Antminer S17 Pro (50 TH/s model), Innosilicon T3+ (52 TH/s), Bitmain Antminer S17e (64 TH/s), Strongu STU-U8 Pro (60 TH/s), Ebang Ebit E11++ (44 TH/s), and Microbt’s Whatsminer M20S (68 TH/s).

At current prices, BTC and BCH miners paying only $0.05 per kWh can choose between a variety of 70 profitable devices. At $0.05 per kWh, any mining rig that can process more than 11 TH/s with decent power efficiency can still make money. Much larger profits between $5-10 per day come from high-powered mining rigs that can process more than 40 TH/s with power outputs between 1500W to 6000W off the wall. With electrical costs at $0.05 per kWh or under, the top mining rigs stem from manufacturers like Bitmain, Microbt, Strongu, Innosilicon, and Bitfury. Machines making below $5 per day are manufactured by firms such as Canaan, Ebang, Holic, and average around 20-38 TH/s.

Microbt Plans to Launch an 81 TH/s Bitcoin Miner

In addition to the top machines that process the SHA256 algorithm, Bitmain’s Antminer S17+ (73 TH/s) will be shipping in December. The 73 TH/s Antminer has a power consumption of 2920W according to specifications. Moreover, regional reports from China reveal that a new Microbt Whatsminer is on the way that processes higher hashrates than the 73 TH/s S17+ model. The company’s current Whatsminer M20S (68 TH/s) can make a touch over $7 per day if electrical costs are at $0.05 per kWh or below. However, a shareholder of Microbt named Wu Gang says that the firm is releasing a M30S model. The shareholder said the new machine will “deliver 81 TH/s” with a “power consumption at 38 watts per terahash.”

Wu also told the Wechat community that the M30S will be supported by Samsung 8nm chips but reports explain that the Japan-South Korea Trade War has put a strain on these efforts. Microbt was founded in 2016 by former Bitmain employee Yang Zuoxing. He was purportedly the processor design director and helped developed Bitmain’s popular S7 and S9 models. After leaving Bitmain, Microbt was sued for allegedly infringing upon Bitmain’s patent for mining rig technology. Moreover, last month, Yang Zuoxing was purportedly held in custody by Chinese police in regards to Bitmain’s intellectual property (IP). Microbt shareholder Wu Gang did not disclose when the Shenzhen-based mining chip manufacturer will release the M30S.

By this figure, Bitcoin, Horizen and Ethereum are the largest networks.



Kwaasteniet is another critic of the measurement method used by the CoinMarketCap which classifies cryptocurrencies by marketcap.



Throughout the year, the crypto data platform, CoinMarketCap, has been criticized for its measurement practices. A data analyst and researcher named Aat de Kwaasteniet has proposed an alternative to this method. Through a publication on Medium, he argues that measuring and ranking cryptocurrencies by the number of users or the number of nodes is much more effective and transparent. By this, he tries to qualify cryptocurrencies by their real use case and not by misleading figures, for example, their market capitalization.

Classification by the number of nodes

A node is a computer running the Bitcoin software (recently updated to Bitcoin Core version 0.19.0.1) which is connected the BTC network. The nodes are in charge of verifying the transactions that take place on the network and that are recorded, publicly, in the blockchain.

According to bitnodes, the number of active Bitcoin nodes is distributed as follows: 25% in the United States, 19% in Germany and 6% in France. The nodes are distributed all over the world, but according to this platform the nodes in other locations are less than 5% of the total number of nodes of the Bitcoin network. In total the Bitcoin network currently comprises for 9,571 nodes.

Kwaasteniet argues, as mentioned above, that the number of active nodes of a cryptocurrency is a much more effective measure of its value in the crypto ecosystem. However, the measure most used by large data collection platforms such as CoinMarketCap is the market capitalization. For the researcher, this is a metric susceptible to manipulation.

Because of that the researcher has developed a new classification method following specific parameters: Coins which have a pre-mine are disqualified; it does also not include wallets as part of active nodes, nodes must be independent (ERC20 tokens cannot participate in the ranking).

Therefore, in order to be classified according to this method it is necessary to have an active network of nodes. According to this, the first cryptocurrency in the ranking is suprisingly Horizen with 30,679 nodes, followed by Bitcoin with 9,461 nodes, and Ethereum with 7,832 nodes. The fourth and fifth place went to two projects that you would not expect to be placed at the top of the ranking: ZCoin and Pac Global. In contrast, big projects like Litecoin (12th), Bitcoin Cash (14th) and Tron (20th) are ranked very low. Ripple is not appearing at all at the list becaue it has a pre-mine.

CoinMarketCap fights against data manipulation

On the other hand, as CNF has reported, Kwaasteniet has not been the only one who expressed criticism towards CoinMaretCap (CMC). However, the data collection platform seems to be making changes to combat data manipulation. Recently, CMC announced that they will introduce a new metric, liquidity.

According to platform representatives, liquidity will make CoinMarketCap’s methodology even more adaptive. In this way, they will be able to account for the current state of the crypto market, reducing the potential risk of data manipulation.

In addition, the platform partnered with Yahoo Finance to bring its metrics to millions of users. With this cooperation, they hope to increase the number of fresh capital entering the crypto market by increasing the transparency and legitimacy of their data.

The term “stacking sats” has become one of the biggest memes in the Bitcoin (BTC) community in 2019. Not a day goes by where you don’t see the hashtag #stackingsats on Crypto Twitter. And, for good reason.

Dollar-cost averaging bitcoin - even with small amounts - could turn out to be a lucrative investment approach for long-term HODLers. And while some researchers claim that a lump sum investment in BTC beats dollar cost averaging in most cases, it’s still might not work for everyone. Therefore, if historic bitcoin returns are anything to go, “stacking sats” may not be such a bad idea.

In this article, you will discover five ways to stack sats in 2019.

Automated bitcoin investing

Arguably one - if not the - best way to “stack sats” is to make use of automated bitcoin investment platforms that enable you to dollar-cost average bitcoin in a fully automated manner. It allows to invest a fixed amount into bitcoin on a regular basis, regardless of the price action, which helps partially neutralize short-term volatility. There are a number of platforms that offer this service, with Coinbase being among the most well-known.

To automate regular bitcoin purchases, you link your bank account to your bitcoin investment app. Then, the platform will purchase your specified amount of bitcoin using funds from your bank account at regular predetermined intervals.

For example, you could choose to invest USD 250 in bitcoin once a month on the day you receive your salary payment. This would enable you to build your bitcoin portfolio over time on autopilot without having to worry too much about volatility as you would be buying during the ups and downs. That means you would end up with an average entry price for your bitcoin trades. Hence, the name dollar-cost averaging.

Bitcoin cashback reward apps

Perhaps a more fun but still equally impactful way to “stack sats” would be to make use of so-called bitcoin cashback apps.

As Cryptonews.com reported in July, there is a growing market for cashback rewards platform that pay users in bitcoin instead of fiat currency. The likes of Fold, Pei, and SatsApp enable users to receive a handful of satoshis every time they make a purchase at a registered merchant.

The arguable leader in this market, however, is Lolli, which has just been named one of CNBC’s Top 100 Upstarts. Lolli provides a browser extension that informs users every time they access a partner e-commerce platform that they can receive cashback in the form of bitcoin. Moreover, it processes the transaction and sends you the BTC after you have made a purchase on one of these platforms.

Lolli and co. have received a lot of positive attention on social media, which has made bitcoin cashback apps one of the most popular ways to stack sats this year.

Coinmine

The recently launched user-friendly, at-home bitcoin mining machine Coinmine has recently announced that it will pay users interest who mine using their machine and leaves their crypto in their designated Coinmine wallets.

The California-based bitcoin startup announced on Twitter that the interest rates it will pay will start at 6.5%, with payouts being made on a monthly basis. This new method of stacking sats enables users to benefit from the power of compound interest, should they decide to leave their mined cryptocurrency in their Coinmine wallets. However, at this stage you might need to spend lots of sats before starting stacking them with Coinmine, which retails for USD 699, and you might need many years before this investment pays back.

Mining Bitcoin using Honeyminer

If mining is something you are interested in, another easy-to-use, plug-and-play way to stack sats is to use the beginner-friendly mining software Honeyminer. Honeyminer enables anyone with a computer to mine bitcoin with the click of a button.

Obviously, if you do not have strong graphic cards or other mining hardware attached to your machine, you will only make a few satoshis. In the spirit of stacking sats, however, Honeyminer has made our list.

Running a Lightning node

Last but not least, you could stack sats by running a Lightning node to supporting the growing Bitcoin Lightning Network.

By providing payment channels to LN users, you can earn satoshis by charging users transaction fees to use your channels. The amount you will earn for running a Lightning node is negligible compared to using cashback apps, for example. But not only would you be earning a few sats to add to your stack, you would also be supporting one of Bitcoin’s most promising scaling solutions.

Start stacking sats

If you believe that bitcoin will continue to increase in value over time, there are a number of ways you can start stacking sats that do not involve accessing an exchange and clicking the buy button as our list shows. Moreover, should bitcoin really “moon,” even a few satoshis could be worth a lot. One satoshi, which represents roughly 0.00000001 BTC, is already worth more than a number of national currencies and if things continue the way they have gone, a satoshi may one day be worth more than a dollar (if dollar still exists by then).",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/48738/with-parliament-approval-german-banks-to-sell-and-custody-crypto-in-2020,,,https://decrypt.co/12621/how-bitcoin-points-to-the-future-of-decentralized-protest,"Protests throughout the world, in Hong Kong, Chile, France, the Middle East and elsewhere, are embracing the principles and products of cryptocurrency—in many cases without even knowing it.

Today’s movements are made up of hundreds and thousands of protestors, groups of disparate individuals aligned around values and causes. The decentralized networks they’ve adopted—reliant on technology rather than leaders—could ensure their longevity. It could also permanently alter the geopolitical landscape.

In the same way, blockchain, the technology that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is reliant on decentralized networks.

But just how closely aligned are these leaderless movements with the similarly decentralized blockchain and cryptocurrencies? And what impact are they having on the adoption of decentralized principles—and, ultimately, on the price and perception of crypto?

No banking on blockchain

The Internet provides a backbone for 21st century rebellion, but is also its weakest link.

The Swiss Army Knife for modern day protesters is the smartphone; a communications tool that’s also a camera, GPS and more besides. The killer app is private, encrypted social media and messaging apps such as Telegram, with its secret chat function.

These tools enable protestors to evade surveillance; form anonymous groups; post video footage; agree how and where to rally, and request additional supplies.

But, earlier this month, Iranian authorities showed how they can be defused.

Mass demonstrations against petrol rises, the result of US sanctions, turned violent but were quickly diffused when Iran pulled the plug on Internet connectivity for over 90% of the country.

It’s not an easy thing to do. But regimes around the world, including those in Russia, have been busy retrofitting traditional private and decentralized networks with cooperation agreements, technical implants, or a combination of both, to give themselves more power over Internet access.

In both Russia and Iran, Telegram has been banned by authorities since last year. But Russian dissidents have managed to find ways around the ban, often using VPNs—Virtual Private Networks—which route an Internet connection through a different country. Telegram founder Pavel Durov has also proved adept at moving the company’s servers to stay one step ahead of authorities.

Decentralized applications, dapps, are also becoming increasingly popular. Messaging apps Bridgefy and FireChat both work by creating a mesh network of users’ mobile phones offline, via Bluetooth. Messages are relayed from phone to phone until they reach their destination.

But the technology is still nascent and not practical in confrontational situations, say protestors. And it’s especially difficult for Iranians to access foreign servers and infrastructure because many companies ban them for fear of US sanctions.

One of the main attractions (and criticisms) of Bitcoin is that it can be used indiscriminately by anyone from protestors to terrorists to sanctioned regimes. Everyone from the Iranian regime, which has mined bitcoin to dodge sanctions, to Ukrainian protestors, who held up signs with QR codes during 2014’s Maidan Square uprising in a bid to raise funds, has taken advantage of its censorship resistance.

Fundraising techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated to evade detection; the armed wing of Palestinian group Hamas reportedly uses a fresh digital wallet for each transaction. But for donations, even cryptocurrency is fallible. Payment processor BitPay was accused of blocking crypto donations to the Hong Kong Free Press for several weeks last October.

A symbiotic relationship?

Of course, being associated with funding for terrorist groups, and other violent organisations, doesn’t do the image of cryptocurrencies any favours.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin proponents such as Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano, believe that the “non-seizability” of Bitcoin becomes ever more attractive in moments of geopolitical crisis.

Data for OTC (Over-the-counter) crypto trades from LocalBitcoins suggests that, during the early months of the Hong Kong protests, peer-to-peer trading increased. A further spike appears to coincide with the protests’ escalation, at the end of last month.

Libertarians point to events in troubled countries such as Chile, which is seeing widespread protests over long-standing economic injustice. ATMs reportedly ran out of cash there earlier this month. They argue that when people experience such measures, they’re more likely to sell local currency for bitcoin to escape the uncertainty surrounding the legacy markets. “Essentially, it's a tool of freedom for people under tyranny and that's significant,” Bitcoin advocate Jimmy Song told Decrypt back in September.

Song has been working with the non-profit Human Rights Foundation to teach activists how Bitcoin might be useful to them. “It’s a significant part of what Bitcoin is supposed to be. It’s becoming a much bigger part of the human rights movement all around the world,” he said.

But while enthusiasts might be quick to suggest that Bitcoin is acting as a “safe haven” for funds, or a protest tool in Hong Kong, analysts warn that reliance on a single source is unwise.

“LocalBitcoins volumes are one indicator but they're hardly reflective of the full BTC market in any given region,” Mati Greenspan, founder of the Quantum Economics newsletter, told Decrypt.

He said that investment funds and analysts are tracking protest movements and political instability as bellwethers of crypto price, but emphasized that economic stability remains the most important factor.

“In countries where the local currency sees massive devaluation the propensity to hold bitcoin is much higher,” he said. Correlations between buying activity and inflation in Venezuela, or political events in Argentina are more likely, he believes.

But that’s assuming funds are accessible. In Lebanon, five weeks of anti-government protests were fuelled by anger at corruption, and bank accounts were frozen. Protestors there reported that digital assets are rarely useful as currency, since citizens were cut off from global exchange platforms.

The philosophy of decentralized protest

Leaderless rebellion is not new, despite recent headlines. In the 1980s, during the last phase of the anti-apartheid struggle, black Africans evaded martial law by organizing in a cell-like structure. A major factor in the movement’s eventual success was the effective coordination of economic boycotts against white businesses by these so-called cells.

Similarly, in the ongoing Hong Kong protests, members of the protest movement made an early decision to eschew centralized leadership. The fact that all the leaders of the unsuccessful 2014 Umbrella movement protest were convicted—and received sentences ranging from two to 16 months—is still fresh in citizens’ minds.

But decentralized protest is mushrooming even in areas of the world where penalties for rebellion are far less severe. The Occupy movement over wealth inequality, which started with Occupy Wall Street, went viral in 2011, after thousands of protestors pitched tents in the heart of New York City.

Most recently, Extinction Rebellion (XR), a global, non-violent protest movement sparked by the lack of government action over climate change, mobilized hundreds of thousands to take part in civil disobedience.

“Decentralized organization gives you a great deal of autonomy, which I think appeals to people who become involved in protests and activism because they tend to be protesting against authority figures and rigid hierarchical structures anyway,” Steve Tooze, a local organizer for XR, told Decrypt.

He believes that, like himself, many of those joining the movement have a minimal history of activism. “I think people are desperate—in our current climate of growing authoritarianism—to feel empowered, and able to have agency of their own, and I think XR gives that to them,” he said.

Tooze praised the fluid and transparent nature of the movement, which seeks to adhere to a detailed constitution, empowering anybody to act so long as they agree to its core principles, But he admitted that the process of reaching consensus on which actions to pursue could be time consuming and frustrating.

But the biggest challenge facing XR, he contends, is the authorities’ determined persecution of figures perceived to be XR leaders. Roger Hallam, one of the movement’s founders, is seen as something of a driving force behind it. Last week, he was accused of anti-Semitism for comments he made about the Holocaust, and disowned by the German faction of the group.

Earlier this year, XR members also disowned a controversial plan he was involved in, to fly drones and disrupt holiday flights at Heathrow, the UK’s busiest airport. The consensus was that it crossed the line of non-violent protest.

But other controversial actions have gone ahead. During one rush-hour protest at London’s Canning Town, protestors attempting to stop trains were dragged down from their roofs by angry commuters.

Tooze said that the Canning Town action was “massively controversial,” but that, like other major actions, it was subject to extensive debate beforehand. He emphasized that, in 99.9% of cases, there were no problems, but explained that “if a group of people decide they’re going to carry out an action, if there are three of you, and you adhere to the principles, you can act in the name of XR.”

XR’s decision-making structures, the connection between loose groups of rebels, and ways to make communications more effective, are all under review, said Tooze. The movement is currently processing an extensive survey among its membership, which will inform the future choices it makes.

“It’s very difficult for mass movements to prevent unwelcome or unhelpful actions or words by minorities among the members—words or actions which can then be used by enemies to judge or condemn the whole movement,” Carne Ross, author of The Leaderless Revolution: How Ordinary People Will Take Power and Change Politics in the 21st Century, told Decrypt.

The only recourse is to emphasize, to the press, that “the minority do not represent the majority, even if it’s inevitable that those who use violence or provocative words will get more attention,” he said.

He added that it was legitimate, in his opinion, to exclude and publicly condemn those who endanger the movement by negative actions or words. A former British diplomat turned anarchist, Ross contends that successful and long-standing examples of leaderless rebellion do exist, and can provide a template for the future.

As an example, he points to the forums that take the place of leadership in Rojava, a region in Northern Syria which revolted against the regime in 2012 and achieved de-facto autonomy as a result. He contends that, thanks to modern communications and social media, such movements can scale with unprecedented speed and range “to a massive extent—that’s what is so exciting about them.”

Technology, he said, means you don’t need a leader to disseminate strategy, which can spread horizontally. And, while authorities can turn off the Internet, it’s not a viable long-term strategy.

“By their nature, communication systems like WhatsApp are decentralized,” said Ross. “That characteristic of decentralization gives the network its power—both as a tool to disseminate information and tactics widely, but also to protect users against the targeting of leaders.”

He also believes that, should a revolution develop into a new and more democratic way of doing things, “a new way of government,” then a role for cryptocurrencies should be anticipated.

But not everyone agrees. In his book The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook, historian Niall Ferguson, warns that a Libertarian utopia—“of free, equal and interconnected netizens”—is a romantic ideal, not borne out by the past experience of history.

“Vast, new networks have been made possible but, like the networks of the past, they are hierarchical in structure, with small numbers of super-connected hubs towering over the mass of sparsely connected nodes,” writes Ferguson.

The powers that lend leaderless protest its force (such as decentralized networks on the Internet) can just as easily be co-opted by the less benign forces they seek to overthrow, he suggests.

So advocates of decentralization through blockchain should keep an eye on how decentralized protest—and the authorities' response to it—is evolving.",2019-12-01 14:30:48,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/12/154673-galaxy-digital-a-full-service-crypto-merchant-bank-records-a-net-loss-of-68-2-million-during-q3/,"Galaxy Digital (TSXV: GLXY), a full-service cryptocurrency merchant bank launched by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, has generated $58.4 million in net income during the first three quarters of this year, which represents a 133% increase from the same financial period in 2018.

In its third-quarter financial report, Galaxy Digital’s management revealed that it recorded a net loss of $68.2 million during Q3 2019, even though the firm posted overall gains during the first three quarters of this year. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading, one of the company’s three main businesses, reported losses of around $43 million.

However, Galaxy Digital’s trading division reported a 47% increase in the number of total onboarded counterparties during Q3 over Q2 2019.

The asset management division of Galaxy Digital currently has $336 million worth of assets under management, as of September 2019. Notably, $325 million of these assets belong to the EOS Fund. The fund has made several strategic venture investments during Q3 of this year, including venture funding contributions to Loopland Group Holding, Versiart, Immutable, Predictive Pop, and FinCo Services.

This year, Galaxy Digital has reportedly invested a total of $156.5 million (as of September 30), which is a $22.9 million decrease from the end of last year. The firm’s total crypto-asset holding stands at $133.5 million, which is a substantial $63.7 million increase from the end of 2018.

Michael Novogratz, founder and CEO at Galaxy Digital, stated:

“While the third quarter proved to be another challenging one for the cryptocurrency markets broadly, the teams here at Galaxy Digital continued to make forward progress across each of our three primary operating business lines as well as to conservatively allocate new capital where we saw pockets of clear value in the industry,”

Some major regulatory developments in the crypto space have transpired this week. Not only has Germany passed a bill allowing banks to sell and store cryptocurrencies, but South Korea and Thailand are also amending their laws to better regulate the crypto industry. We also cover crypto news involving the governments of China, Japan, and the U.S., including the arrest of an Ethereum Foundation member.

German Bill Authorizes Banks to Deal in Crypto

A bill has reportedly been passed in Germany allowing banks to sell and store cryptocurrencies for customers. Starting in 2020, financial institutions in Germany will be able to offer cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, alongside traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. They can also provide crypto custody services to customers. The bill proposes eliminating the requirement for banks to use third-party custodians to manage cryptocurrencies. Banks are currently required to use “external custodians or special subsidiaries” to store cryptocurrencies. They will need to procure a license to offer crypto services.

Meanwhile, banks in Germany have increasingly been passing on the burden of negative interest rates to their retail and corporate clients. A recent survey by the country’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, shows that 58% of surveyed banks are already charging some clients negative interest rates.

South Korea Creating Legal Framework for Crypto

Cryptocurrency businesses will also soon be directly regulated in South Korea. A new bill passed by the South Korean National Assembly’s national policy committee will bring crypto exchanges directly under the supervision of the Financial Services Commission’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

The bill amends the Act on Reporting and Using Specified Financial Transaction Information to establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies, classifying them as digital assets. Among other obligations, the bill requires crypto exchanges to register with the FIU and establish a system that complies with the standards set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Thailand Seeks to Become More Crypto-Friendly

Another Asian country that is planning to amend its cryptocurrency regulation is Thailand. The existing Thai crypto regulation went into effect in May 2018, installing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the main regulator of the industry. SEC Secretary-General Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol reportedly said on Nov. 25 that the regulator is studying whether the current regulation has any areas impeding the growth of the digital asset industry. She was quoted by the Bangkok Post as saying, “The regulator must be flexible to apply the rules and regulations in line with the market environment,” adding:

Laws should not be outdated and should serve market needs, especially for new digital asset products, and be competitive with the global market. We need to explore any possible obstacles.

Under current laws, sellers and promoters of unauthorized digital tokens will be fined up to twice the value of the transactions or at least 500,000 baht ($16,534). They could also face a jail term of up to two years. Further, crypto traders will be liable for a 7% value-added tax (VAT) and 15% withholding tax on capital gains, the news outlet detailed. Retail investors, however, will be exempt from VAT if they trade crypto assets through authorized exchanges.

US Arrests Ethereum Foundation Member

This week the U.S. government has taken two notable actions affecting the crypto industry. The first action, which has resulted in outrage across the crypto community, is the arrest of 36-year-old Virgil Griffith, a well-known member of the crypto community who worked with the Ethereum Foundation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alleges that the American citizen, who is a resident of Singapore, violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by teaching North Koreans to evade sanctions. He is charged with conspiring to violate the IEEPA, which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison.

Secondly, the Western District of Washington court has denied a motion to quash an IRS summons for a crypto trader’s Bitstsamp transaction data. The judge ruled that “the IRS’ request for those records does not infringe upon the petitioner’s Fourth Amendment rights.”

China’s Report and Japan’s Tax Law

Following the blockchain hype initiated by President Xi Jinping and a subsequent announcement by the central bank’s Shanghai Head Office, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) published a financial stability report for 2019. It reveals that 173 domestic crypto trading and digital token platforms have “exited without risk” after the cleanup announcement issued in September 2017 by seven Chinese regulators.

Over in Japan, the Cabinet has answered a question regarding the use of cryptocurrency for tax payments. While the Japanese inheritance tax law allows real estate and properties to be used to pay taxes, the answer explains that crypto assets cannot be used for this purpose.

As local business-focused publication Business Report reported on Dec. 2, SARB’s deputy governor, Kuben Naidoo, said that the new rules will be implemented in the first quarter of 2020, following a five-year-long series of consultations on the matter.

Naidoo’s statements followed a decision of FirstRand Bank — one of the largest financial institutions in South Africa — to discontinue providing banking services to digital currency exchanges in late November. FNB reportedly blamed regulatory uncertainty for the move.

The blockchain and crypto communities have already responded to the idea of further controls on cryptocurrency. South African blockchain development community SA Crypto told Business Report:

“The implications of the Sarb clamping down on cryptocurrency use for the purpose of stricter capital controls are far-reaching and alarming.”

Crypto popularity in South Africa

Cryptocurrencies have proved to be popular in South Africa, with 10.7% of the country’s residents owning crypto, which is the highest of any country surveyed. The South African rand’s volatility, which is one of the world’s most volatile currencies, prompted consumers to seek protection for their money.

Cross-border payments are a contributing factor of crypto popularity in the country, especially given how remittances are often sent from countries like South Africa to 15 other countries on the continent in what is known as the Southern African Development Community.

In August, major South African crypto exchange Luno saw an average daily trading volume exceeding 80 million South African rand ($5.4 million). Luno saw a significant surge of new customers, reaching a milestone of three million wallets across 40 countries on its platform.

Marius Reitz, general manager for Africa at Luno, said that this indicated increasing global adoption and reinforces the company’s purpose of “reimagining a financial system where money is cheaper, faster and safer with open and equal access for everyone.”

BRICS’s crypto for united payment system

In the meantime, members of BRICS — including South Africa — discussed the creation of a new cryptocurrency at a recent summit in mid-November. The director-general of the Russian Direct Investment Fund Kirill Dmitriev said at the time:",,https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/top-crypto-exchange-adds-xrp-support-price-down-1-5-alongside-bitcoin/,"A top cryptocurrency exchange has just added XRP, despite the falling price of the popular altcoin over recent weeks.

According to a press release published to the website of Bitflyer, the most popular exchange in Japan deemed to be one of the more legitimate trading platforms in the crypto space, the exchange will be adding XRP for its “Altcoin Market” starting Monday, December 2nd. XRP is the second-most traded cryptocurrency in Japan according to the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (a collective of cryptocurrency trading platforms), the release notes. Bitflyer has added support for the cryptocurrency to its native exchange and its Bitflyer wallet application available on iOS and Android.

To promote this new feature, Bitflyer has announced a promotion. 10 customers who trade XRP during the campaign period of December 2nd to the 26th will win 100,000 JPY (~$100). Those eligible to be entered into the competition will be determined by if they make “at least one trade on the Ripple (XRP) Market of at least a total of 5,000 JPY in Ripple during the campaign period.”

As industry outlet The Block observed in its article on the matter, Bitflyer is one of the exchanges deemed by Bitwise Asset Management, crypto-centric financial services and research firm, to be facilitating legitimate Bitcoin trading, unlike “95%” of the rest of the industry.

XRP Price Downtrend

Despite this positive news, the cryptocurrency has posted a 1.5% loss in the past 24 hours. And unfortunately, for holders of the altcoin, it may get worse. Per previous reports from Ethereum World News, popular analyst TraderSZ believes XRP’s performance against the U.S. dollar isn’t looking too hot. In fact, the cryptocurrency has slipped under $0.23 again after showing some strength earlier this week. He thus remarked that as long as XRP remains under the mid-range level of $0.266, he would be inclined to suggest that a move to $0.135 — some 40-45% lower than current prices — will pan out over the coming weeks and months.

Another analyst, Magic, has echoed this, writing in a recent TradingView post that $0.15 is in the asset’s future due to a confluence of factors: XRP has lost the support of an uptrend channel it has been situated in for a majority of its history as a tradable asset and the 50-week and 200-week moving averages have purportedly been lost as well.

Photo by Clay Banks on Unsplash",,https://www.cfo.com/payments/2019/12/the-5-biggest-trends-in-cryptocurrency-for-2020/,"Speculation is at the heart of the cryptocurrency market. Obviously, price speculation is present across all assets, but most thriving cryptocurrencies have survived largely thanks to speculation about their anticipated applications and promised potential.

Of course, this speculative quality has also been at the heart of the volatility in the crypto market. Bad actors and shady token schemes flood the space, new blockchain or contract technology is overhyped or undelivered, financial markets struggle to figure out what crypto means for them, all lead to the kinds of massive spikes and dips that the market has come to be known for.

While 2020 might not calm the crypto market down, it does promise to deliver some important developments that will help the new asset mature and provide a sense of how it might become a core feature in the future of finance.

Based on ongoing and upcoming trends in the cryptocurrency market and through conversations with industry veteran and co-founder of cryptocurrency tracking and tax software company Accointing Alex Lindenmeyer, Benzinga has compiled a list of five of the most notable cryptocurrency events, trends, and developments that are likely to shape the digital asset market through 2020.

The Halvening

The most concrete event that will take place in 2020 is the bitcoin halving in May, which will reduce the number of bitcoins rewarded for successfully mining a block in the digital ledger by half, from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. Even though it sounds dramatic, it’s happened twice before and each event saw some interesting price action. In the months surrounding the 2012 halving, bitcoin price went from less than $10 to more than $100 while in 2016 the currency surged from $400 before the halving to more than twice that by the end of the year.

At its face, halving introduces new scarcity to the market and bitcoin traders are already anticipating similar supply-side price growth as the past two halvings. However, traders shouldn’t forget that demand is also necessary in driving price. As bitcoin mining becomes less lucrative, the number of miners competing for a block will fall as will the hash rate necessary for mining until an equilibrium is reached.

Of course, expectations might be all that’s required to see an effect. “There are arguments for and against a price increase, the main argument against it being that the majority of people are expecting it,” said Alex. “What I know for certain is that there will be a lot of volatility due to speculation.”

The halving is aimed at stabilizing the supply of bitcoins as it approaches full saturation and there are no more bitcoins to be mined. After that, well, bitcoins may become rarer and more valuable than gold, or Satoshi Nakamoto could create more bitcoins to be mined so the coin’s price can continue to be moderated, or it could gradually lose value to more abundant or practical digital currencies like Bitcoin Cash, which forked off from the original Bitcoin in 2017 for just that purpose. Ultimately, the world’s first cryptocurrency still needs to decide whether its scarcity alone defines its value.

Enter Libra

The flipside of this is libra, the asset-backed stablecoin that Facebook announced earlier this year, although it won’t be available until at least the summer of 2020, if and when it clears the necessary regulatory hurdles. In any event, a lot of uncertainties remain about the new stablecoin that has backing from the likes of Uber, Vodafone, Coinbase and even a member of the Kushner family. Part of these uncertainties prompted other interested parties like Mastercard, eBay, and Paypal Holdings, to bow out of the cryptocurrency altogether.

However, the one certainty around libra is that it will have a potential user base of nearly 170 million in the United States alone. Thanks to Facebook’s omnipresence, their adoption of libra and its associated Calibra wallet will mean that users of the social network, many of whom have never touched a cryptocurrency, might suddenly be paying their Uber drivers with the stuff.

Accointing’s co-founder viewed the issue as a matter of bringing an air of legitimacy to cryptocurrency, saying, “Stablecoins are hugely important to the space. For adoption, it is important to be able to easily switch between a store of value and a stable currency you can use daily. Furthermore [libra] will broaden the understanding that money doesn’t have to come from countries. Alone, the discussion around libra this year just got people thinking about cryptocurrencies.”

Depending on how well this model is adopted — and pending the already massive scrutiny from government regulators — libra could well mark the point at which cryptocurrency goes mainstream, and other tech and finance companies will certainly follow.

The Feds Step In

Of course, that government scrutiny thing is ultimately a large missing piece of the puzzle. Two-thousand nineteen revealed a growing awareness on the part of federal agencies that cryptocurrency (and technology in general) is beginning to become less a component of society and more of the core element of it. The Federal Reserve revealed recently the U.S. central bank is mulling over a potential digital analogue for the greenback. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service has firmed up its guidance on reporting cryptocurrency transactions for the coming tax season.

Now with one of the biggest and most controversial tech companies in the world getting in on the cryptocurrency game, the cryptocurrency industry will likely see local and national governments pay closer attention to the digital currencies, for good or ill. For his part, Alex sees the current outlook on guidance and regulations in cryptocurrency as mostly benign.

“If you look at tax rulings overall, they haven’t been terribly against crypto […] they are being extremely progressive, with countries like Singapore, Switzerland, and Portugal making great strides for crypto.” said Alex, “Their policy is undefined, but the government still wants us to pay taxes. I’m just hopeful that next year we will get a lot more clear guidance, specifically on airdrops, and staking.”

While most of the current legislation has been encouraging, ongoing experiments may cut both ways for the larger cryptocurrency market. Supportive regulations like those highlighted by Alex promise to foster growth and increase transparency throughout the industry. On the other hand, highly restrictive regulations like those coming out of China could mean increased turmoil for digital assets.

The Market Consolidates

Turmoil might be a characteristic feature lower on the cryptocurrency food chain. Because, despite flattening in 2018 as the price of bitcoin fell, the number of cryptocurrencies in the market surged to more than 2300 through 2019, according to the latest account from CoinMarketCap.

Unfortunately, fewer than a third of coins trade more than $100,000 of volume in a day. Meanwhile, more than a third are valued at less than a tenth of a penny. The result is that there are more coins in the cryptocurrency market now than ever before, but the total amount of capital has flatlined throughout 2019.

While a potential upswing in cryptocurrency interest from mainstream finance might contribute to a subsequent increase of capital, it’s unlikely to trickle down to the very smallest coins. What’s more, as greater scrutiny comes to the market, regulatory burdens and increased transparency among the larger players will likely root out those just trying to make quick coin. In any case, the market has probably reached a saturation point, and the number of available coins is unlikely to grow through 2020.

Crypto and Fintech Hook Up

The overarching theme of all of these trends is that cryptocurrency is growing up, becoming mainstream and finally finding actual use cases, rather than just hypothetical ones. With the introduction of libra, the problem isn’t explaining why cryptocurrency will be valuable and necessary soon but making it valuable and necessary now — do or die.

There are obviously questions about how transactions will be implemented across an array of ledgers or how anonymized transactions can be regulated. Part of this will come in the consolidation of the industry and the continued struggle for interoperability between wallets and ledgers. However, most of these questions will likely be answered by whoever tries first, and financial technology companies are by far the most eager to fill that role.

Explaining how he stated Accointing, Alex said bluntly, “Honestly, the answer is quite simple: there was a need for it and the current tools didn’t cut it for us. The crypto ecosystem needed a platform that can be an investor’s backend system — tracking, management and taxes all in one.”

This necessity of innovation has been an evident trend throughout major areas of the cryptocurrency market. Libra itself is (or was) stacked with members from various fintech companies. Meanwhile, fintech unicorns like Plaid and Chime have reached their valuations largely from investments by companies in the finance industry like Visa and Goldman Sachs Group that are curious about digital assets, but terrified of the uncertainty that surrounds them.

The point is, 2020 will be a put-up-or-shut-up moment for cryptocurrency. Either coins start to prove their merit, or they will start to disappear.

The Vertcoin (VTC) blockchain was 51% attacked on Sunday, December 1, which saw 603 VTC blocks replaced by 553 blocks from the attacker. This is the second time the ASIC resistant Vertcoin chain was ambushed, as the network suffered a 300-block reorg a year ago.

Vertcoin 51% Attacked Again

Vertcoin, a fork of the Bitcoin protocol, is an alternative cryptocurrency that’s been around since January 2014. The community and developers behind the project believe VTC is different because it claims to be ASIC resistant. However, throughout October and December 2018, the Vertcoin network dealt with a series of 51% attacks and a number of blockchain reorganizations (reorg).

A 51% attack is when a single entity (miner) takes more than 50% of the network’s hashpower, allowing them to reorg blocks and double spend coins. The 300-block reorg on Vertcoin last year cost more than $100,000 from double spends. The situation invoked VTC developers to change its proof-of-work algorithm to another algorithm called Lyra2rev3. Less than a year later on December 1, 2019, the Vertcoin chain suffered another 51% attack. James Lovejoy, Vertcoin’s lead developer, explained the situation:

On Sunday, 1 December 2019 15:19:47 GMT 603 blocks were removed from the VTC main chain and replaced by 553 attacker blocks. We note that 600 blocks is the current confirmation requirement for VTC on Bittrex. There were 5 double-spent outputs in which ~ 125 VTC (~$29) was redirected. Each of the double-spent outputs are coinbase outputs owned by the attacker and it is unknown to whom the coins were originally sent before being swept to an attacker address after the reorg.

Cloud-Mining Service Nicehash Blamed Again

Similarly to last year’s attack, the captured hashrate was blamed on Nicehash. The company sells hashpower to individuals and acts as a hashpower broker marketplace that connects sellers and miners. Lovejoy remarked that he noticed on November 30 “a large upswing in hashrate rental prices for Lyra2rev3 on Nicehash.” “This was combined with workers connected to Nicehash’s stratum server being sent work for unknown (non-public) Vertcoin blocks,” Lovejoy added. Last year’s attack was blamed on Nicehash too when observers said “there’s too much hashrate for rent at too low a price, resulting in zero capex and low opex to do attacks.” Despite being ASIC resistant, cloud-mining services are now able to offer customers significant portions of CPU and GPU-based hashrates.

Resisting mining centralization has been a huge concern for a variety of blockchains and the Monero (XMR) network has had its share of grievances as well. Last year XMR saw multiple forks as developers tried to bolster ASIC resistance. In May 2018, the Bitcoin Gold (BTG) project suffered a 51% attack and lost $18 million in one fell swoop. A large portion of the BTG double spends from the attack was stolen from Bittrex, eventually causing the U.S. exchange to delist BTG.

With Sunday’s Vertcoin attack, Lovejoy emphasized that “it is possible that Bittrex was the original target.” However, the double spends were aborted because Bittrex had their wallet disabled. “It is also possible that no double spend was ever intended, and the attack was a proof of concept or sabotage attack,” Lovejoy added. Lovejoy said the post-attack analysis of the Nicehash order book at the time of the attack had shown “a large upswing in hashrate rental price” from both U.S. and EU markets. But after the attack, the rental price subsided, Lovejoy stressed, returning to the baseline market equilibrium.

What could crypto, as well as blockchain, solve?

Advocates say there are many issues beyond currency volatility where crypto and blockchain could make a difference.

Aside from remittances and currency volatility, financial inclusion is another hot-button topic in Africa. Research from the World Bank suggests that many of the world’s 1.7 billion unbanked are on the continent, while 2 in 3 adults in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to a bank account.

In some ways, Africa is better prepared for a move to crypto than other continents. Mobile money has already been a key driver in reducing the numbers of unbanked adults, and the World Bank says the continent is home to all eight countries where more than 1 in 5 adults solely rely on a mobile-only account. Given how many consumers are already open to using this technology, crypto exchanges and wallets that offer fully functional apps for mobile users are set to benefit immensely.

Blockchain is also showing plenty of promise. As a recent Cointelegraph article explained, stakeholders in the region say distributed ledger technology will be instrumental in solving long-standing developmental issues and unlocking much-needed economic growth. Nigerian politicians believe that blockchain will drive the world’s fourth industrial revolution, and, for the first time, Africa has the opportunity to have a seat at the table. Fintech companies across the continent are growing substantially. Hotspots include Cape Town, where the number of startups being established has risen 23%, and Nairobi, where there has been a 28% rise.

There is also hope that blockchain technology can help bring around dramatic improvement to the infrastructure in Africa. In Nigeria, companies are working together to see whether blockchain can be implemented in a push to make the nation’s roads safer. The West African nation of Sierra Leone has been working on the development of a blockchain-based ID system for its citizens amid hopes it could enable financial institutions to verify identities and build credit histories in a way that wasn’t possible before. Uganda has also teamed up with a blockchain startup to clamp down on the supply of counterfeit drugs nationwide, with reports suggesting that up to 10% of prescriptions result in fake medicine.",2019-12-02 08:25:00+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-crypto-exchange-adds-four-trading-pairs-for-russian-ruble,"Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance listed four Russian ruble trading pairs, according to an announcement on Dec. 2.

The first trading pairs featuring the ruble include Binance Coin (BNB), Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and XRP. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao commented on the development in a tweet sent the same day.

Binance’s addition of trading pairs follows the introduction of ruble trading on the platform in late October when Zhao announced that users could then deposit and withdraw fiat funds in rubles.

Zhao has previously lauded Russia’s position as an important jurisdiction for the crypto and blockchain industries, recognizing the wealth of computer science talent in Russia, and going so far as calling President Vladimir Putin the most influential person in the blockchain industry.

New additions

Rubble support and trading pairs are the latest in a series of new features and assets added to the platform over the last few months. In November alone, Binance added support for the Turkish lira and also became the first exchange to add the Fiat Gateway developed by stablecoin operator Paxos.

In late October, the exchange also launched support for the Nigerian naira. According to Coinmarketcap, over the last 24 hours, the currency has seen a little over $43,000 in trading volume against Bitcoin, and nearly $25,000 against stablecoin Binance USD (BUSD).

Fierce competition

Meanwhile, competitor cryptocurrency trading platforms to Binance are also expanding their scope of operations. As Cointelegraph reported in mid-November, Bitcoin futures trading on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)’s Bakkt platform will expand to include a cash-settled option.

In mid-November, crypto exchange OKEx launched Bitcoin futures contracts that are margined with the Tether (USDT) stablecoin.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-the-upcoming-bitcoin-halving-compares-to-previous-cycles/,"How the Upcoming Bitcoin Halving Compares to Previous Cycles

For those standing very close to the crypto charts, it might be easy to get discouraged by the gloomy nature of recent markets. However, new comparisons of the current halving cycle to those in the past have emerged and might put some wind back into the sails of traders, hodlers, and cryptocurrency enthusiasts in general.

Miners Unfazed as Halving Approaches

Though crypto prices took a big dip in November, with BTC falling 30% from a high of $9,486 to a bottom of around $6,575, hash rates on both the BTC and BCH chains have held relatively steady as the next block reward halving approaches. Data also points to miners hoarding coins in view of the upcoming subsidy reduction, as the event is generally viewed as price favorable. In combination with these factors, new analysis has emerged which might suggest that in spite of the recent bearish climate, things might be more on track than previously supposed.

Comparing Halving Cycles

The image above aligns the block reward halving points of three cycles (the latter half of pre-halving and the first half of post-halving), with the three cycles anchored at a common line of 100% of the cycle low. The first two cycles which are completed, and the pre-halving phase of the current cycle are displayed. Interestingly, the movements in the latter half cycles appear to follow a similar trend. As creator of the graphic, @Chartsbtc, states on their Twitter post:

Each cycle is 210,000 blocks (~4 years). This chart starts half way through the cycle and goes half way into the next cycle. This is my attempt to show the lows prior to halving and the peaks post halving but keep everything centered around the halving.

The graphic is compelling, and has many hoping for great moves price-wise in 2020 and beyond. Discussing the methodology of creating the graphic further, @Chartsbtc explains why the green price action line does not touch the 100% cycle low level: “The low was a intraday price and the chart only plots the closing prices to the nearest 105th block. I wish I actually had prices per block.” They further note that viewers should “Keep in mind that each cycle peak will likely be lower than the prior one.” Even so, should the trend repeat BTC could see a post-halving peak around $80,000. Still, this is all speculation, and other factors must be kept in mind.

Into 2020

With the Bitcoin Core halving estimated to be taking place in mid-May, 2020, and the Bitcoin Cash halving to likely occur a month earlier, speculation of course abounds. Other factors playing into market perception and possibly price, such as proliferating development surrounding the BCH chain, and a trend of businesses dropping BTC as a payment method due to fees and congestion (not to mention an overall shift in attitude in the BTC community from user to mere hodler), could also have unexpected affects. If the projections of the above halving data are correct, however, everyone may be in for an interesting ride in 2020.

The exchange rates and logos of Bitcoin (BTH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are seen on the display of a cryptocurrency ATM of blockchain payment service provider Vaerdex at the headquarters of Swiss Falcon Private Bank in Zurich, Switzerland May 29, 2019. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann

Virgil Griffith, 36, a U.S. citizen who works for the Ethereum Foundation, told fellow digital currency experts in April 2018 about his intention to arrange the delivery into North Korea of equipment to create ether, two sources told Reuters at the time.

Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, are created through a computer process called mining, which requires powerful hardware. Once generated, they can be exchanged on anonymous online platforms for fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, which in turn can help illicit activities like evading sanctions or laundering money.

One of the sources said Griffith said it would be “really cool” if ether were mined in North Korea.

Reuters was unable to determine whether Griffith’s plans to send the equipment to North Korea, which have not been previously reported, came to fruition. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Griffith for a different incident, accusing him of sharing valuable technical information during a conference in North Korea in April 2019.

“We dispute the untested allegations in the criminal complaint,” said Brian Klein, Griffith’s attorney, in a written statement. “Virgil looks forward to his day in court, when the full story can come out.”

Klein added that he was pleased that a judge found that his client should be released from jail pending trial.

A spokesman for the Ethereum Foundation declined to comment on the mining plans.

U.S. prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment.

According to the federal complaint, Griffith traveled to North Korea via China this April to attend the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference, despite being denied permission by the U.S. Department of State to go.

There, he and other attendees discussed how cryptocurrency technology could be used by Pyongyang to launder money and evade sanctions, the prosecutors said.

Griffith, who faces up to 20 years in prison, acknowledged in a consensual interview with the FBI in November that his presentation amounted to a transfer of technical knowledge to other attendees, the complaint said.

The Ethereum Foundation said in a written statement that it is aware of the recent charges filed against Griffith and that it was not represented in any capacity at the events outlined in the Justice Department’s filing. The “Foundation neither approved nor supported any such travel, which was a personal matter”, it added.

The complaint says Griffith and others combined and conspired to violate rules in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act from as early as August 2018. But the two sources said Griffith was talking about his interest in helping North Korea create ether at least since April that year, when cryptocurrency and blockchain experts gathered for an industry conference in Seoul’s Walkerhill Hotel.

Griffith, who lives in Singapore, said that he planned to get the equipment through China into North Korea with the help of a Singaporean friend who was going to be in Pyongyang to participate in the annual marathon, the people said.

Griffith, who has a doctorate from the California Institute of Technology, said at the time the plan was to have someone hand deliver the equipment to North Korea’s telecom agency, one of the sources said.",2019-12-03 16:04:27+00:00,https://qz.com/1753676/for-bitcoin-boring-is-the-new-normal/,"Bitcoin is in a funk. For the last two months, the leading cryptocurrency has remained within a narrow band, fluctuating between $7,000 and $9,000. On occasion, it has creeped higher or lower, but never for long.

Compared to its stunning rise two years ago, when bitcoin’s price vaulted to $20,000, the crypto market now looks sleepy. The highs aren’t as high, and the lows aren’t as low. The booms and busts have become less frequent, too.

“The overall crypto markets have a tendency to be event-driven, and in the past few months there hasn’t been news to send prices moving meaningfully,” Andy Bromberg, president of CoinList, a startup that enables crypto-based fundraising, surmised to Quartz. In October, his company raised $10 million to continue its service.

For his part, Bromberg thinks the market is entering a new phase. “What’s interesting is that bitcoin is becoming less correlated with the rest of the [crypto] market, an indicator of how its narrative, value, and popularity are emerging even more strongly,” he said. “Because of bitcoin’s decreasing correlation, there’s a reasonable chance that the next time the market moves, it will be either bitcoin or the rest of the market, not both.”

But even now, that’s as good as the predictions get. For mainstream investors, that’s not much to go on. All that’s clear is this: Bitcoin has gotten relatively boring.

Earlier this year, between January and March, bitcoin’s price also stalled. For almost three months, it floundered in the mid-$3,000s. A mid-year revival finally occurred after Facebook revealed plans for Libra, its own digital currency. The project, however, appears unlikely to launch on schedule.

Bitcoin’s highs and lows

Year Max price Minimum Difference 2016 $979 $355 $624 2017 $20,089 $756 $19,333 2018 $17,712 $3,191 $14,521 2019 $13,796 $3,391 $10,405

So, where does that leave us? In a year when the S&P 500 has delivered a 20% year-to-date return, bitcoin has rewarded speculators with a 90% return. This year hasn’t been a mania, but it hasn’t been a “crypto winter,” or stagnation, either. Instead, 2019 has been unpredictable in its own way—and at times, it’s been surprisingly stable. Of course, “stable” is relative—bitcoin is still far more volatile than the average stock.

Calling this a rejuvenation would be too ebullient, but the bitcoin market has exhibited signs of life once again. If anything, 2019 has shown that bitcoin is neither savior nor destroyer of money. As other crypto projects have stumbled, bitcoin has simply persisted. Maybe that’s good enough.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sofi-obtains-bitlicense-to-offer-crypto-trading-services-in-new-york,"California-based financial firm SoFi has acquired a BitLicense from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the regulator said in a statement on Dec. 3.

SoFi is now one of 24 crypto-related firms that have obtained a BitLicense since 2015, Bloomberg Law’s crypto reporter Lydia Beyoud tweeted the same day.

Specifically, SoFi has acquired two licenses — a virtual currency license (BitLicense) and a money transmitter license — that will allow SoFi Digital Assets to offer crypto trading services to its New York customers.

According to the announcement, the firm is authorized to support a total of six digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC) and Stellar (XLM).

Client demand for solid regulations

NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell noted the authority’s commitment to fostering innovation in New York’s crypto ecosystem, stating, ""The Department's approval of SoFi's virtual currency and money transmitter licenses provides consumers with more choices in a continuously evolving global financial services marketplace.""

SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said that the decision to pursue a BitLicense was a response to client demand:

""Putting our members' interests first is our top priority at SoFi [...] That includes both offering individuals the products they want, like cryptocurrency within SoFi Invest, as well as protecting them, through a solid regulatory framework like that created by the NYDFS.”

The news comes after the company launched zero-fee cryptocurrency trading to its platform SoFi Invest in September. SoFi, which has been in partnership with major American crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase since February 2019, rolled out commission-free trading for BTC, ETH and LTC.

A BitLicense is a major business license for cryptocurrencies with a number of terms and conditions such as rules on operating with digital currencies, its control, administration, maintenance, storing and issuing, among others. Earlier this year, NYDFS granted a BitLicense to two subsidiaries of crypto derivatives firm Seed CX — Seed Digital Commodities Market LLC and Zero Hash LLC.",,https://www.coindesk.com/wisdomtree-launches-physically-backed-bitcoin-etp-on-six-swiss-exchange,"A new bitcoin exchange traded product (ETP) has just listed on Switzerland’s SIX stock exchange, and it’s physically backed by the underlying crypto.

Launched by New York-based WisdomTree – one of largest ETF providers in the U.S. – on Tuesday, the new product will compete with a similar physically backed bitcoin ETP from Amun AG on SIX.

At press time, the WisdomTree ETP (ticker symbol BTCW) is live on SIX’s platform, but showing no volume as of yet. A physically backed product is settled in the underlying asset, not a cash equivalent.

WisdomTree said its Bitcoin ETP gives investors “a simple, secure and cost-efficient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin while utilising the best of traditional financial infrastructure and product structuring.”

With the product there is no need to hold the cryptocurrency directly, with the firm saying it employs “institutional grade storage solutions” for the bitcoin underlying the product. As with gold ETPs, investors in the bitcoin product will have an entitlement to the cryptocurrency underlying it.

“We have been monitoring cryptocurrencies for some time and … have seen enough to believe that digital assets, like Bitcoin, are not a passing trend and can play a role in portfolios,” said Alexis Marinof, head of Europe at WisdomTree.

The firm sees “many parallels” between cryptocurrency and commodities, according to Marinof, whose firm has been providing gold-based ETPs in Europe since 2003.

While the product is currently available for professional investors only, WisdomTree said it hopes that a cryptocurrency ETP may soon receive regulatory approval for wider access by retail investors too.",2019-12-03 12:09:54+00:00,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/03/danish-bank-ban-employees-buying-bitcoin-in-own-time/,"A Danish bank has successfully won a court case that means it can now prevent its staff from buying Bitcoin BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

That sounds fine on the surface, but a potential ban doesn’t refer to buying cryptocurrency “on the job,” it extends into employees’ private lives.

According to a release made by Danish court yesterday, Nordea Bank is now free to prevent its staff from buying and trading cryptocurrencies in their own time, Bloomberg reports. They are also banned from buying crypto on behalf of others too.

Staff are not allowed to buy Bitcoin on their own account or on behalf of others

How the bank will enforce a ban and what happens if someone breaches the policy remains unclear.

The bank will let its staff continue to hold any crypto they already own, but it is “encouraging” them to sell what they have and refrain from making future investments.

The dystopia is here.

Nordea bank has cited risks and a lack of industry regulation for its decision to advise staff against messing with the digital assets. But even so, a company dictating what staff can and can’t do in their personal lives seems to be overstepping a boundary.

But that’s not all.

Nordea will let its staff invest in the bank’s own cryptocurrency-based products and financial instruments. So that’s ok? But regular Bitcoin isn’t, go figure.

Product development staff at Nordea will be allowed to make “minor investments in cryptocurrency” if they have a legitimate business reason for doing so.

The irony doesn’t stop there, though. As CoinDesk points out, Nordea bank has previously been investigated for money laundering. Reuters reported earlier this year that the bank‘s headquarters were searched in relation to the claims.

The court-issued press release also says that staff should not conduct trades in financial instruments to the point that it puts their own financial position in jeopardy.

Sure it sounds bad, and the thought of a company dictating what its staff can and can’t do outside of work makes my skin crawl, but it would look quite bad for a bank to have employees that appear to make awful financial decisions. It makes sense that a bank wouldn’t want its staff taking risks on Bitcoin, it happens to the best of us.",2019-12-03 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/12710/xrp-worst-performing-crypto-of-year-2019,"The past 12 months have been a trying time for Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency and the XRP Army.

As we near the end of 2019, XRP has lost almost 93 percent of its value since its all-time high, and the cryptocurrency is set to close out the year as the worst-performing coin among the top 10 by market cap. According to data from analytics site Coinlib, the price of XRP has dropped 51 percent since the beginning of the year.

Close behind XRP is Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which has lost around 49 percent of its value. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is so far the best-performing coin of the year, having gained 17 percent since the start of 2019.

In terms of its place among market leaders by market capitalization, Ripple’s XRP has shown some stability. While it managed to reach the runner-up spot in the rankings for a few days this year, the token has largely remained in a solid third place among the top cryptocurrencies in the market—despite its sharp drop in price.

During the months of October and November, XRP started to show signs of growth, challenging the rest of the market, which remained bearish at the time. However, whatever joy experienced by the XRP Army was short-lived. After breaking resistance levels at $.30 per token, the price of XRP has since fallen back to minimum levels.

When it comes to causing sensation in the crypto space, there are few figures like 2020 Libertarian presidential candidate John McAfee. The controversial crypto champion took time out with news.Bitcoin.com to discuss his presidential campaign, the clampdown of regulators on crypto, and even the futility of BTC maximalism. Not to mention his spin on the popular ‘Epstein didn’t kill himself’ meme.

A Growing Surveillance State

Asked about the recent FBI arrest of Ethereum Foundation member Virgil Griffith, and the climate of the crypto world in general, rogue politician and freedom advocate John McAfee is at no loss for words.

“You know, we’ve turned into a surveillance police state in America, where anything that threatens what the FBI or the CIA determines is national security — it can be defined as anything now,” he remarks. “For example, the FBI is defining ‘extremist groups,’ and they’re giving an example of people who believe that the United States government would lie and use devious practices.”

“Seriously it’s gone crazy. My heart goes out to the man [Griffith], I mean he did no less than me when I was in Cuba and offered to assist in blockchain to get around U.S. sanctions.”

America’s Feudalist Regression

Regarding the perceived descent of America into totalitarianism, McAfee notes that it’s been going on for some time, but that an acceleration is happening. He cites the U.S. constitution. “The interpretation of the constitution has gone insane. I mean, in the constitution we have certain rights — the right to public assembly, for example — that’s a right, not a privilege,” he then elaborates:

And yet, try going to any city in America. A couple hundred people. Assemble in the park and you know, do a thing. They’re gonna come and say ‘where’s your permit?’ Permit? If you have to have permission to exercise a right, then it’s not a right, people. It’s a privilege.

“[This interpretation] requires two classes of citizens: those with no rights, and those who have the right to hand out privileges … And the second class, those that have the right to give permission or to grant privilege also have the ‘right’ to grant themselves permissions and privileges.”

The cyber security expert then reiterates that the privileged class controls this paradigm and relies on methods of funding that are unconstitutional and illegal. He tells news.Bitcoin.com that America was the “industrial power of the world” even prior to the institution of the income tax in 1913.

“That’s why the government is now after me. I mean I haven’t paid taxes for 10 years, eight of which the government ignored me. I’ve already paid over $50 million in taxes in my lifetime. I have not received $50 million in services. If anything I should be the one asking for a f*cking refund.” McAfee continues:

Income taxes in my mind and heart, as I see the reality around us, are unconstitutional, illegal, and it pushed us back into a feudal society of over 1,000 years ago. Because what is a feudal society? One in which you belong to the king.

He suggests that other, more voluntary methods of taxation are too troublesome for the state, and would require effort on the government’s part. The lazy solution is simply to make everyone a slave to the king via income tax, forced to do the reporting themselves. A tax which is increasingly spent on draconian spying and surveillance.

“90% of all the surveillance budget for all the covert programs goes to watching … American citizens,” McAfee details. “This is where we’re spending our money. We are paying to watch ourself. We are paying to suspect ourself as being the enemy.” He remarks sardonically:

“We don’t trust you people. You might be a terrorist. You might be some insidious sub-human with an idea that will throw a monkey wrench into our perfect system of graft, bribery and corruption.”

2020 Crypto Campaign

McAfee has himself stated he’s not running to win the United States presidency. “If anybody believes I can win, stop taking the drugs, or get back on your medications, I’m not sure which … However, it doesn’t really matter who gets the presidency in my mind.” When news.Bitcoin.com asked what role crypto and cyber security play in his campaign, he stated:

The only reason I am campaigning is because of crypto. I think that the blockchain and privacy coins and distributed exchanges have the ability to free people from government control if people have the courage to do the right thing.

The right thing, as the rebel septuagenarian soon clarifies, is non-compliance. “When countries start, or when nations start creating their own cryptocurrencies like China, or companies like Facebook, those aren’t true cryptocurrencies. Those are crypto surveillance systems that allow governments and corporations to monitor every penny that you spend. And if we know that, and go well, f*ck me then I’m not gonna use them. Even if the government says you must use the crypto dollar, just say F you.”

“You can use a privacy coin like Monero and a distributed exchange, and then suddenly governments know nothing about your finances — how much you made, how much you spend — and therefore have to rely on your word for what you made and what you spend, with no way to audit that word. Now what do you think people are gonna do?”

McAfee’s Decentralized Exchange

Regarding his recently launched decentralized exchange, McAfee DEX, McAfee emphasizes: “I take no KYC, I don’t take any information from customers. No name, no email address, nothing. We hold no money, we hold no tokens. We’re just a hole between you and the blockchain and that hole makes it all look nice and neat. That’s what our portal does.”

“Our logic is on the blockchains, so it can’t be removed. If the SEC does catch up with me, my only word will be: ‘God, I’m sorry I wasn’t thinking, I didn’t know. But unfortunately it’s done now and I can’t change it. I can’t stop it.’ We charge nothing for listing a coin … we don’t charge maker fees. One quarter of one percent taker fees. That’s barely — even if we’re hot and everybody uses us — barely going to cover our development costs.” McAfee reiterates:

And yet, somebody had to do it, because if we don’t have exchanges like this then we’re dead in the water, people … You try shutting down a distributed, decentralized exchange — which mine is — it cannot be done. Technically, politically, legally, it can’t ever be taken down, and that’s my gift.

Whackd Coin and the Epstein Meme

McAfee chuckles heartily at the mention of his new WHACKD token, a crypto created to raise awareness about the suspicious death of convicted sex offender and billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. The maverick politician has also recently gotten the name of the coin tattooed on his arm, in case he is suicided by political powers. “Well, the tattoo is not a joke, I’ve got the tattoo here,” he reassures, “but the coin is a joke.”

“The fact that the government is even attempting to maintain the deception that [Epstein] hung himself is shocking. It is so obvious a man, six-foot-one, hanging himself from a five-foot-seven-inch bunk … You’re certainly not going to break your neck that way. ”

The coin, which McAfee hopes will help to unravel the already tenuous official government story, features a 10% burn every transaction (it’s “whacked”) and one in every 1,000 transactions is completely destroyed. “I made this coin … Just to keep it going,” he details. “If we push this, this will unwind something extremely important that we need to see. We need to see the truth of what happens behind that f*cking curtain … nobody believes he committed suicide.”

On Crypto Tribalism, Centralized Exchanges, and the Gift of Fire

McAfee says he’s got time for one more question and then he’s got to go. Asked about BTC maximalism and tribalist noise in the space, he relates that while he’s got nothing against Bitcoin (“I’m not dissing bitcoin at all. Who talks it up more than me?”), he does note weaknesses:

“Let us all get real, bitcoin maximalists … as a currency it is an ancient, creaky, impossible f*cking technology that has no privacy. That has no smart contracts.” McAfee goes on to imagine a bank behaving as the bitcoin blockchain, with account information publicly available to anyone who asks.

Non-KYC/AML, peer-to-peer platforms do exist, and enable private trading of cryptos forked from the BTC chain, like Bitcoin Cash, however, and the BCH blockchain is home to many privacy-focused developments and innovations. Still, the author concurs: mere hodling or trading of BTC on centralized exchanges is no revolution.

As McAfee emphasizes again, “That’s bitcoin, people. You know you will never f*cking use it if you have an alternative, and you have 11,000 f*cking alternatives now. The altcoin world.” He says that 95% of transactions are happening outside of centralized channels, for things like drugs, houses, bulletproof vests, pizza and shoelaces. He points to DAI, Monero, and Ethereum. He drives his point home: “You’ve gotta have control. That frees you … Free yourself first, then make your f*cking money. But stop this nonsense of trying to flip from this to that, waiting for the market to go up, day trading.”

You’re killing us, people. If you have those coins, buy something with it … Nothing you can’t buy with crypto if you search … You are wasting away the greatest gift that humanity has been given since fire.

Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 2387, created in mid-November, would tentatively schedule a Jan. 6 hard fork to delay the “difficulty bomb” or “Ice Age” from going off for another 4,000,000 blocks or about 611 days. The hard fork is dubbed “Muir Glacier,” after the retreating Alaskan glacier.

Slated for block number 9,069,000, the hard fork contains a bridge between the current chain, based on a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, and the Beacon Chain, or the first phase of the so-called Eth 2.0 transition to PoS.

With other networks like EOS, Binance Chain and Substrate looking to pick off projects from ethereum, developers voiced concerns on a call last Friday over maintaining the current chain’s health as the transition to Eth 2.0 occurs. Complicating matters, the network’s next major hard fork, Istanbul, is now slated for Saturday.

If developers fail to agree on Muir Glacier soon, which remains unlikely after reaching rough consensus on a developer call last week, block times will continue to move upwards, restricting the current network’s capabilities as transaction fees crowd out users.

The difficulty bomb, explained

A piece of code embedded in 2015, the difficulty bomb is one of two components which gradually increases the hashing difficulty on the ethereum blockchain, meant to force the network towards PoS with the Serenity network overhaul, currently slated for 2021.

Similar to bitcoin, ethereum features a mining difficulty adjustment scheme to control the output of ether rewards for mining on the network, of which the bomb is a part of.

Unlike bitcoin, ethereum’s difficulty bomb increases the time it takes to mine a block – typically between 10 and 20 seconds – every 100,000 blocks. Since the difficulty bomb is based on when blocks are mined, knowing when the network will feel the effects is more art than science.

EIP 2387 would be the third time since 2015 the bomb’s fuse has been extended, first by 3 million blocks in the 2018 Byzantium hard fork and then by another 2 million blocks in the February 2019 Constantinople hard fork.

Source: TrueBlocks, LLC

High settlement times are not alien to ethereum. As data provider Etherscan shows, block times soared before both the Byzantium and Constantinople hard forks, hitting over 30 and 20 seconds, respectively.

“It looks like given faster block times since Constantinople, it was a bit underestimated on when [high transaction fees] would hit again,” ethereum developer Eric Conner said in a private message. “People were under the assumption we had until the next fork after Istanbul, but actually it’s slowly kicking in now.”

In light of the earlier-than-expected uptick, Conner drafted EIP 2384, the Istanbul/Berlin Difficulty Bomb Delay, included in EIP 2387. In a little over six weeks, block times have increased from 13.1 to 14.3 seconds, Conner said. And, as the difficulty bomb is an exponential feature of ethereum, a one-second change has large implications down the road.

Keeping up with the network

Although an original feature of ethereum, some developers have called for getting rid of the difficulty bomb altogether. After all, it has been punted every time it becomes inconvenient.

Some see the logic in maintaining the original design, however. It does force ethereum clients to keep up to date with the network or face increasing costs to run on the network.

“The strongest argument for keeping some kind of expiry is to ensure that there is no option for ‘do nothing,’” ethereum developer Micah Zoltu said in a private message.

“The issue is more around stakeholders just simply no longer paying attention and not upgrading their clients,” he said. “The bomb is about ensuring people have to make a conscious decision to fork in the face of regular network upgrades.”

For now, EIP 2384 currently stands on last call for comment among ethereum developers. EIP 2387 reached rough consensus in last Friday’s call, but awaits both finalization of EIP 2384 and acceptance by ethereum clients such as Parity or Geth before network implementation.",2019-12-03 19:25:04+00:00,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/03/south-africa-central-bank-cryptocurrency-rules-bitcoin-regulation/,"The central bank of South Africa is looking to introduce new rules to govern the use of cryptocurrency and digital currency in the country.

According to South African financial newspaper Business Report, the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) is readying itself to deploy the new rules early next year.

SARB deputy governor Kuben Naidoo reportedly told the press last week that the rules bring the 5-year-long consultation period on the topic of digital assets to an end.

The bank is reportedly taking action to prevent cryptocurrency from being used to evade currency controls. The new regulations would place limits on how much local currency could be sent outside the country.

Presently, cryptocurrencies are not governed by these limits. The new regulations would see that they are.

It should be noted that smaller local banks have already been tightening their grip on cryptocurrencies in the country.

For example, Business Report says that at First National Bank (FNB) — one of South Africa’s “big five” banks — the accounts of all companies dealing in cryptocurrencies have been shut down.

In a statement, FNB said it took the course of action following a review of the risks associated with companies that handle cryptocurrency.

A South African digital asset exchange was affected by FNB‘s move to deny the company banking services.

It’s yet again an ironic turn of events that the cryptocurrency industry has, in certain situations, come to rely on traditional banking.

In some countries though, like Switzerland, regulations have sought to encourage banks and cryptocurrency businesses to play nice.

For most of the year, bitcoin’s price showed a modestly negative correlation with the S&P 500. In other words, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization tended to rise on days when the bellwether stock-market index fell, and vice versa.

But since early October, that relationship has weakened, according to information provided by Digital Assets Data.

The correlation, once well into the negative 20-30 range, is now beginning to flatten towards a reading of around negative 10 percent, as shown in the chart below.

The closer to zero or a positive correlation with the stock market that bitcoin gets, the harder it is to paint the digital asset as a port in the storm.

“The negative correlation has supported the store of value/digital gold thesis for BTC as investors may have been moving into the asset as a hedge against global economic turmoil,” said Kevin Kaltenbacher, Data Scientist of Digital Assets Data. “These recent developments potentially present some challenges to that narrative.”

A major critic of the co-variance argument, Alex Kruger, a macro cryptocurrency analyst, took to Twitter to offer his sarcastic take, referring to both the stock and foreign exchange markets and their relationship with bitcoin.

“Now that the ‘Stocks drive bitcoin higher’ meme has been proven wrong once again, this is a good time for the ‘CNH [Chinese Yuan Offshore] hedging drives bitcoin higher’ meme to make it back to the stage,” Kruger said.

Bitcoin still up on the year

Safe haven or not, bitcoin’s price remains significantly up since the year began.

Early Wednesday UTC time, it was up 94 percent up from the price of $3,689 witnessed Jan. 1, CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index shows.

At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands for $7,140 and is down 48.5 percent from its 2019 high at $13,880, witnessed June 26.

So even if bitcoin may not qualify as digital gold, long-term holders have nothing to fear from the price volatility bitcoin is currently experiencing, said Eddie Alfred, co-founder of Digitial Assets Data.

This period is an anomaly, he said.

“Observing 29-day periods since the genesis of bitcoin, we have seen 195 days where BTC has been down 25 percent or more from its recent high. That means the market has faced similar conditions on about 5 percent of days in BTC’s history,” Alfred said.",2019-12-04 09:00:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/4-billion-us-fintech-startup-sofi-receives-new-york-bitlicense/,"$4 Billion US Fintech Startup Sofi Receives New York Bitlicense

In September it has added crypto trading to its investing platform as a response to demand from its over 800,000 members, a service it can now offer it’s New York customers thanks to a new local Bitlicense.

Sofi Receives New York Bitlicense

It was announced on Tuesday that the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) has approved the application of Sofi Digital Assets, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Social Finance, Inc., for virtual currency and money transmitter licenses. The two licenses will allow Sofi to offer its New York clients the ability to buy and sell digital assets. The company now is authorized to support the cryptocurrencies bitcoin core (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH), ether classic (ETC), litecoin (LTC), and stellar lumens (XLM).

“Putting our members’ interests first is our top priority at Sofi,” said Anthony Noto, the CEO of the company. “That includes both offering individuals the products they want, like cryptocurrency within Sofi Invest, as well as protecting them, through a solid regulatory framework like that created by the New York State Department of Financial Services. We’re thrilled to now be able to offer the trading of cryptocurrency, in addition to active and automated investing, as part of Sofi Invest in New York State, in addition to the full suite of Sofi products that help our members borrow, save, spend, invest, and protect their money.”

A New York Bitlicense is considered one of the hardest in the world for companies to receive. This greatly limits the ability of local residences to engage with unlicensed ventures as only companies that can withstand the long and costly procedure even apply. Since 2015, DFS has granted only 24 virtual currency licenses or trust charters, including the last one given to Sofi on Tuesday.

“DFS is committed to fostering innovation in New York’s vibrant virtual currency sector and ensuring its competitiveness as a market for new entrants,” said Financial Services Superintendent Linda A. Lacewell. “The Department’s approval of Sofi’s virtual currency and money transmitter licenses provides consumers with more choices in a continuously evolving global financial services marketplace.”

$4 Billion Online Finance Startup

Sofi is a San Francisco-based fintech company founded in August 2011 and already valued at about $4.3 billion as of earlier this year. Its offering is focusing on providing millennials with student loan refinancing, personal loans, mortgages, and other wealth management and financial services. Sofi raised capital funding to a total of $2.3 billion with help from major investors such as the Japanese conglomerate Softbank and the Qatar Investment Authority.

In February 2019, it was reported that Sofi was planning to enter the crypto-assets market by enabling its users to follow and buy coins via a partnership with the U.S. exchange Coinbase. In September the company announced that it has added crypto trading to its fast-growing Sofi Invest platform, as a response to demand from its over 800,000 members. Sofi Invest now offers automated and active investing with stocks, ETFs, and crypto through a single app.

“Feedback from our members has made it clear that a significant percentage are not only interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies but are also already buying and selling crypto,” said at the time Sofi CEO Anthony Noto. “We’re very pleased to be adding this new product to Sofi Invest, as access, education, and keeping costs low for our members is at the heart of what we do.”

In a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Dec. 4, the former Morgan Stanley developers claim the platform is ten times faster than traditional crypto trading platforms, while offering 100x leverage to both retail and institutional investors in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) perpetual contracts.

Exchange is “on par with Nasdaq”

In the near future, these contracts will reportedly also be backed by traditional financial products, such as stock indexes, interest rates, foreign exchange, agricultural commodities, and metals and energy. Phemex co-founder Jack Tao said:

“We are the first exchange to truly bring Wall Street level sophistication to the worldwide crypto derivatives markets. Our matching engine, trading engine, and risk engine were six months in the making, putting the platform technically on par with Nasdaq.”

Tao, who spent 11 years as an executive at Morgan Stanley, told Cointelegraph that the platform was looking to add options trading soon. In launching Phemex, Tao assembled a team of more than 30 senior developers. He explained:

“We’re not just providing the functionality for trading. As executives from Morgan Stanley, we know what kind of ways, what kind of direction, or what kind of architecture can support high-frequency trading, stability, and low latency. This is where Phemex excels — our expertise allows us to compete with and outperform existing platforms.”

Tao told Cointelegraph that since the Nov. 25 launch, Phemex has seen volume of around 1000 BTC per day on BTC/USD contracts.

Singapore regulators take a closer look at crypto derivatives

In November, Singapore's central bank and financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), proposed to bring crypto derivatives trading under its purview. The MAS’ proposal would make the trading of derivatives based on underlying assets like Bitcoin and Ether subject to the city-state’s Securities and Futures Act. For Phemex, a Singapore-domiciled company, the proposal by the MAS comes at a perfect time as it may soon allow cryptocurrency-based derivatives to be traded on regulated platforms.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kazakhstan-wont-tax-cryptocurrency-mining-report,"Kazakhstan’s lawmakers won’t be taxing cryptocurrency mining until the mined crypto is exchanged for fiat money. According to a legislative analyst at a local blockchain association, cryptocurrency mining will not be treated as entrepreneurial activity but rather a “purely technological process,” local business publication Kursiv reports Dec. 4.

Madi Saken, legislative analyst at the National Association for the Development of the Blockchain and the Industry of Data Centers of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NABDC), reportedly announced the news at a local blockchain event “Blockchain Day” on Dec. 4, news which Saken has confirmed in an email to Cointelegraph.

Tax liabilities only apply to income in “real money”

According to the report, Kazakhstan's lawmakers have finalized a draft law on crypto taxation. The bill is currently under consideration with the presidential administration. The bill will reportedly be sent to the Mazhilis, the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of Kazakhstan, in December 2019.

Specifically, the proposed law will establish the legal status of crypto mining as well as rules for its taxation. According to Saken, digital assets and cryptos won’t be considered as subject to taxation because tax liabilities only apply to the income made in “real money.” As such, taxes will only be applicable when cryptocurrency is exchanged for fiat money. Saken elaborated:

“Tax liabilities only emerge when there is an income in the form of real money, particularly when a cryptocurrency is exchanged for real money, which means it is sold on an exchange. Then, this income in the form of classic money will be subject to taxation.”

Mining farms would be taxed by analogy with data centers

However, crypto mining will still be deemed entrepreneurial activity in cases when entities offer services to use their crypto mining hardware, the executive reportedly stated. Mining farms would reportedly be taxed by analogy with typical data centers, the report notes.

Kazakhstan’s government has taken a positive stance towards crypto and blockchain so far.

In 2018, the governor of Kazakhstan’s main financial hub, the Astana International Financial Center (AIFC), claimed that crypto and blockchain innovation will be supported despite the need to regulate cryptocurrencies. In May 2019, the AIFC partnered with blockchain tech giant Bitfury to cooperate on blockchain applications across a number of industries.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-exchanges-are-fighting-to-escape-binances-shadow/,"Cryptocurrency Exchanges Are Fighting to Escape Binance’s Shadow

It’s impossible to assess the cryptocurrency landscape without considering Binance. It looms large over the industry, dictating trends, soaking up liquidity, and compelling new exchanges to fight tooth and nail for market share. Most exchanges aren’t gunning to become the next Binance. But they must all exist in its shadow while striving to carve a niche of their own.

Also read: New List Claims 1.9 Million Bitcoin Held by Centralized Exchanges

Binance Is a Giant That Won’t Stop Growing

This week, a new exchange ranking system revealed that 1.9 million BTC worth around $14 billion is stored on centralized exchanges. A good chunk of that resides with Binance, where 2.5 million trades are conducted daily. Earlier this year Binance made headlines when it moved $1.3 billion of BTC in a single transaction. Its spot exchange dwarfs the competition, though its futures exchange which launched in September still lags behind the market leaders.

Barely a day seems to go by without Binance rolling out a new product or feature. This week, for instance, it announced zero-fee tezos staking. The move was seen as a direct challenge to custodians such as Coinbase, which charges 25%, and Gate.io which charges 33%. “Staking will become a user acquisition service similar to what Coinbase Earn is doing,” ventured The Block’s Larry Cermak. “Exchanges will eat the costs to attract new customers.”

New Exchanges Are Having to Get Creative

New exchanges looking to lure customers from giants such as Binance, Coinbase, and Huobi face a dilemma: should they emulate the formula that’s worked so well for Binance, or chart a different path and pray their boldness pays off?

Stormgain is a new crypto exchange that finds itself in this unenviable position. Its CEO Alex Althausen told news.Bitcoin.com that exchanges that replicate the status quo are setting themselves up to fail, saying: “The market doesn’t need another dozen Binance or Coinbase clones. There’s nothing wrong with introducing features that have proven to be successful elsewhere, but your exchange needs to have a USP that will enable it to make a name for itself.”

“With Stormgain, we’ve focused on giving traders tools that will empower them to make smarter decisions, and to ultimately increase their profitability. This includes things like free demo accounts to simulate trading, including the use of margin with up to 100x leverage, and trading signals for specific cryptocurrencies, which are directly integrated into the trading platform.”

Emirex is Dubai-headquartered Digital Commodities Exchange for trading tokenized commodities. Its co-founder Irina Heaver told news.Bitcoin.com that there is still room for emerging exchanges to prosper through focusing on the needs of regional investors. “There will always be a need for global exchanges,” she said, “but they will struggle to adapt to meet the needs of traders in specific jurisdictions. We’ve found through listening to the concerns of our customers that there’s a demand for services that cater to their technical ability, product familiarity, languages and fiat currency requirements.”

“Localization and understanding the uniqueness of the local markets is the key. From liaising with businesses in the Middle East, and fielding demand for tokenized representations of traditional assets such as commodities, for instance, we’ve been able to create a platform that’s tailor-made for that, and are now expanding into trading tokenized bonds and sharia compliant sukuks. This is something which international exchanges simply aren’t equipped to do.”

Has Binance Become Too Big to Fail?

Four days ago, Upbit became the seventh major exchange to be hacked this year when $50 million was drained from its ETH cold wallet. In May, Binance suffered a similar fate, losing $40 million of cryptocurrency. That was small change to the exchange, but given the amount of cryptocurrency it holds, including staking and lending assets, it remains a prime target for attackers. Binance has since tightened up its procedures, but if lightning were to strike twice and strike harder, the crypto market would react accordingly.

If you had to keep your #bitcoin on an exchange for a year, pick one. — sicarious (@Sicarious_) November 28, 2019

The ideal solution is for users to store more of their crypto in noncustodial wallets and for decentralized exchanges to improve to the point where they can compete with CEXs. For now, the best that can be hoped is for traders to avoid putting all their eggs in one basket. Smaller exchanges carry their own security trade-offs, naturally, and it will take time for newer entrants to build up trust and liquidity.

Of course, it’s easy to criticize the king. Centralization concerns aside, Binance is widely regarded as a net good for the cryptosphere, having improved the landscape in a wealth of ways. Nevertheless, bitcoiners have reason to remain wary of exchanges that become “too big to fail.” Years ago, another exchange held that mantle. Its name was Mt. Gox.

To put that in perspective, it’s almost as much as the daily trading volume of Bitfinex and Coinbase combined.

$313 Million Sent only for $1: Try That With Fiat

What is remarkable about this particular transaction – aside from the size – is that the fee to transfer that much Bitcoin was only $1. You can’t even buy a cup of decent coffee for $1 anymore, let alone transfer millions of dollars in fiat currency.

Now compare that to trying to wire fiat currency. Depending on the amount being transferred, you could pay thousands in ‘hidden’ fees on top of a transfer fee that is 10 – 20x greater – or more – than that of Bitcoin. For example, if you were to try to send $313,000 – 0.1% of the Bitcoin transaction – from the US to the UK using Transferwise, you would pay over $1200 in fees.

Possible Reasons Behind the Huge Transaction

The question on many people’s minds isn’t so much who withdrew such a huge amount of Bitcoin, but rather, why did the transaction take place?

Was Bittrex hacked?

Is there any relation to the recent Bitcoin price manipulation where the price spiked 8% just to retrace 10% hours after?

Did the whale decide not to dump his Bitcoins on the market? This, by the way, could be a bullish sign.

The consensus is that something is not quite right about the transaction. The receiving Bitcoin address is brand new, with only two transactions in its wallet history. That in and of itself isn’t all that odd, but as at least one Twitter user noted, there was no test transaction.

Isn’t it weird how there’s no test tx? @BittrexExchange would you like to confirm that funds are safe? — King (@KeengSchultz) December 4, 2019

You would think that with a transaction this size, that the user would send a small test transaction to verify that they entered the correct receiving address.

Other crypto Twitter users have speculated that the transaction is just Bittrex transferring bitcoins from its hot wallet to its cold wallet.

It's just an internal transfer. Bittrex moves #BTC from its exchange to its cold wallet. When their customers buy back #BTC, they will move coins back to exchange for liquidity — Nguyễn Duy Anh (@duyanh79) December 4, 2019

Recent data from BitUniverse shows that Bittrex has approximately 131,340 BTC in its reserves, meaning that if it was an internal transfer, then Bittrex just moved a third of its total BTC reserves into its cold wallet.

Requests asking Bittrex to confirm the legitimacy of the transaction have thus far gone unanswered.

Huge Bitcoin transactions are very rare, but even more rare are huge transactions to or from an exchange. In June 2019, a huge $101 million worth of Bitcoin was sent to Coinbase. In December 2018, a $257 was sent from an inactive address. Whale transactions are not limited to Bitcoin only: Last February, $100 million worth of Ethereum was delivered to Binance.

It appears they'll need to keep waiting a little longer, with nearly 70 cryptocurrency-focused hedge funds that mostly cater to pension funds, family offices and wealthy individuals closing this year, according to San Francisco-based Crypto Fund Research. The number of new funds launched is less than half the number started in 2018, the researcher said.

The retrenchment comes amid another volatile year for cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin and its peers once again posting the kind of swings that make institutional investors uncomfortable. While high-profile advocates such as Fidelity Investments and the New York Stock Exchange's parent company plow ahead with initiatives seeking to make it easier to own digital assets, the potential customer base seems to be disappearing at a quick clip.

""The market is definitely retail driven and will remain so for the foreseeable future,"" said Nic Carter, co-founder of Boston-based cryptocurrency market tracker Coin Metrics.

At the same time, one of the other projected lures for professional money managers — regulated futures — continue to be greeted with a muted response.

Trading volumes on bitcoin futures on exchanges like Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Bakkt, which began offering futures that settled in bitcoin in September, have increased, but are still relatively low. CME's daily volume this year averaged about 32,500 bitcoins, or $236.8 million at current prices, with more than 3,500 individual accounts trading, the company said in November.

That's just a drop in the bucket compared with the volume on less-regulated trading platforms outside the U.S. Aggregate Bitcoin futures volume — mostly on exchanges letting any retail speculator buy contracts with as much as 125 times more money than they put down — exceeds $10 billion a day, according to tracker Skew.com.

That hasn't stopped Fidelity from joining long-time cryptocurrency advocates such as Michael Novogratz and the Winklevoss brothers from building out services such as custodial storage to make institutional investors more comfortable owning digital assets. Fidelity said recently that growth is exceeding internal expectations without providing specifics.

""It's not a stampede by any stretch, but people are all doing their work,"" Mr. Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners LLC, said in a recent interview. ""The next wave will come from the wealth advisers, maybe with endowments and small foundations participating."" In November, Galaxy launched two new bitcoin funds for institutional investors.

Two public funds in Virginia's Fairfax County recently increased their exposure to the industry. Earlier this year, Harvard University's endowment backed Blockstack Inc., a cryptocurrency company. Institutional investments into cryptocurrencies are likely to increase over the next five years, according to a Fidelity survey earlier this year.

Regulatory scrutiny is to blame in large part for the hesitant steps, as governments try to stop rampant scams and companies like Facebook Inc. from usurping too much power. The resulting uncertainty, as well as cryptocurrencies' inherent volatility (bitcoin has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year, but is down by more than 40% since its peak in June) are likely to continue to give many investors pause.

""Taking a step back, I think some would argue that the levels of institutional adoption are disappointing or underwhelming but, of course, this view depends entirely on expectations,"" said Spencer Bogart, general partner at San Francisco-based Blockchain Capital LLC. ""To me, the fact that there is any institutional adoption for bitcoin only 10 years into existence is a radical success and beyond what anyone could have imagined just 3 or 4 years ago.""",2019-12-04 09:31:32-05:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/andreas-antonopoulos-slams-intuit-after-payments-block-for-crypto-use,"American financial software company Intuit has apparently limited the account of one of the cryptocurrency industry’s best-known figures, Andreas Antonopoulos.

In a series of tweets on Dec. 4, Antonopoulos stated that Intuit had prevented him from accepting credit card payments via its accounting services due to his use of cryptocurrency.

According to Antonopoulos, who undertakes regular international tours as a speaker and educator on Bitcoin (BTC) and associated topics, the company even requested he stop referencing cryptocurrency on his official website. Commenting on the events, he appeared to refuse to comply:

“Intuit Merchant Services @intuit just told me that I can't be using crypto if I accept credit cards for my invoices. They asked me to remove crypto from my site. I instead elected to remove Intuit and their credit card services from my life.”

Continuing, he added that Intuit had “disabled” the option for him to accept credit card payments for his activities.

Antonopoulos is a fierce critic of traditional finance, often explaining to audiences how banks stand to lose to Bitcoin and new standards of individual financial sovereignty. He tweeted today, “The banking cartel doesn't want competition or risk. They prefer monopolies, kleptocracy and captured regulators.”

Banks force Bitcoin bans

As Cointelegraph reported, certain payment entities continue to adopt a seemingly random policy on cryptocurrency clients. This week, a Danish court ruled in favor of Nordea Bank continuing to prevent its employees from holding cryptocurrency, triggering accusations of hypocrisy from online commentators.

Nordea’s stance echoes those previously adopted by other banks, including Dutch institution Rabobank. The latter denied service to cryptocurrency businesses, having faced criminal proceedings over fiat money laundering.

Last month, adult entertainment website Pornhub found payments to its 100,000 web models disrupted after PayPal suddenly refused to service the business. The website began a deal with cryptocurrency project Verge (XVG) last year.

In an ironic twist, U.S. lender Bank of America subsequently closed the account of a former senior PayPal executive.

It seems as if this year’s bearish crypto market isn’t scaring away institutional money. Expected to be one of the main factor’s pushing for a boom, reports indicate that business has been consistently growing in 2019. According to a senior executive at Grayscale, a cryptocurrency asset management giant, 2019’s second quarter alone saw $85 million come from investors — twice as much as the first quarter.

There have been increasing reports that this trend has continued and increased as the end of the year approaches. As proof, we have Bakkt’s volume – it started slow, but it has been breaking records lately. Let’s have a look.

Bakkt launches institutional crypto custody services

Bakkt finally launched Bitcoin futures trading this year, but it’s this month’s development that Bakkt sees as the critical factor for institutional adoption of Bitcoin. On November 12, Bakkt opened the Bakkt Warehouse to offer its bitcoin custody service to institutions around the globe, not just Bakkt Bitcoin Futures Clients.

Adam White, COO of Bakkt, said:

“A critical link — perhaps the critical link — in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin is custody. When investors have ready access to regulated custodians whose security and processes they trust, the full potential of this emerging asset class and technology can flourish.”

To so broadly open Bitcoin custody services, Bakkt needed the approval of the New York Department of Financial Services, which it duly obtained.

White says Bakkt Warehouse has already welcomed a number of VC and blockchain investors including Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Tagomi.

Evidence of institutional interest

On November 8, Bakkt Bitcoin Futures contracts hit a new daily record of 1,756 events and then again on November 22, with 2,468 futures contracts traded.

The latest reports say that despite Bitcoin’s price fall and a Billion “long contracts” being liquidated on BitMEX, Bitcoin futures trading is seeing spikes. Both CME Group and Bakkt have reported increases in trading volume in the last couple of weeks. On Friday, Nov 22, Bakkt saw an all-time high of $20.3 million in monthly futures contracts, up 66% from its previous high.

The trend has maintained an upward curve. According to a Twitter post this Monday, December 3, by Bakkt Volume Bot, the open interest on Bakkt Bitcoin futures reached a new all-time high of $6.5 million.

In futures markets, “open interest” is the number of open contracts in the market. It is often used to indicate the market’s health. So when there is a large amount of “open interest”, that means that new or additional capital is flowing in.

Institutional money also appears to be flowing into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Not only did they report a doubling of investment from the first quarter of 2019 to the second quarter, of which 80% came from institutional investment, their third quarter was also impressive. Grayscale reported a record $171 million inflow with a single day’s investment seeing $75 million worth of shares bought.

Speaking about the factors fuelling institutional growth, Kari S. Larsen, a partner at Perkins Coie’s Blockchain Technology & Digital Currency Group, said:

“Exchanges are changing their focus from retail traders to institutional traders, providing such customers better ability to customize the front end of their trading platforms and providing APIs that better suit what institutional traders are used to.”

Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, CEO of financial services group BCB, also said at the time:

“2019’s growth belongs to financial institutions who are diversifying stale portfolios and finally have the professional machinery to do so.”

By the middle of this year, BCB had onboarded just under 32 financial institutions for banking and OTC trading, as per CoinDesk. The CEO added:

“This is a fundamental shift in client profile compared to last year, which was dominated by crypto projects looking for liquidity.”

Predictions for 2020

A Fidelity survey this year of institutional investors found 47% had an “overwhelmingly favourable” opinion of cryptocurrencies. As per the study and CoinTelegraph:

“Institutional investors are finding appeal in digital assets, and many are looking to invest more in digital assets over the next five years.”

Experts expect more institutional investment in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2020, but retail investors could be more likely to favour Bitcoin alternatives and take their pick of the broader cryptocurrency markets.

Cryptocurrency analyst and ex-Wall Street trader, Tone Vays, told Crypto News, “I do see more family offices looking to buy Bitcoin for the longer term.” But, he adds, “institutional investors should and will mostly only be attracted to Bitcoin.”

Optimism is rife for Bitcoin still, Snapchat investor Jeremy Liew and Blockchain founder Peter Smith penned a report that puts the price of bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of the next decade.

Other developments in cryptocurrency and blockchain may drive further institutional investment, particularly Facebook’s Libra project. Though it is firing up regulators, it is also creating further discussion in central banks over the prospect of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), a development no institutional investor could ignore.

What 2020 may see is the consolidation the cryptocurrency markets need. Some retail investors and whales may exit, but institutional investors will continue to enter the market at pace. This may diversify the market enough to prevent some of the more volatile swings. The balance of entrants versus exits will be what determines whether 2020 delivers the next cryptocurrency boom and whether bitcoin will hit some of the more conservative predicted highs.",2019-12-05 00:00:00.000,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-focused-lender-blockfi-launches-trading-platform/,"Blockfi Launches Crypto Trading Platform

Crypto financial services company Blockfi has launched a trading platform supporting three cryptocurrencies. The new offering adds to the company’s existing services: interest-bearing accounts and crypto-backed loans. Blockfi has completed registration with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and expanded its state licenses to cover both lending and money transmission.

Trading Platform Launch

Blockfi announced Thursday the launch of its crypto trading platform for individual and institutional investors. “Blockfi Trading will initially allow holders of cryptocurrencies to seamlessly trade between bitcoin, ether and the Gemini dollar (GUSD) within the Blockfi platform, subject to geographic availability,” the New Jersey-based company explained. CEO Zac Prince commented, “To date, we have focused on providing products to existing crypto investors that are readily available to investors in other asset classes,” elaborating:

With the launch of trading, we are taking a big step in the direction of enabling net new investors to come into the ecosystem.

“Growth of the crypto market overall benefits the entire industry and we’re excited to shift our focus in that direction,” the CEO opined. According to the announcement, trades are fee-free and executed immediately based on current market prices. “Blockfi aggregates liquidity to offer seamless trade execution and pricing. The rates displayed when you place a trade reflect the price you will pay with no additional fees,” the company clarified. Fiat support will be added at a later date. In addition, USDC and litecoin are expected to be supported in early January.

In preparing to launch the trading platform, Blockfi completed registration as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury. The company also expanded its “state licensing strategy to include money transmission licenses in addition to its existing state lending licenses,” Thursday’s announcement reveals. Blockfi services customers worldwide, including 47 U.S. states. In April, the company began offering its flagship product, the Blockfi Interest Account (BIA), to retail and institutional investors in India.

Blockfi has backing from investors such as Galaxy Digital, Susquehanna, Akuna Capital, Fidelity, Recruit Strategic Partners, Consensys Ventures, Sofi, Coinbase Ventures, CMT Digital, and Morgan Creek Digital.

Interest-Bearing Accounts and Crypto-Backed Loans

Prior to launching the trading platform, the company has two key products: the Blockfi Interest Account and U.S. dollar loans secured with crypto. Clients’ cryptocurrencies are deposited into a custodial account at Gemini, a trust company regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services. “Blockfi pays interest rates up to 8.6% for balances held in BIA and an ability to borrow via loans at rates as low as 4.5%,” the company’s website describes.

The Blockfi Interest Account lets customers earn compound interest on their BTC, ETH, and GUSD with no minimum balance required. Interest is compounded monthly and paid at the beginning of every month. The annual percentage yield (APY) for 0-10 BTC is 6.2%, which reduces to 2.2% for amounts greater than 10 BTC. For ETH, the APY is 4.1% for 0-1,000 ETH and 0.5% for amounts over 1,000 ETH. For GUSD, the APY is 8.6%. Blockfi allows customers to choose the currency of their interest payments through its product called Interest Payment Flex. For those wanting to earn interest on their BCH, Bitcoin.com has partnered with financial services platform Cred to offer up to 10% interest on BCH and BTC holdings.

For crypto-backed loans, Blockfi’s customers can use BTC, ETH, or LTC as collateral and borrow up to 50% of the asset value in USD for 12 months. The starting interest rate is 4.5%. For example, 7.05 BTC is needed as collateral for a loan amount of $25,000. Loans are funded in USD, GUSD, or USDC directly into clients’ bank accounts or wallets. Customers can make monthly interest-only payments in dollars or cryptocurrency.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin's technical and fundamental factors are building up towards the halving season of 2020.

Despite growing momentum, Bitcoin's price action was rejected sharply at the $7,800 resistance, back to the $7,400 support.

Investment thesis

I believe Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has reached its bottom at $6,500 following the recent market correction of +50% from its 2019 high. Considering the consolidation of technical factors and growing investor sentiment, I believe Bitcoin at sub-$8,000 may be considered a ""discount"", thus a good time to start buying in.

Cryptocurrency markets are rebounding from support levels after the recent market rout. On November 29th, Bitcoin touched the $7,800 resistance, before being rejected sharply. Currently Bitcoin is floating near or below its previous resistance (now turned support), at $7,400.

Bitcoin's drop to $6,500 may have signaled the bottom, as the strong rebound may indicate the beginning to a long-term bullish outlook.

Going up

1) On of the key points to consider is the CME Bitcoin Futures gap, a phenomenon where there is a price difference between the trading sessions in the futures market (which is more apparent for cryptocurrencies, as they trade non-stop, unlike traditional securities).

Historically, Bitcoin has almost always filled that price gap eventually, either going up or down in to meet it.

Source: TradingView, CME Group (Zack Norman)

The recent market correction occurred near the weekends, as futures closed while Bitcoin corrected to a 6-month low of $6,500. Taking a closer look at the inverse heads and shoulders patterns, there were 3 futures gaps that had been filled.

On December 4th, there was a pump and dump cycle which allowed Bitcoin to fill the futures gap caused by the strong rejection earlier, at the $7,800 resistance. However, Bitcoin soon revisited the $7,400 support once more.

There is one more gap that remained unfilled which could signal an upwards move soon, around the $8,200 resistance. Optionally, we would still need a clean and steady break above $7,800 to mark a confident bullish move.

2) Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing a strong consolidation of technical factors:

A compilation of indicators. Note, the MACD is showing a bit of green, and a bullish crossover of the signal lines. The Squeeze Momentum indicator is also reinforcing the possibility of an upwards momentum soon.

An inverse Head & Shoulders pattern showing a potential trend reversal.

However, some of the technical indicators are flashing potential bearish signs ahead. After the recent rejection, the short-term 50 EMA crossed below the long-term 200 EMA on the 1H chart, thus a trend reversal is needed soon to change this.

3) During Bitcoin's massive correction, we're seeing large accumulation by institutions, as it can be shown with record volumes on Bakkt's Bitcoin Futures. At that period, on November 27th, Bakkt's trading volume surged +148% to $42.52 million, as open interest rose 6% to $4.16 million.

Moreover, Fidelity will soon launch a custodian and trading solutions for Bitcoin, under Fidelity Digital Assets; and Square marking a 244% YoY increase in Bitcoin-related transactions with a doubling of first-time Bitcoin buyers. Institutions are proving to become more comfortable with Bitcoin, and as they begin to accumulate more, retail investors and traders will feel more confident with a more maturing market.

Key factors towards end-2019

Conclusively, considering the mixed technical factors, there are possibilities for continued volatility in the short-term, as Bitcoin continues to hover around or below its current support at $7,400.

Nevertheless, I do firmly believe that at current prices firmly below $8,000, Bitcoin presents a good buy opportunity, as we've bounced sharply from its low of $6,500 after the recent +50% market correction. Here is a list of things to look out for as we start the end of 2019:

1) A clean break above $7,800 is needed to confidently mark an upwards trend, leading into $8,200 at its next resistance point.

2) Bakkt will soon launch its physically-settled Bitcoin Futures contracts on ICE Singapore on December 9th. Historically, Bitcoin plunged down to $8,000 USD/BTC soon after Bakkt's launch in the U.S. back in October. However, with currently growing institutional demand, and following reports of increased Bitcoin trading in Malaysia and Singapore, Bakkt's Singapore launch could boost Bitcoin prices further.

3) As per my previous post, any news concerning government crackdowns on cryptocurrency and Blockchain related projects in China could weaken Bitcoin prices in the future, possibly pushing it back to low or sub-$7,000 with current prices. Thus far, China has never taken excessive action against cryptocurrencies, yet overreaction from traders/investors could exacerbate the situation.

4) Another point from my previous post, we need to look out for market liquidity in the cryptocurrency markets.

To address one of the points I made then, it would seem that any miner capitulation might not be significant enough (presently) to have an effect on Bitcoin prices, as we are seeing increasing hash rate, mining revenue, and balanced mining difficulty (thus squeezing supply further).

Laundering money through bitcoin is a bad idea—not only because it’s illegal, but also because it leaves a permanent trail. Defendants have repeatedly been undone because they’ve relied on the cryptocurrency for some part of their nefarious activities. Sometimes, they’ve been arrested years after their alleged crimes.

According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, it’s estimated that 2% to 5% of the global GDP—or $800 billion to $2 trillion—is laundered each year, much of it in cash. But over the last few years, with cryptocurrencies growing in prominence and price, they’ve become a popular option, too. Government agencies have started contracting crypto-analytics firms like Chainalysis and CipherTrace to track down money launderers and other criminals.

“Cryptocurrencies have the reputation for being cross-border and anonymous, and therefore attractive to bad actors across the world,” Kim Grauer, senior economist for Chainalysis, explained to Quartz over email. “But because transactions involving cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are recorded on a permanent, public, and immutable ledger, cryptocurrencies can actually offer unprecedented transparency into financial transactions.”

Laundering money through bitcoin is like pulling off a jewelry heist, but leaving a map to your apartment at the scene of the crime. You can shred the map into tiny pieces—by sending bitcoin through multiple wallet addresses, or accounts, to hide your tracks—but with sufficient time and data-crunching power, it’s possible for other people to reassemble the clues.

What cryptocurrencies save in time (versus say, buying and selling bars of gold) they lose in efficacy. When it comes to financial crime, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether, are blunt instruments.

“The goal of money laundering is to create a chain of transactions that can’t be traced, so since the bitcoin blockchain is designed to have an indelible public record of all transactions, it makes ‘laundering’ much more difficult,” Dave Weisberger, CEO of CoinRoutes, a crypto order-routing service, said. “The technology from [blockchain analytics] firms such as Elliptic and Chainanalysis is sophisticated as well. They can trace [wallet] addresses quite well, which also make law enforcement easier.”

That’s part of why the arrest of a crypto expert last week is confounding. Virgil Griffith, a special projects researcher for the Ethereum Foundation, was detained last week in Los Angeles. The US accuses him of traveling to North Korea earlier this year “in order [to] deliver a presentation and technical advice on using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions.”

Regardless of whether Griffith is innocent or guilty, what he’s accused of is, well, dumb. Is it possible to launder money and evade US sanctions using cryptocurrencies? Yes. Is it advisable, or even practical? Hell no. Crypto’s limited trading volumes, traceability, and storage risk affect everybody.

Reuters additionally reported that Griffith may have planned to send mining equipment to North Korea, ostensibly so the government or others could generate their own ether. Apparently he called the idea “cool.” But again—regardless of whether a crime was committed—it’s laughably unrealistic at scale, and anybody who got within 100 miles of North Korean bitcoin would put themselves on the blockchain (and watchlists) forever.

You must study the endgame before everything else.",,https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/irs-criminal-investigation-expects-to-hire-more-agents-pursue-more-cryptocurrency-cases-in-coming-year,"The Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation division identified $1.8 billion in tax fraud in 2019, with a 91.2 percent conviction rate for all financial crimes, according to the division’s 100th annual report released Thursday, which also highlighted a continued focus on employment tax, cryptocurrency and cybercrime.

This year’s report, which marked the agency's 100th anniversary, continued a general downward trend of investigations and prosecutions for CI over the last few years. In a conference call with reporters, CI chief Don Fort attributed the trend to fewer special agents, as many retire and those who remain in service devote time to inheriting those cases and training new agents. Fort estimated that 130 to 150 agents retire every year, and that the time between onboarding new agents and completion of their first case averages two to three years.

The overall number of CI investigations initiated in 2019 was 2,485, down from 2,886 in 2018 and 3,019 in 2017. Meanwhile, $4.4 billion in proceeds from other (non-tax fraud) financial crimes were identified in 2019, 1,726 warrants were executed, and 1.24 petabytes of digital data were seized.

“We are in a hiring posture now,” Fort explained. “I’m very hopeful we’ve reached the bottom in terms of staffing. We end the year with 2,000 special agents, which puts us at 1970s levels.” Fort expects to onboard more in-depth special agents over the next year. “I’m really excited about that, and hopeful it’s not a one-time event. We have the support for a number of years of robust hiring, to get the numbers back up.""

Overall, Fort characterized the past year, his third as chief, as “exciting times” as CI ramps up hiring, continues to take advantage of technology like data analytics, and collaborates with other agencies to combat newer threats related to cryptocurrency and cybercrime.

“We’ve had tremendous cases represented by every field office in every state; a lot of positive momentum there,” Fort said. “As we’ve been challenged in the manpower perspective for the last five to six years, we have used that time wisely. We’ve made investments in cyber, cyber investigations in tax and non-tax, working in data analytics with the Nationally Coordinated Investigations Unit [which became an official CI section this year]. The success we’ve seen there, we’ve invested wisely in the last few years. With the investment in those areas, we’re seeing the fruits of our labor.”

Another area of momentum for CI has been in employment tax enforcement, one of the few areas where the unit saw an upswing in investigations initiated (250), prosecution recommendations (104), informations/indictments (73), those sentenced (50) and the incarceration rate (84 percent), all an increase over 2018.

“In particular, employment tax, we made that a point of emphasis for CI and the IRS as a whole,” Fort said. “The time spent on employment tax has gone up considerably. There is a tremendous amount of noncompliance in that area. It’s a huge part of what funds the federal government. We’ve absolutely made that a point of emphasis. It’s the goal of field officers to work a balanced program area. All noncompliance tax threats in a particular area, as well as money laundering and bank secrecy threats. I can confirm employment tax will continue to be an area of emphasis for us.”

Abusive return preparer program enforcement also experienced some positive shifts in 2019. While the number of investigations in the category were down this year, at 163, the number of prosecution recommendations (203) and sentencings (154) were up slightly over last year, keeping the incarceration rate at a flat 78 percent.



In terms of collaboration with outside agencies, Fort identified the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, or J5, formed in 2018 among CI and its counterparts in four other countries to battle international tax evasion, as one recent success.

Other examples of interagency successes, though acknowledged by Fort to be more dated, were the shutdowns of darknet markets Silk Road and AlphaBay, in 2013 and 2017, respectively, “a great example of multi-agencies, under the Department of Justice, helping to solve crimes.”

“The most recent success in cryptocurrency was the Welcome to Video case, the child exploitation case,” Fort said, referring to what the DOJ called the “largest dark web child porn marketplace” when it took down the website in October. The use of bitcoin on the site led to CI’s involvement in tracking the cryptocurrency.

Fort anticipates that this kind of collaboration will continue in the years ahead.

“The next wave of crime, in front of our eyes, requires us to employ new ways of investigation in solving these crimes. The crimes are money- and greed-based, conducive to our work in following the money. We all have our own skills and capabilities. We have a lot of initiatives underway to partner with federal agencies and collaborate internationally.”

CI has also been partnering with academia to deepen its expertise in data analytics, working with universities and colleges that are utilizing the technology in innovative ways.

In the next year, Fort expects CI to help take down more dark web marketplaces and create more of a tax focus on cryptocurrency. Fort emphasized that CI currently has many open cases related to cryptocurrency and cybercrime that the agency hopes to make public by the end of this fiscal year.",2019-12-05 21:27:41.106,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/70-crypto-hedge-funds-shut-in-2019-with-low-institutional-demand/,"As many as 70 crypto-focused hedge funds closed down this year as institutional turn out to the sector remains on the lower side.

The report outlined that institutional attention on the sector was expected to soar with the introduction of the Bitcoin futures instrument by CME Group in 2017 and Bakkt this year. Though CME’s daily volume this year averaged about 32,500 Bitcoins or $236.8 million at current prices, the figure is relatively less compared to the numbers reported by the unregulated platforms overseas territories.

“It’s not a stampede by any stretch, but people are all doing their work,” said Mike Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Investment Partners LLC. “The next wave will come from the wealth advisers, maybe with endowments and small foundations participating.”

“Taking a step back, I think some would argue that the levels of institutional adoption are disappointing or underwhelming but, of course, this view depends entirely on expectations,” Spencer Bogart, general partner at Blockchain Capital LLC, told Bloomberg. “To me, the fact that there is any institutional adoption for Bitcoin only 10 years into existence is a radical success and beyond what anyone could have imagined just 3 or 4 years ago.”",2019-12-05 08:16:39+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/rbi-governor-discusses-crypto-and-central-bank-digital-currency/,"RBI Governor Discusses Crypto and Central Bank Digital Currency

The governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, spoke about cryptocurrency during a press conference on Thursday. He also talked about the prospect of an RBI-issued digital currency, when the time will be right for issuing one, and his view on private digital currencies.

RBI Governor’s View on Cryptocurrency

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reportedly talked about cryptocurrency and central bank digital currency (CBDC) on Thursday at a customary post-policy press conference. The governor “made it clear that the RBI is completely against private digital currency, asserting the sovereign’s right over this function,” PTI reported. Das was quoted as saying:

The world over, central banks and the governments are against private digital currency because currency issuance is a sovereign function and it has to be done by the sovereign.

The RBI has never been friendly to cryptocurrency. In April last year, the central bank banned financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses including exchanges, forcing some of them out of business. The ban went into effect three months later. A number of crypto industry stakeholders filed writ petitions with the supreme court challenging the ban but the case is still ongoing. The court is scheduled to resume hearing the case on Jan. 14, 2020.

Das’ statements also echo the bill drafted by the interministerial committee (IMC) tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrency and providing recommendations. The committee, headed by former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg, submitted the draft bill entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019” to the Ministry of Finance in February. After it was made public in July, Garg tweeted: “Private cryptocurrencies are of no real value. Rightly banned.”

When RBI Will Issue Digital Currency

Regarding whether the RBI is looking into issuing a central bank digital currency, Governor Das said on Thursday that “It is very early to speak on a central bank issuing digital currencies,” PTI further reported. “Some discussions are going on. Technology has not fully evolved yet. It is still in very incipient stage of discussions and at RBI we have examined it internally,” Das revealed, elaborating:

As and when the technology evolves with adequate safeguards, I think it is an area where the Reserve Bank will certainly look at seriously at an appropriate time.

The draft bill to ban cryptocurrency has a section on central bank digital currency and its proposed legal framework. The IMC is of the view that “it would be advisable to have an open mind regarding the introduction of an official digital currency in India,” its report reads.

The bill defines digital rupees as “a form of currency issued digitally by the Reserve Bank and approved by the central government to be legal tender.” The IMC has recommended that the government, “in consultation with the Central Board of the Reserve Bank, may approve [the] digital rupee to be legal tender with effect from such date and to such extent as may be specified.” In 2017, there were reports of the Indian government considering issuing state-run digital currency called Lakshmi.

The Indian government told the supreme court in August that it planned to introduce the aforementioned bill in the Winter session of parliament but it ended up not being on the agenda. Meanwhile, the crypto community in India strongly believes that the bill is flawed and has been campaigning to convince the government to reevaluate the bill and the IMC’s ban recommendations. In October, Das and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman answered some questions regarding cryptocurrency, stablecoins, and Facebook’s Libra at an IMF and World Bank meeting.

Jack Tao, who served as a senior leader at Morgan Stanley’s electronic trading desk, said he launched Phemex last month with a team of more than 30 developers, including eight executives from the investment banking giant.

Tao left his job at Morgan Stanley in New York and co-founded the crypto trading firm in Singapore in July, envisioning a platform that would be as fast and secure as stock and futures exchanges.

The budding firm has made some big promises.

“Phemex is ten times faster than traditional crypto trading platforms with the ability to manage 300,000 TPS – the fastest matching engine online,” said Tao, who specialized in high-frequency trading. No existing platform has achieved such transaction speeds, he said.

Phemex’s architecture can reduce latency so as to deliver an order entry and response time of less than one millisecond while maintaining stable APIs for algorithmic trading, according to Tao.

While crypto trading is fiercely competitive, Tao believes Phemex has a comparative advantage as a small platform.

“Big trading platforms such as CME [Chicago Mercantile Group] are very great platforms for traditional securities trading, but that’s also why they are relatively slow to adopt emerging technologies and trade digital assets,” Tao said.

Such platforms are more cautious about entering into new markets whereas startups tend to be more experimental with new frontiers, he said.

Phemex offers retail and institutional investors perpetual contracts for bitcoin, ethereum and XRP with up to 100 times leverage. These are similar to futures contracts, except they have no expiration date.

As the exchange gains traction, it plans to also offer contracts backed by traditional financial products, including stock indexes, interest rates and commodities, Tao said.

The bullish momentum is observed across all the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with just Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and Unus Sed Leo (LEO) seeing some losses at the time of writing.

Meanwhile, Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) are reporting the biggest gains among the top 20 over the past 24 hours, both up around 4%, according to Coin360.

After trading around $7,400 price point for the better part of the day, Bitcoin spiked to hit an intraday high of $7,576 in a matter of minutes. At the time of publication, the major cryptocurrency is up 1%, trading at $7,450.

Despite renewed upward movement, Bitcoin is still down over 3.5% on the past seven days as it failed to retest $7,800 on Nov. 30. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin is still down around 20% from $9,286.

The new spike in Bitcoin’s price comes alongside news that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission approved another Bitcoin derivatives fund. As reported by Cointelegraph, BTC futures-focused NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund is now allowed to offer its shares to institutional investors.

The upward movement on crypto markets may be caused by the approaching Christmas holidays, according to a new report from analysts at crypto exchange SFOX. According to the researchers, Bitcoin searches on Google usually peak before holidays, not after. As such, on Nov. 28 — Thanksgiving in the U.S. — Bitcoin saw three consecutive days of price growth, the firm stated.

Meanwhile, Twitter crypto personality Bitcoin Macro recently predicted that 2020 will be a “mind blowing year for crypto,” while “2019 was, and still is, the year to accumulate.”

Hidden among the lines of code in the first ever batch of the cryptocurrency was a headline from the frontpage of that day’s edition of The Times: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”.

It was 3 January, 2009, and the world was in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Banks were collapsing, businesses were foreclosing and people were losing their homes.

It was the result of the worst excesses and greed of a capitalistic system that was teetering on the edge of comprehensive collapsed. But Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, believed he had a solution.

It came in the form of a revolutionary “electronic cash system” that ditched centralised systems like banks and governments in favour of a peer-to-peer payments network supported by an online ledger known as a blockchain.

But for all its promise, it turned out to be a bumpy revolution. Nothing much actually happened for the first few years after bitcoin‘s birth, and it lay largely dormant until after the worst of the period’s economic turmoil had already passed.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the year Reuters

In the early 2010s it was only a core group of cypherpunks and cryptography enthusiasts that really understood bitcoin’s potential but its semi-anonymous nature meant it soon found use among drug dealers and cyber criminals on the dark web.

After a brief price surge in 2012 it began to gain more widespread recognition and by late 2017 it was making frontpage headlines of its own as its market capitalisation briefly exceed $300 billion – more than the entire GDP of over 140 countries.

Some warned at the time that the phenomenal price growth was the result of a bubble – and, sure enough, it eventually crashed. Throughout 2018 its value tumbled repeatedly – and sometimes spectacularly – as naysayers pronounced its death and late investors lost millions.

By the start of 2019, a bitcoin was worth less than $4,000 and excitement for the great economic experiment had subsided before any truly mass-market use cases had even been realised.

But it was far from over. As the decade draws to a close, news about new digital currency projects have begun to emerge – from vast multi-national corporations like Facebook, to some of the world’s biggest economies.

With each positive news story about cryptocurrency, the price of bitcoin has grown, yet the volatility remains. For some, this unpredictability is one of the reasons it can never achieve its potential as a mainstream form of currency.

Sceptics remain and misconceptions of bitcoin being some kind of “magic internet money” with no inherent worth continue to dominate stale narratives about cryptocurrency.

Some cryptocurrency advocates point to the fact that, on the contrary, it is traditional currencies that can be created out of thin air through processes like quantitative easing. And while established currencies are no longer backed by gold or anything tangible, bitcoin has the blockchain to mathematically regulate a finite supply.

Nigel Green, CEO of London-based financial advisory firm deVere Group, claims cryptocurrencies are redefining and reshaping the financial system and that critics are either ignoring, or simply not understanding, the promise they hold.

“I would suggest that most people saying these things do not understand the crypto sector as it is relatively young and/or have vested interests in older, traditional ones,” he tells The Independent. “However, whether they like it or not, dyed-in-the-wool financial traditionalists need to accept that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.”

What is cryptocurrency and the technology behind bitcoin and its rivals?

Bitcoin may have assured its place in history but its future remains uncertain. There have already been thousands of spin-offs – there are currently 2,364 different cryptocurrencies listed on monitoring site CoinMarketCap – and some believe one of these will soon take its place as the dominant cryptocurrency.

Some of the more notable ones, like ethereum, ripple and bitcoin cash, offer something slightly different to bitcoin, such as quicker transaction times or greater anonymity.

Yet it is the pseudo cryptocurrencies being developed by countries and companies that could see the most mainstream success over the coming decade. They will not be decentralised and will likely be tools to track users rather than provide privacy, but they will solve two of the biggest problems: trust and stability.

“Cryptocurrencies have arguably been the radical fintech innovation of the decade. But while the 2010s has been an exploratory phase – introducing the concepts of cryptocurrencies and blockchain to the world – the 2020s will be the decade for innovation and application,” Christel Quek, co-founder of cryptocurrency company Bolt, tells The Independent.

Beyond new currencies inspired by bitcoin, a whole new industry is forming from its underlying blockchain technology. At its core, it provides an immutable and unhackable platform for storing and transacting digital assets and records, meaning it could potentially transform everything from healthcare to the food industry.

Felix Shipkevich, a New York-based lawyer with expertise in blockchain regulations, says the technology ""has the power to change the world for the better"" by providing a new standard for accountability and trust.

Bitcoin has not only brought blockchain into existence, it has challenged regulatory obstacles that stand in the way of this new wave of applications being realised.

“Cryptocurrencies have given rise to regulators’ acceptance of digital cash and fintech products and services that are both novel and progressive,"" Shipkevich tells The Independent. ""We’ve seen greater acceptance by regulators versus total rejection.

""We saw this happen in China, where crypto trading was strictly prohibited, but are now announcing the use of blockchain technology as a major government and fiscal technology initiative.”

The 2010s may have been defined by bitcoin but the next 10 years will dictate which cryptocurrency truly takes off and emerges to rival traditional currencies.

It would be foolish to write-off bitcoin - its death has been pronounced more than 350 times in the press, according to a website tracking ""bitcoin obituaries"" - but its flaws could see it become simply a store of value rather than a mainstream form of exchange.

Much like MySpace and Bebo were usurped by Facebook in the early days of social media, another cryptocurrency could come along to take bitcoin's crown as the most popular cryptocurrency - maybe even Facebook's Libra.

If this happens, predictions about bitcoin's price reaching $500,000 or even $1 million over the next few years will appear wildly ambitious. Then again, it has proved its doubters wrong more than once before.

At the start of the decade, bitcoin was worth just $0.03. It will likely close out the 2010’s somewhere north of $7,000.

Another Great Recession could cause enough of a seismic shift in the established order for bitcoin's price to rocket once again and for Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision to finally be realised.

Or it could continue its steady yet chaotic climb to achieve mainstream success through favourable regulation and greater commercial acceptance, which has been quietly underway over the last decade.",2019-12-06 08:07:32+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-pyramid-scheme-in-uganda-steals-employees-money-and-closes,"An alleged cryptocurrency pyramid scheme in Uganda has fled after defrauding dozens of victims that invested in and worked for the scheme.

Dunamiscoins Resources Limited opened in Masaka last month and started inviting individuals to invest and become part of its “digital currency network,” independent Ugandan newspaper Daily Monitor reports Dec. 5. The firm’s offices closed down covertly just a month after opening, with employees reportedly coming to the office to find it empty.

Dunamiscoins required employees to pay to start work

A businessman who worked next to Dunamiscoins’ closed offices reportedly said that Dunamiscoins was convincing people to join its firm by promising 40% returns on cash investments. According to the witness, the firm was apparently working with money transfer companies in the city to recruit new people to the scheme.

Additionally, Dunamiscoins allegedly asked each applicant to pay 20,000 Uganda shillings ($5) to register with the company. According to a former Dunamiscoins salesperson, the firm promised high returns on investments but fleeced its employees of money paid for registration as well.

Daily Monitor attempted to get in touch with Dunamiscoins but none of the phone numbers obtained by the publication was available, the report notes. Cointelegraph reached out to an email address mentioned on Dunamiscoins’ website only to receive a notice that the listed address couldn't be found.

The report follows a recent announcement by the deputy governor of the Bank of Uganda that online cryptocurrency businesses are not regulated in the country to date. In June 2019, the official warned the public on the limited protections offered them when they invest in unregulated cryptocurrencies, also outlining a number of risks associated with crypto trading and adoption.",,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/deutsche-bank-study-bitcoin-and-crypto-could-replace-fiat-currencies-by-2030/,"Deutsche Bank’s analyst Jim Reid has published a new study entitled “Imagine 2030”.

In the study, Reid describes the potential of the cryptocurrency industry to revolutionize the established financial system by 2030.

Although Bitcoin has been around for almost 11 years, Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention is still far from becoming a world currency. According to a new study by Deutsche Bank and its chief analyst Jim Reid, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could replace the current Fiat currency system by 2030. As Reid describes in his research entitled “Imagine 2030,” the crypto industry has the potential to replace the established financial system by 2030.

An important factor for this trend, as Reid notes, is the increased demand of people for dematerialized means of payment and anonymity. Reid also points out that uncontrollable inflation and the rise in the gold price in the 1970s after the end of the gold-hedged monetary system could be a major cause of the trend towards cryptocurrencies.

The Multi-Billion-Dollar (or Bitcoin) Question

According to Reid, the global inflation might cause the populations of the world to lose confidence in paper money. According to Reid, global inflation has been limited in recent years by China’s economic growth and its rise as “the greatest suppressor of global inflation in the last four decades” thanks to a massive increase in labour supply. This era is coming to an end. According to the findings of the study, the Fiat system is now held together by “fragile” parts:

The forces that hold the fiat money system together look fragile, particularly decades of low labour costs. Over the next decade, some of these forces could begin to unravel and demand for alternative currencies, from gold to crypto, could take off.

As a result of rising inflation and the burden of negative interest rates on citizens, doubts about state-sponsored money will increase and demand for alternative currencies will rise. After all, cryptocurrencies could replace the current financial system with Fiat currencies, as Reid noted:

Eventually, it is possible that inflation will become more and more embedded in our system and doubts will rise about the sustainability of fiat money. The demand for alternative currencies will therefore likely be significantly higher by the time 2030 rolls around. Will fiat currencies survive the policy dilemma that authorities will experience as they try to balance higher yields with record levels of debt? That’s the multi-trillion dollar (or bitcoin) question for the decade ahead

Furthermore, the Deutsche Bank analyst points out that cryptocurrencies have significant advantages over the current monetary system, such as “security, speed, minimal transaction fees, easy storage and relevance in the digital age”. Nevertheless, Reid notes that they have not managed to assert themselves as a means of payment. However, he gives a different outlook for the future:

This situation could be different in the future.

The challenges for cryptocurrencies

According to the study, cryptocurrencies have to overcome three major hurdles in order to achieve greater acceptance. These include legitimizing them in the eyes of governments and regulators, which would increase price stability and enable global reach in the payment market. This requires alliances with key stakeholders such as mobile apps like Apple Pay, Google Pay and card providers like Visa and Mastercard, as well as merchants like Amazon and Walmart.

At the same time, Reid pointed out that the introduction to the mainstream will create new challenges. Among the biggest threats to the supposedly digital currency-based financial system, Reid cited the dependence on electricity, cyber attacks and a digital war.

Regarding the study, it should be noted that Jim Reid has repeatedly warned of a financial crisis and the unstable Fiat currency system in the past. As early as September 2017, he published a similar study for Deutsche Bank in which he warned of the collapse of the currency system and emphasized the potential of cryptocurrencies.

While Reid warns of the collapse of the financial system, governments around the world are already discussing the need to develop national digital currencies. In countries like China, Japan, British Virgin Islands and France there are already specific plans and developments.

Tax season is still months away, but the IRS will want to know about your cryptocurrency holdings. The IRS just released a new Schedule 1 for the 2019 tax season, spelling out the details on above-the-line deductions, including the tax break for student loan interest and health savings account contributions. Eagle-eyed taxpayers will notice that the IRS threw in an extra question on the form: ""At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?"" This is the agency's latest effort to gather additional information on taxpayers' virtual currency holdings. See below for the form

""The biggest thing is that the IRS is asking this for a reason, and my question is how much have you increased your audit risk by checking 'Yes' in response?"" asked Jeffrey Levine, CPA and director of financial planning at BluePrint Wealth Alliance in Garden City, New York. The inquiry itself is a vague one, experts said. ""As a taxpayer myself, I find this question very frustrating because it isn't clear,"" said Sarah-Jane Morin, partner at Morgan Lewis in San Francisco.

Moving your own virtual currency from one crypto wallet to another, for instance, could be considered ""sending,"" she said ""The most conservative approach that a taxpayer can take is to consider any interaction you've had with virtual currency and whether there's any way this can fall under this very broad list of what you could've engaged in during 2019,"" said Morin. Indeed, the IRS has signaled that it would be taking a closer look at cryptocurrency. Back in July, the agency announced it was sending letters to more than 10,000 taxpayers with virtual currency transactions who may have failed to report income and pay taxes owed. Here are the tax basics on cryptocurrency.

Varying tax treatments

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters in Washington, D.C. Janhvi Bhojwani | CNBC

If you sold your cryptocurrency, you need to report the transaction. If you wound up with a capital gain, you must pay the appropriate tax. Cryptocurrency you receive from an employer is subject to federal income tax withholding, FICA tax and federal unemployment taxes, just like wages. These should be reported on your Form W-2, the IRS said. Meanwhile, independent contractors who are paid in virtual currency must pay self-employment taxes. For those who mine cryptocurrency, the fair market value of it as of the day of receipt is included in your gross income, according to IRS guidance.

Failure to properly report these transactions can be costly: You may be audited and held liable for penalties and interest. In the most extreme cases, you could face prison time and a fine of up to $250,000. ""A taxpayer who is investing in virtual currency should have a system for tracking the purchase and selling price of the assets,"" said April Walker, lead manager for tax practice and ethics at the American Institute of CPAs. ""For tax purposes, the virtual currency is treated as property, similar to a security,"" she said. ""Therefore, taxpayers should maintain cost records similar to the way records are kept for stocks and securities, although there will be no monthly statements.""

Does the world need more stablecoins? Yes according to VCs, who have thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at projects developing stable or low volatility digital assets. The $45 million committed in 2019 takes the past two years of VC investment to over $200M.

A Stable Full of Stablecoins

Stablecoin projects need venture capital firms, just as VCs need crypto projects that have a high chance of gaining mass adoption – and stablecoins seem a safer bet than altcoins. Given that the nature of fiat-pegged digital assets precludes the possibility of price appreciation, a public token sale is off-limits. Instead, venture capital from crypto-focused investment firms, which often seek equity, is the preferred route to stablecoin funding. The following are just some of the stable or “stable-ish” digital currencies to have emerged this year through VC funding.

Saga

Saga (SGA) is a digital token designed to serve as a general purpose global currency. It’s backed by a basket of monetary reserves, which it will gradually gravitate away from through a monetary model that will constrict the circulating supply. Saga’s designers aim to create a low volatility coin with “dependable value,” governance, and compliance built in. The project, which is launching this month, raised $30M in 2018 with backing from Lightspeed, Mangrove Capital Partners, and Vertex Ventures.

Terra

Stablecoin project Terra raised $32M in 2018 with seed funding from the investment division of four of the six largest cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance Labs, Okex, and Huobi Capital. Terra is working on a stablecoin and blockchain payment solution which it’s integrating into the Terra Alliance, a Libra-like consortium of global ecommerce partners.

Ava Labs

Ava Labs, which exited stealth mode in May this year, has raised $6 million in seed. Although not a stablecoin, its DLT payment network is designed for fast asset settlement, including stablecoins, and fiat redeemable assets. Ava bridges private and public blockchains and enables customizable marketplaces to be created for deploying and exchanging assets in a compliant manner. The project is the brainchild of crypto academic Emin Gün Sirer. The Ava Labs CEO, who has Turkish heritage, took to Twitter on December 4 to highlight another new stablecoin – Bilira, a digital token pegged to the Turkish lira.

Ampleforth

Not a stablecoin and yet not a pure cryptocurrency, Ampleforth is designed to have low volatility, achieved through expanding and constricting the supply to control price. The project raised $9.8M in seed funding before holding an IEO in May and listing on Bitfinex.

Monerium

Blockchain-based e-money project Monerium raised $2 million this year, with participation from Consensys and Hof Holdings. The Icelandic startup intends to issue asset-backed e-money that’s transferred onchain, and redeemable for fiat.

Paxos Standard

The Paxos Standard (PAX) stablecoin was developed with the aid of $65M in Series B funding from the likes of RRE Ventures, Liberty City Ventures, and Jay Jordan in 2018. This followed a previous Series A round of $28 million.

USDC

Circle raised $100 million in spring 2018, with a tranche of this funding going towards creating and issuing its USDC stablecoin. The stablecoin has since been added to dozens of exchanges, wallets, and lending platforms, finding a place for itself in the cryptosphere, despite failing to land a punch on Tether, which still dominates the stablecoin market. In March, Circle revealed that it was hoping to raise another $250M in funding.

Other stablecoin raises of note include xDai, which secured $500,000 in August from NGC Ventures, B-Tech, and Bixin Invest. Earlier this year, Kava Labs also secured $1.5 million for its USDX stablecoin, with funding from Ripple’s Xpring initiative and Coil.

$200 Million and Counting

VCs have invested over $205 million in stablecoin projects in the last two years, with $45 million of that total arriving this year. While more money was raised by stablecoins last year, the rate of new projects hasn’t alleviated. Many of this year’s new stablecoins have been issued by exchanges themselves, obviating the need for VC funding. Moreover, the $205M figure doesn’t include the VC money that’s being poured into Facebook’s Project Libra: in April, it was reported that $1 billion was being sought.

With new stable and “stable-ish” coins set to launch, Libra in the works, and 69% of central banks working on CBDCs, the stage is set for an impending global currency war. Instead of pitting fiat currencies against the U.S. dollar, it will see digital tokens – some asset-backed, others collateralized, and others algorithmically controlled – compete for supremacy. Their compliant and regulated nature, however, means that whatever happens, they will not be capable of supplanting bitcoin.

Do you think any of the forthcoming stablecoins has a chance of competing with Tether? Let us know in the comments section below.

On Dec. 6, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the new crypto tax code is a further follow-up to provisions made by the RFB in August that require Brazilian citizens to report all transactions involving cryptocurrencies, in accordance with rules established by Normative Instruction 1,888 introduced in May 2019.

The already implemented tax code applies to individuals, companies and brokerages, and includes all crypto-related activities, including buying and selling, as well as donations, barters, deposits, withdrawals and others.

Those who fail to file a statement on their crypto transactions will be subject to penalties ranging from 500 Brazil reals (BRD) to 1500 BRD, or from $120 to $360.

In August, Cointelegraph reported that RFB believes that the cryptocurrency market in Brazil has more investors than Brazil’s second-oldest stock exchange, B3, which reportedly had about 800,000 customers at the time.

RFB almost ran out of money

At the beginning of September, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the RFB said that it will run out of funds by the end of the month. The tax authority reportedly said at the time that if the Brazilian government does not unlock financial resources, the tax agency would terminate agreements with contractors, stop issuing individual taxpayer registry identification numbers and paying income tax refunds.

Cryptocurrency exchanges also risked being affected, as the requirement that they report all user data and transactions involves the use of an RFB system. If the system shut down, crypto exchanges would simultaneously be legally compelled but unable to comply with data reporting requirements.",,https://www.coindesk.com/microsoft-collaboration-news-fuels-50-rally-for-enjins-cryptocurrency,"Microsoft’s collaboration with blockchain gaming startup Enjin has prompted a roughly 50 percent surge in the project’s native token over a two-day period.

Enjin coin (ENJ) started to rise sharply from Wednesday afternoon (UTC) as news spread of a rewards scheme from the tech giant that uses Enjin technology and the ethereum blockchain. Known as Azure Heroes, the scheme rewards community members with crypto collectibles (or NFTs) for good deeds, such as mentoring, providing demos, creating content and more.

This is Enjin’s second major news-based rally this year, after Samsung added Enjin’s cryptocurrency to the Blockchain Keystore on its flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S10, in March.

At the time, prices rose by more than 70 percent on rumors surrounding the release. Since then, ENJ has declined from a high of around $0.25 down to as low as $0.046 on Nov. 29.

With the latest Microsoft-fueled rally, price peaked at around $0.1059 on Friday morning (UTC), CoinMarketCap data shows. A press time, the rally looks to be losing steam slightly, with prices down to $0.0987.

As seen above, price action for ENJ had been stuck between two defined areas of support and resistance, between $0.051 and $0.068 for a period of about 72 days.

In all likelihood, Enjin coin bulls were beginning to grow thirsty for more developments to light a fire under prices. Now it would seem their prayers have been answered with the sharp breakout prompted by this week’s news.

Rico Solo, a long-time investor in small-cap coins and an ENJ trader said he plans to take around 25 percent profit on this rally to guard against further downside risk in prices.

Binance Coin, or BNB, is the only major cryptocurrency outperforming bitcoin this year, but its namesake exchange is facing new concerns around increased competition, police raid rumors, and its ""burning"" practice.

The Binance exchange faced new scrutiny after it said in November it has no ""fixed offices in Shanghai or China"" following reports of a police raid in the country, Bloomberg first reported.

The exchange also destroys, or ""burns,"" a portion of BNB coins in circulation each quarter as part of a plan to slash supply in half.

Though Binance buys the coins off investors before destroying them, the practice likely serves as a factor in BNB's surge in 2019 and demand may wane once the burns reach their goal.

BNB's popularity as the leading exchange token now faces opposition from new firms looking to corner the initial-exchange-offering market.

Watch BNB trade live here.

Binance Coin is the only major cryptocurrency outperforming bitcoin this year, but its namesake exchange faces heightened scrutiny for its ""burning"" practice and police raid rumors.

The coin, typically referred to as BNB, allows holders to gain access to trading discounts and other benefits on Binance, the world's largest spot cryptocurrency exchange. BNB is up roughly 156% year-to-date, dwarfing bitcoin's 100% surge.

The digital coin's outperformance was first reported by Bloomberg.

The coin's run-up is likely boosted by the exchange's quarterly practice of destroying, or ""burning,"" BNB to reduce the number of tokens outstanding. Binance plans to burn half of the total BNB supply — about 100 million coins — before pausing the practice. Though it buys the coins from holders before destroying them, the practice drives BNB demand as users still look to use its benefits.

Binance destroyed $36.7 million worth of BNB at the end of the third quarter, or roughly 2 million coins. The exchange determines the amount of BNB to destroy based on its quarterly trading volume, and the latest burn hints the firm posted its most profitable quarter ever in the July-to-September period, Bloomberg reported.

The platform also enjoys looser regulatory scrutiny due to its registration in Malta, yet critics are calling for Binance to clarify rumors around a reported raid on offices in China. A spokesperson for the firm told Bloomberg it has no ""fixed offices in Shanghai or China,"" yet the rumored police search raised worries around whether the exchange is misleading investors to avoid China's crypto regulations.

BNB's surge cooled alongside other cryptos through the second half of the year, and a decline in initial exchange offerings on the platform could further hamper its performance. Binance customers used BNB to purchase coins sold by startups on the exchange, but as competitors with similar discount tokens crop up, Binance's popularity has faced new threats.

""BNB's large relative outperformance came in the first part of this year, as the IEO craze reached its peak,"" Travis Kling, who leads hedge fund Ikigai Asset Management, told Bloomberg. ""IEOs have cooled off a lot of its relative outperformance.""

BNB traded at $15.61 per coin at 3:10 p.m. ET. bitcoin traded at $7,456.46 per coin.

A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other.

Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.

The technology for this revolution — and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution — has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency.

But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.

The State will, of course, try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.

Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions.

Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.

Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved an investment fund that will invest in bitcoin futures contracts. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce calls this move “a bit of progress.” The SEC has also revealed why it decided to approve such a fund.

Bitcoin Futures Fund Cleared to Launch

The U.S. SEC declared the registration statement filed by Stone Ridge Trust VI for the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund effective on Monday. The company filed Form N-2 with the SEC on Oct. 2 and amended it twice, on Oct. 16 and Nov. 26. This form is used by closed-end management investment companies to register and offer their shares under the Securities Act. Stone Ridge Asset Management Llc will be the fund’s investment adviser. As of Aug. 30, the company managed approximately $15 billion of assets.

The NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund “is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that continuously offers its shares,” the filing details, adding:

The fund pursues its investment objective primarily by investing in bitcoin futures contracts … The only bitcoin futures in which the fund will invest are cash-settled bitcoin futures traded on commodity exchanges registered with the CFTC.

“The fund will not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly,” the filing emphasizes. “The fund will seek to purchase a number of bitcoin futures so that the total value of the bitcoin underlying the bitcoin futures held by the fund is as close to 100% of the net assets of the fund.” Its shares are being offered initially at an offering price of $10 per share. Only institutional investors, their clients, and certain eligible investors as specified in the fund’s prospectus can invest in the fund. Currently, CME is the only CFTC-approved exchange offering cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts.

The fund has an interval structure; it aims to conduct quarterly share repurchase offers, which it expects to be for a maximum of 5% of the fund’s outstanding shares at net asset value per quarter. The initial quarterly repurchase offer is planned for May 2020. This fund will not be a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), however, as its filing states:

The fund’s shares are not listed and the fund does not currently intend to list its shares for trading on any national securities exchange.

‘A Bit of Progress’

At the 2019 ICI Securities Law Developments Conference on Tuesday, Dalia Blass, Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management, talked about cryptocurrency ETFs and the SEC staff’s decision to approve a fund investing in bitcoin futures contracts. “We welcome and value constructive industry engagement regarding new products and novel investment strategies,” she said. “A prime example of such engagement involves registered funds seeking to invest substantially in digital assets and related investments.”

Blass explained that she issued a public letter last year calling on the fund industry to discuss issues presented by such investments, elaborating:

As a result of this engagement, we are at the point that a registered closed-end interval fund with a bitcoin futures strategy is preparing to launch. To reach this point, the fund first responded to each of the issues identified in the staff letter.

Commenting on Blass’ speech, Commissioner Hester Peirce, aka Crypto Mom, tweeted on Wednesday that the agency’s move is “A bit of progress.”

Without naming the fund, Blass explained that it expects “to generally value its bitcoin futures holdings at daily settlement prices reflected on a CFTC-registered futures exchange, consistent with the principles of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and U.S. GAAP.”

As for custody, the director clarified that since the fund will invest in cash-settled bitcoin futures, it “will not face the challenges presented by direct holdings of digital assets.” In addition, it is a closed-end interval fund which means it “will not offer daily redemptions and will not be subject to potentially large, unexpected liquidity demands over short periods.” Blass further described that “as an unlisted fund, its pricing will not depend on an efficient arbitrage mechanism and the willingness of market makers to make markets in a fund pursuing a digital asset strategy,” noting:

The fund also has taken steps to address issues related to potential manipulation in the digital asset markets.

“This includes prominent risk disclosures, offering the product only through registered investment advisers, and limiting the size and future growth of the fund, with an initial cap of $25 million,” the director concluded.

Germany’s second-largest stock exchange, Boerse Stuttgart, has opened up its cryptocurrency trading platform to all interested traders in the country. This move follows the passing of a bill allowing banks in Germany to sell and hold cryptocurrencies for their clients starting next year.

Regulated Crypto Trading Platform

Boerse Stuttgart announced Friday that its digital asset trading platform is “now open to any interested persons in Germany.” The BSDEX platform was launched in September but only for selected users. The company described:

At Germany’s first regulated trading venue for digital assets, users can currently trade bitcoin against the euro. Additional digital assets are to be added.

To access the BSDEX platform, the user must be at least 18 years of age, a resident of Germany, a European Economic Area (EEA) national, and have a German bank account. The platform offers free cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals with varying trading fees based on the order type.

“The BSDEX is a multilateral trading system that brings together buyers and sellers of digital assets through an open order book,” Boerse Stuttgart explained, adding that customer orders are executed directly against each other. The company elaborated:

At the moment our offer is limited to Germany. However, our goal is to make it available in other countries in the future.

The digital asset platform complies with the regulatory requirements of the German Banking Act. The Baden-Württembergische Wertpapierbörse, which also acts as a holding company of the public stock exchange, regulates and monitors the compliance of the platform. The technical operator of the BSDEX is the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange, a joint venture between the Boerse Stuttgart Group, Axel Springer, and Finanzen. Blocknox, a subsidiary of the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, acts as the custodian holding customers’ cryptocurrencies.

Early this year, Boerse Stuttgart launched a crypto trading app called Bison, developed by Sowa Labs, a fintech subsidiary of the Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures. The smartphone app can be used to buy and sell BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP from financial services provider Euwax AG, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart.

Germany’s Crypto-Forward Bill

Germany has recently emerged as a crypto haven following the passing of a bill on Nov. 29 which allows banks to sell and hold cryptocurrencies for their clients starting next year. The new rules have been adopted as part of the implementation of “Directive (EU) 2018/843 of 30 May 2018,” the fifth AML Directive, explained global law firm Dentons.

Under the new rules, crypto assets qualify as financial instruments, the law firm continued, emphasizing that this was disputed in the past. According to the firm, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) took the view that utility tokens did not qualify as financial instruments, but investment tokens qualify as securities and currency tokens qualify as “units of account” — both of which fall under the definition of financial instruments pursuant to the German Banking Act.

The new rules also include licensing requirements. Companies wanting to provide crypto trading or custody services are required to obtain a license from Bafin as a bank or an investment firm, the law firm further detailed. “Entities that provide no other financial services than custody are exempted from certain rules that apply to other investment firms.” Among other requirements, companies seeking a license for only the crypto asset business must have an initial capital of 125,000 euros ($138,234). Dentons added:

The new law will enter into force on January 1, 2020, subject to certain transition periods.

Entities wanting to obtain a license for crypto-related services should notify Bafin of their intention to obtain a license on or before March 31, 2020. The law firm clarified that “In such case, the license will be deemed to be awarded on a preliminary basis, provided that they will submit a complete application for a license no later than November 30, 2020.”

Over the past five years, the West African country has become the fastest-growing mobile money market on the continent. The burgeoning number of mobile money users is proof that digitized payments systems are providing a means for people to become financially active.

According to a 2019 economic analysis by the World Bank, the number of registered mobile money accounts in the country exploded from just 3.8 million to 23.9 million between 2012 and 2017.

The statistics alone speak volumes to the power of mobile networks in providing a means for previously unbanked or financially-excluded people to transact money remotely. Mobile phones are giving a large number of Ghanaians the chance to become financially active without having to use cash or card services.

The move to mobile payments has not gone unnoticed by the country’s central bank. At the end of November 2019, the Bank of Ghana announced plans to explore the use of a central bank digital currency in the new year.

Bank of Ghana governor Dr. Ernest Addison revealed that the bank has been working on a pilot project with a number of stakeholders to test the issuance and use of a digital currency. The announcement was made at Ghana’s National Banking Conference at the end of November. The move is an effort by the nation’s authorities to stay abreast of the increasing volume of mobile money users in Ghana and drive the digitization of its financial sector.

Crypto unregulated in Ghana

The surge in popularity and users of mobile money services in the country does not necessarily mean that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are enjoying the same level of success in Ghana.

Cryptocurrencies are currently unregulated in the West African nation, and there are no laws governing their use — a fact which has been confirmed by the Ghana Securities and Exchange Commission to Cointelegraph.

While the sector remains unregulated, the Ghana SEC issued a public warning to investors in March 2019. The note cautions investors to do their due diligence when dealing with unregistered or unlicensed trading platforms touting “high returns on investment.”

In its warning letter, the SEC listed 24 cryptocurrencies that have gained prominence worldwide, including BTC, ETH, LTC and XRP, while clearly stipulating that cryptocurrencies are not recognized as legal tender in the country.

When asked for a general gauge of the level of interest in cryptocurrencies in Ghana, the SEC’s policy research department manager, Frank Donkor, told Cointelegraph that an in-depth market study has yet to be undertaken:

“We have not conducted a market survey to determine the interest in cryptocurrencies, however, as indicated in the public notice, people are attracted to it because of the promises of high returns on their investments.”

Donkor also dismissed various reports earlier this year by local media outlets that suggested the local SEC would consider licensing the use of cryptocurrencies. This will continue to remain a barrier to entry for cryptocurrency users in the country according to the official:

“There are no legislations backing the trading and use of cryptocurrencies in Ghana. Thus investors who tend to invest in such currencies or assets may be doing so at their own risk and are not protected under the Securities law regime in Ghana.”

Apathy toward cryptocurrency continues

There seems to be a certain amount of apathy toward cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in Ghana, evident in the blanket statement and public warnings issued earlier this year. The Ghana SEC’s belief that a major drawcard for using cryptocurrency is the promise of high returns on investments suggests that the body could be lacking knowledge about the technology and efficacy of the systems underpinning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Omar Majdoub, president of registered non-profit organization Blockchain Society Ghana, believes that the general populace as well as policy makers in the country are ill-informed about the basics of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

According to Majdoub, there is a growing interest in the sector in the country, but misinformation has led many people to perceive all cryptocurrencies as fraudulent money-making schemes. He added that there is curiosity toward the applications of blockchain technology, but actual adoption of the technology is low.

Related: Africa Using Blockchain to Drive Change: Nigeria and Kenya, Part One

Unsuspecting investors around the world have been duped by various crypto scams, and Ghana’s people are no exception. Majdoub suggests that an effort to protect the Ghanaian public from similar situations has led to the negative perception toward the sector in 2019:

“I believe government authorities are mostly under informed about cryptocurrencies, and Blockchain Society Ghana hopes to rectify that by having more dialogue. We hope to clarify the legitimate uses of crypto and how to distinguish from scams.”

Will Ghana’s CBDC be blockchain-based?

What remains to be seen is whether the Ghana Central Bank’s digital currency will be developed using blockchain infrastructure. Cointelegraph reached out to the Bank of Ghana to clarify the details of the pilot project for its central bank digital currency, but has not received an official response on the matter.

Given the current stance of the Ghanian SEC and its central bank, it seems unlikely that the project will be based on a blockchain platform. At the same time, the explosion of mobile money users in the country suggests that the medium could be a prime candidate to provide the infrastructure for the planned central bank digital currency.

Nevertheless, the possibility of an e-cedi being issued and available to the public in Ghana is a positive step toward providing a regulated, digitized form of payment in a country that has traditionally struggled with soaring inflation.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/while-markets-move-sideways-crypto-whale-sightings-increase/,"While Markets Move Sideways, Crypto Whale Sightings Increase

While cryptocurrency markets have been moving sideways during the last few weeks, digital currency proponents have been observing large bitcoin whale movements. Transactions with tens of thousands of BTC have been noticed on the move from one wallet to another. On Friday, one colossal BTC holder moved over 50,000 BTC ($410 million) and cycled the funds through multiple addresses.

Bitcoin Whale Sightings

One of cryptocurrency’s favorite topics is the subject of whales and the large digital currency holders who can make prices swing with a single transaction. Depending on who you ask, the definition of a whale can vary. Some believe that a whale can hold 1,000 BTC or more to make it into the club. In February, the number of addresses that had 1,000 to 10,000 BTC ($7.5-75.1 million) was approximately 1,709. Since then, the number of these types of whales increased by 18.6% as there are 2,028 addresses with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC today. While BTC spot prices seem stagnant at the end of 2019, every now and then there’s been unexpected price spikes and rapid drops in value over the last two months. Crypto speculators have attributed this market action to whales buying and selling thousands of coins.

For instance, crypto enthusiasts have focused their attention on the Twitter bot Whale Alert, an account that tracks onchain settlement for coins like BTC, ETH and XRP. During the late evening on Sept. 5, U.S. EST, a whale moved 94,504 BTC or $711 million in one fell swoop. A few weeks ago, on Oct. 17, a transaction for 9,999 BTC ($75 million) caught the crowd’s attention.

Last Wednesday, during the early morning trading sessions onchain observers witnessed 43,564 BTC ($327 million) withdrawn from the exchange Bittrex. A few days later, on Friday, another whale moved 55,354 BTC ($410 million) from unknown wallet to another unknown wallet. The Twitter bot Whale Alert registered at the time more than $10 billion worth of these cycled transactions and the account noted that the transactions were “very likely change transactions” or some form of consolidation. Within roughly 30 minutes, there were 22 transactions recorded with movements of over 55,000 BTC.

342,000 Ethereum on the Move

Besides the BTC whales moving massive amounts of funds, digital currency observers have been watching the ETH whale who drained 342,000 ETH ($50 million) from Upbit’s hot wallet on Nov. 27. After the hack, the South Korean exchange Upbit promised to compensate all of the funds that were taken. The stolen ether started moving on Dec. 3, as both the Twitter bot Whale Alert and Etherscan flagged the transactions. In the last 24 hours, the hacker continues to shift the funds to different addresses in large amounts.

So far, there’s been a total of eight ETH transactions on the move that stem from the Upbit hack in November. With every transaction, the funds have been sent to unknown Ethereum addresses to sit and so far none of the funds have been sent to known exchange addresses. The eight transactions also followed a pattern on Saturday as one transaction worth 1,000 ETH would be sent, it would be followed by another transaction worth 10,000 ETH.

Onchain movements and giant whales have always fascinated the crypto community and whale sightings can be seen on numerous blockchains. The reason large holders are focused upon in this regard is that their massive movements can sway markets in the blink of an eye. Despite the massive transfers, the crowd cannot truly connect large transactions to major market movements, but it’s safe to say the crypto community will eagerly continue to watch whale activities.

How much Bitcoin will miners receive after the next halving?

Every new block will produce 6.25 BTC. At inception, the reward was eight times as much.

When Bitcoin was launched in 2009, miners were receiving 50 BTC per block. Thus, a total of 10,500,000 BTC was generated before the next halving took place in November 2012, when miners began to receive 25 BTC for each block.

It may seem like an overly generous bonus (more than $365,000 per block, based on current value), but the network was only just starting to develop at the time, and no one knew for certain whether people would continue to find the concept worthy of investing their computer processing power into the Bitcoin blockchain to keep it alive.

Another fact to take into account is that the all-time high market price for that period was $31 per BTC in June 2011, but that “bubble” later burst and Bitcoin was back to $2 before the year’s end. Nevertheless, mining has ultimately turned out to be much more profitable for those who got in early, which is a big part of the reason Bitcoin critics call it a Ponzi scheme.

The second Bitcoin halving occurred on July 6, 2016, as block number 420,000 was produced and miners began collecting 12.5 BTC for every new block, which is the current rate. The third halving will reduce that rate in half yet again, which will lower the block reward to just 6.25 BTC, or around $45,000 given the current market price.",2019-12-08 11:47:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/deutsche-bank-strategist-predicts-crypto-could-replace-fiat-money/,"Deutsche Bank Strategist Predicts Crypto Could Replace Fiat Money

Deutsche Bank analysts have made some predictions regarding the future of cryptocurrency. Strategist Jim Reid explained why cryptocurrencies are inevitable and how the existing fiat money system could crumble over the next decade, leading to soaring demand for cryptocurrencies.

‘The End of Fiat Money?’ – Cryptocurrencies Are Inevitable

Deutsche Bank Research released a special edition of Konzept entitled “Imagine 2030” on Thursday. Konzept is a regularly published research report that addresses the fundamental issues driving the world of economics and finance. In the 84-page special edition, Deutsche Bank analysts discussed contrarian ideas of how the 2020s may evolve.

Jim Reid, Global Head of Fundamental Credit, Strategy and Thematic Research at Deutsche Bank, wrote in the report: “While critics bemoan cryptocurrencies as constrained by regulatory hurdles, we believe the incentives of governments and card providers are such that digital currencies are inevitable.” He authored the section of the report entitled “The end of fiat money?” Reid detailed:

The forces that have held the current fiat system together now look fragile and they could unravel in the 2020s. If so, that will start to lead to a backlash against fiat money and demand for alternative currencies, such as gold or crypto could soar.

Cryptocurrencies Could Replace Cash

One of the sections of the report discusses cryptocurrencies as “the 21st century cash.” Marion Laboure authored this section, with contribution from Anthony Chaimowitz, Market Research Lead for the EMEA and APAC regions at the bank. “Until now, cryptocurrencies have been additions, rather than substitutes, to the global inventory of money,” Laboure explained, asserting that “Over the next decade, this may change.” She elaborated:

Overcoming regulatory hurdles will broaden their appeal and raise the potential to eventually replace cash.

Laboure provided a comparison between the adoption rates of cryptocurrencies and the internet by examining the number of Blockchain wallet users and the number of internet users over multiple years. “It is early days but the curves are similar after adjusting for scale,” she claims. “Indeed, if current trends continue, there could be 200m blockchain wallet users in 2030.”

To achieve widespread adoption, Laboure believes that cryptocurrencies must become legitimate in the eyes of governments and regulators. They must also “allow for global reach in the payment market.” Furthermore, “To do this, alliances must be forged with key stakeholders – mobile apps such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, card providers such as Visa and Mastercard, and retailers, such as Amazon and Walmart,” she opined. “If these challenges can be overcome, the eventual future of cash is at risk.” Laboure continued:

As we look to the decade ahead, it would not be surprising if a new and mainstream cryptocurrency were to unexpectedly emerge.

“Cryptocurrencies may constitute the best tool for a digital war,” she added, pointing out that some countries with historically-strong banking industries are already trialing them. “The question is which country will take advantage of being the first to obtain licenses and build alliances. As that occurs, the line between cryptocurrencies, financial institutions, and public and private sectors may become blurred,” she concluded.

The Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s legislature, has approved amendments that introduce legal terms and definitions pertaining to the crypto space. The new legislation, which aims to transpose the FATF standards into national law, also identifies who is to take responsibility for the oversight of cryptocurrencies in the country.

Using Crypto for Payments and Investments

The draft law on the prevention of the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction proliferation was supported by a significant majority in the Rada. The bill was amended to incorporate “virtual assets” which have been described as property and as a digital expression of value that can be traded or transferred and used for payment or investment purposes.

Ukraine’s anti-money laundering (AML) legislation introduces the standards for virtual assets adopted this year by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The members of the inter-governmental organization recently agreed to monitor and assess the implementation of the crypto requirements in different countries, as news.Bitcoin.com reported in October.

The law also introduces the term “provider of services related to the transfer, exchange and storage of virtual assets,” the crypto information outlet Forklog reveals in an article. An interesting detail is that not only corporate entities but private individuals as well will be allowed to offer such services under the new regulations.

All crypto operations will be subject to different levels of financial monitoring depending on the amount and destination of each transaction. The Ministry of Digital Transformation, which has been quite active this year, will be tasked to regulate the circulation of virtual assets in Ukraine. It will also conduct oversight to verify compliance with AML regulations in the crypto sphere.

Kiev to Increase Oversight as Part of EU Commitments

The amendments dealing with cryptocurrencies have been prepared by lawmakers from the multi-partisan parliamentary group ‘Blockchain4Ukraine’ with the help of the EU-funded expert and analytical center Better Regulation Delivery Office (BRDO) and members of the industry. They were voted on second reading this past Friday after the first reading took place on Nov. 1. The adoption of the law is part of Ukraine’s commitments under its association agreement with the EU, Ukrinform noted in a report, and will open the way for a tranche of €500 million in financial assistance.

Laws in Ukraine are typically passed on three consecutive readings. During the first one, deputies in the Rada accept the draft in principle. Then they have two weeks to propose amendments before the second reading takes place. The law is finally approved on a third reading. However, bills are often adopted during the second reading and sometimes even after the first. The status of the FATF-inspired bill on the Rada’s website is currently “adopted” and “being prepared for signing.” New laws in Ukraine are signed by the president.

During the last voting on Dec. 6, a strong majority of over 240 deputies supported the law that also incorporates provisions from EU’s Fourth and Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directives. One of the amendments introduced during the discussions in the Ukrainian parliament reduces the initially proposed penalties for breaches of the AML legislation. Another one obliges Ukraine’s financial regulators to align their substatutory acts with the new legislation within three months of its entering into force.

The current administration in Kiev, which took power after the election of Volodymyr Zelensky as president and the general election this summer — in which his Servant of the People party won a majority of seats — has been quite positive towards the country’s crypto community. A fund established recently by the Ukrainian government will distribute $18 million in grants among startups from innovative sectors of the economy including the blockchain industry.

Gift cards have become a popular payment tool for cryptocurrency users. Plenty of platforms now offer a wide variety of cards which can be purchased with your digital coins. You can use them to buy just about any product or service from major and small retailers, order food and drinks, or book a flight. And with the Christmas holidays approaching, don’t forget their main purpose is to make someone else happy.

Why It Works

For various reasons, crypto enthusiasts in many countries find it hard to obtain a crypto debit card these days. They used to be a sought after payment instrument that expanded the use of decentralized digital currencies in a fiat-dominated world. However, many early offerings have disappeared and while there are new products in the niche, these now often come with more and more strings attached. Although limited to a specific retailer, crypto gift cards are much easier to acquire in comparison to debit cards.

Bridging the gap between the crypto space and the traditional payments universe is undoubtedly an attractive business opportunity for many companies in the digital asset industry. At the same time, retailers that are still uneasy about adding cryptocurrencies to their payment options get additional revenue that would otherwise go somewhere else. Many people who run businesses or are employed in the crypto sector would prefer to spend the cryptocurrency they earned rather than convert it to fiat first.

Buy Gift Cards With Bitcoin

Sending some satoshis to someone you like or love is of course a great gift for any occasion. But money is such a common present that it betrays you might not have a clear idea of what the person you’d like to surprise really likes or wants. If you do know that, however, sending a gift card is a better option. Being able to buy it with cryptocurrency is great too.

The Bitcoin.com store offers you a wide choice of gift cards for major retailers and service providers, from the Home Depot and Macy’s, to Domino’s and Dunkin Donuts, even Uber. These and dozens of other options are sorted in multiple categories, from Electronics, Clothing and Restaurants, to Holiday Gift Ideas. You can buy a card for yourself or send it to a friend. At checkout you’ll be prompted to pay with either bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoin core (BTC).

Another platform that lets you buy gift cards with bitcoin is Egifter. You can order cards from over 250 retailers. Both BCH and BTC are supported, along with several other cryptocurrencies like ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC) and dash, as well as numerous fiat options like major bank cards and popular payment processors such as Paypal, Skrill, Apple Pay, and Amazon Pay. Those who have an account with Egifter can earn points on most purchases and later claim them for free gift cards.

A website called Ipayyou.io not only sells but also buys gift cards with cryptocurrency. It accepts and pays in BCH, BTC and BSV. The cards you can order are issued by Amazon, Ebay, Best Buy, Starbucks, Uber, and iTunes. They are fully returnable until the recipient logs in to claim them. If you receive a gift card that you don’t really need, you can sell it back to the platform for crypto but a restocking fee may apply.

Swych, a mobile gifting platform in the U.S., entered the crypto market earlier this year. In February, Swych announced it’s starting to accept cryptocurrencies for the virtual gift cards it issues for more than 600 retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and many more. In the app, which is available for Android and iOS devices, you can pay with BCH, BTC, LTC, ETH, and ETC, as news.Bitcoin.com reported. If you receive one of Swych’s virtual cards but you don’t want to spend the money in that particular store, a nice feature allows you to swap it for a card you can use with a different retailer.

If you need another mobile service accepting cryptocurrencies for a variety gift cards, you can check out Gyft. The app can be downloaded from Google Play and Apple’s App Store. “Use Bitcoin to shop for hundreds of gift cards. Instant delivery. No fees,” the platform promises. You can use it to buy, send and redeem gift cards from any mobile device. Gyft also lets you keep track of your gift card balances and currently accepts bitcoin core. Walmart, Lowe’s, Cabelas, and CVS are among the supported retailers.

You can also purchase gift cards using dozens of decentralized cryptocurrencies and stablecoins from the payments provider Bidali which is based in Canada. According to the dedicated page on its website, bitcoin cash and bitcoin core are among the supported cryptos. It also lists many well-known places where you can spend your digital money via gift card. The platform accepts coins for mobile top-ups as well.

Bitrefill sells gift cards from around the world for crypto. Its website detects your location and tailors its suggestions to your region. You can, for instance, list the most popular gift cards in the Eurozone countries. If users in the U.S. often buy cards for Google Play and the App Store, those in Europe’s single currency area would purchase cards for Skype, Viber, and Amazon.de. Bitrefill offers prepaid mobile phone refills too, for which it accepts bitcoin core, ethereum, litecoin, dash, and dogecoin.

If you are planning to travel for the upcoming Christmas holidays, several gift card platforms like Gyft, Egifter and Giftoff will offer you the opportunity to pay for services provided by airlines like Delta, Southwest, American Airlines, and Virgin. Using gift cards purchased with bitcoin to cover accommodations is not a problem either. Websites such as Flightgiftcard, Jet2Holidays, and Lastminute sell cards you can use to book flights and make hotel reservations.

The best (and worst) quotes, adoption and regulation highlights, leading coins, predictions and much more — a week on Cointelegraph in one link.

Top Stories This Week

It’s happened! Ethereum’s much-anticipated shift to Istanbul has been completed, and the system-wide update came into force when the network passed block #9069000 late on Saturday night. Vitalik Buterin claims capacity now has the potential to reach 3,000 transactions per second. Istanbul is designed to deliver interoperability with the privacy token Zcash and make it cheaper to use zero-knowledge technologies that enhances privacy. Although miners and node operators need to update their client, most people who hold ETH or use the network are unaffected — and ETH prices are unexpected to suffer turbulence. Maxwell Foley, software engineer at CertiK, told Cointelegraph Magazine: “Ethereum, in general, is an exciting project because they’re trying the hardest out of anyone in the crypto space to scale without sacrificing decentralization.”

There’s been some new developments after 342,000 ETH was stolen from the hot wallet of major South Korean crypto exchange Upbit. According to Whale Alert, a service monitoring large transactions, one of the addresses involved in the theft has been moving ETH worth millions of dollars to an unknown wallet. Dodgy transfers have been taking place throughout the week in chunks of 10,000 ETH and 1,001 ETH — worth about $1.5 million and $150,000 respectively. After news emerged that the funds, worth about $50 million, had been stolen, some analysts suggested that an “inside job” was more likely than an external breach.

The Bank of France is going to test a central bank digital currency for financial institutions in the first quarter of 2020. Governor François Villeroy de Galhau said the “digital euro” pilot will not involve retail payments made by individuals — and stressed any such project would “be subject to special vigilance.” The central bank has been clear that France needs to assert sovereignty over private initiatives such as Facebook’s Libra, with the country leading efforts to ensure that the stablecoin is stopped from launching on European soil. The governor has also spoken of his enthusiasm for being the first country in the world to issue a CBDC, allowing France to become an example to other jurisdictions.

Given we are, er, Hodler’s Digest, let’s give you some holding news. New research has suggested that a whopping 60% of BTC in circulation hasn’t left its wallet in more than a year. This is particularly telling since BTC/USD ballooned from lows of $3,100 last December to $13,800 just six months later. Markets subsequently reversed downward — shaving 52% off their highs. Rhythm, the analyst who uploaded the statistics, didn’t mince his words by saying: “Hodlers of last resort are insane.” With the trend of dormant BTC as a percentage of total supply sharply increasing in recent years — and remaining intact during bull and bear markets alike — it seems many investors want to save it rather than spend it.

New research by Deutsche Bank has revealed what the future might look like for crypto in just 10 short years. Its report suggests that digital currencies could eventually replace cash one day, as demand for anonymity and a more decentralized means of payment grows. Hurdles do lie in the way — and the authors say digital assets will need to gain legitimacy in the eyes of governments and regulators for wider acceptance to be achieved. The report also warns that the risk of cyberattacks and digital warfare could also pose huge risks to the stability of financial systems based on digital currencies in the future.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $7,602.68, Ether at $150.47 and XRP at $0.23. The total market cap is at $205,799,442,442.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are Energi, HedgeTrade and Enjin Coin. The top three altcoin losers of the week are ILCoin, Silverway and Thunder Token.

“Hodlers of last resort are insane.” Rhythm, analyst

“Chair Powell and I have discussed this — we both agree that in the near future, in the next five years, we see no need for the Fed to issue a digital currency.” Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury Secretary

Prediction of the Week

Halving will be “non-event” for BTC price, Morgan Creek Digital exec says

“The halvening” in May 2020 — when the reward paid to miners falls from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC per block — is widely regarded as an event that will catalyze a bull market. But according to Jason Williams, the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, these expectations might be overblown. He believes that the having will have no impact whatsoever on BTC prices, describing it as a “non-event.” With analysts bitterly divided over whether there will be a bull run — and if so, how quickly a reaction will take place — expect many more wild predictions to grace this column in the weeks and months to come.

FUD of the Week

Great North Data, a crypto mining company based in Canada, has filed for bankruptcy. The firm operated facilities in Labrador City and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Bankruptcy documents show that it had $13.2 million in liabilities but just $3.5 million in assets. Reports suggest that the company owed six-figure sums to government bodies. It’s been a difficult time for mining companies, with Washington-based Giga Watt closing down in January because it was “insolvent and unable to pay its debts when due.”

Security researchers have uncovered cryptocurrency-related macOS malware that is believed to be the work of North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus Group. It is believed that the malware can retrieve a payload from a remote location and run it in memory — something that is not common for macOS. This resultantly means it can be difficult to detect the malware and carry out forensic analysis — with only 10 antivirus engines actually flagging it as malicious. “Clear overlaps” have also been found with malware that was detected by another group of security researchers in the middle of October.

Was it funny or just ‘sexist garbage’?

Blockstream CSO Samson Mow has taken aim at a meme posted by Twitter user Davis (@Karbonbased), saying the post “crosses a line” and is “sexist garbage”.

The offending post features an image of Mow lovingly clutching a Transformers toy box, juxtaposed with an image of his partner Lina Seiche posing with a muscle bound friend at the gym.

The text reads: ‘You vs the guy she tells you not to worry about’ and is a spin on a popular internet meme dating back to 2015.

Mow wrote: “At first glance it’s funny. Lots of likes. But it’s actually very sexist and creepy AF. This guy Davis has been harassing Lina for months and stalks her social media. I don’t mind getting memed and poked fun at … but this post crosses a line.”

It’s the second Crypto Twitterstorm over social justice this week, after podcaster Andreas Antonopoulos received a torrent of criticism for merely suggesting he wanted to appear on some podcasts that weren’t hosted by white male Americans.

At first glance this looks funny. Lots of likes. But it’s actually very sexist & creepy AF. This guy Davis has been harassing Lina for months & stalks her social media. I don’t mind getting memed & poked fun at (after r/btc, this is nothing), but this post crosses a line. Thread. pic.twitter.com/Kxr96P2zfB — Samson Mow (@Excellion) December 7, 2019

Huh? What is sexist?

Mow’s salvo sparked a heated debate and more than a little puzzlement from some Twitter users who said they couldn’t actually work out what was supposed to be misogynistic.

“Can someone explain what is sexist here?” asked CryptoDeleted.

“It’s not sexist. It’s not creepy. You just got memed. Hard,” wrote Crypto Bitlord, who suggested Mow had resorted to playing the “racism, sexism, hate speech card’ after being “memed so hard.”

Mow blocked him and numerous others during the debate.

Thinly veiled message in the meme

The Blockstream CEO outlined his thought process further in subsequent tweets

“The meme is a common one. But Davis has to add an extra misogynistic spin to it, digging up an old photo of Lina and her gym friend. The not so thinly veiled message he’s sending is ‘she’s shallow and easy’.

The debate continued over the weekend with many suggesting a) Mow had invited the criticism by often posting about their relationship online (Mow said that was akin to victim blaming) and b) that it was ironic that a self declared ‘toxic maximalist’ would act morally superior.

Santsiri said “With all respect, you should reflect on this. Your Twitter content is plagued with snarky memes and you brag about being toxic. This is how toxicity feels in the receiving end’

PS There’s nothing sexist in a joke like that, only poking fun on a nerd.”

He was also blocked.

Support for Mow

Mow’s partner Lina Seiche, the Global Marketing Director for BTSE.com, weighed in to support him.

“Sad to see some of the responses,” she wrote.

“There’s no misunderstanding the original tweet. It’s intentionally sexist. If you find that funny, so be it. But if you think it’s funny to attack or ridicule Samson for calling out the tweet’s sexist nature, you’re just as bad, if not worse.”

Mow was also supported by prominent Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack and others.

“Someone posted a pic of my wife with this same caption I would bitch slap him on stage at the next conference,” wrote Twobitidiot.

“Out of context the meme was humorous, but understanding the harassment, it’s just sad. Sorry that you both have to deal with him,” MrCoolBp wrote.

After my initial tweet someone DM’d me saying my post would draw more attention. That was the goal: to bring attention to sexist and creepy behavior so it’s discouraged, and make people actually think about something instead of allowing it because “it’s just a meme dude.” — Samson Mow (@Excellion) December 7, 2019

Davis denies stalking and harrassment

Davis denied the accusations of stalking and harassment and challenged Mow to provide evidence he had done so.

He responded to the furore by doubling down with yet another meme, posting a photoshopped picture of a sale of commemorative baseball caps. They feature Mow holding up a sign saying ‘It’s sexist’.

‘The #It’sSexist hat you’ve all been waiting for. Making memes? Well, you’re sexist…. Getting roasted only but insecure as f—? Kinda sexist. Can dish it but can’t take it? Super sexist.”

He also retweeted a post by @nixops which said: “If memes and words upset you, you aren’t ready for a censorship-free internet.”

Whether it’s traders predicting great things for a digital token that’s set to launch, or a journalist touting the next groundbreaking Web3 project, future-gazing is a popular pastime.

With so many crypto projects in the offing, and so many supposed psychics pulling you in different directions, it can be tough to know who or what to believe. Even studious observers of the cryptoeconomy have difficulty reaching consensus on the next sure thing. If 2019 has been any indication, however, the following projects are likely to generate even bigger waves in 2020

Saga

Saga is a highly ambitious monetary venture which seeks to position its digital token, SGA, as a truly global currency. The UK-based company has been tirelessly working on perfecting and polishing its monetary and governance models for the past two years ahead of the ERC20 token launch on December 10. Initially backed by a basket of national currencies replicating the IMF’s SDR, the idea is that, as user trust in SGA grows, reliance upon reserves will decrease and SGA will, as it were, stand on its own two feet.

The industry experience of the Saga team certainly nourishes the perception that the project may launch into the stratosphere. Its advisory board includes Professor Jacob A. Frenkel, PhD, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and former governor of the Bank of Israel, and Professor Myron Scholes, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. With such economic heavyweights behind it, Saga has already attracted $30m of seed funding from a collective of partners including Vertex Ventures. Watch this space.

Fetch.ai

An AI-powered blockchain that launched in 2019, Fetch allows organizations to pose questions about datasets residing on other companies’ servers; payments, meanwhile, will be made with digital tokens. In the Fetch model, Autonomous Economic Agents (AEA) are utilized to connect IoT devices and algorithms, with the net result a form of collective super-intelligence built atop a decentralized economic internet. Got that?

Fetch recently set to work developing a decentralized metals exchange with several Turkish steelmakers. The new DEX will integrate AI-accelerated blockchain solutions to facilitate greater participation and improved liquidity in the trading of steel, base metals and other commodities. It’s yet another example of blockchain/AI tech feeding into traditional industries, and when you consider that Fetch’s goal is to bring smart cities from concept to reality – improving infrastructure like energy utility grids in the process – you can’t help but think 2020 is going to be a massive year for the crypto project.

RSK

RSK is an open-source, Bitcoin-backed smart contract platform. Encompassing multiple components including the Root Infrastructure Framework Token (RIF Token), RIF Open Standard (RIFOS), and Smart Bitcoin (RBTC), the second-layer protocol seeks to become a key player in the development of Bitcoin-anchored decentralized finance, permitting smart contracts and dApps to utilize the ecosystem’s renowned security.

Its parent company, IOV Labs, also acquired Latin America’s biggest social media platform Taringa, and it’ll be fascinating to see what implementations are introduced in the next 12 months. With 30 million users, Taringa has a ready made community for experiencing the benefits of decentralized finance, including open access and trustless trade, wrapped in a user-friendly interface courtesy of RSK’s smart contract solution.

QAN

The threat of quantum computing is certain to intensify in the years ahead. Hell, Google says they’ve already reached quantum supremacy in 2019. In any case, quantum-proof blockchain platform QAN stands in a good position to capitalize. It uses sophisticated Lattice cryptography to future-proof against quantum cyber attacks which could break existing blockchain platforms like Ethereum. The result is a highly scalable, developer-friendly platform that can run smart contracts in all major programming languages.

QAN uses a Proof-of-Randomness (PoR) consensus to ensure low energy consumption and is 100x quicker than Ethereum, with a TPS of 97k for enterprise (POA) chains. The team has been busy shouting about QAN’s many benefits at various crypto events throughout 2019, so expect more of the same in 2020. Particularly since QAN’s IEO is due to commence soon on BitBay exchange, bringing its token to a wider audience of traders and developers.

There you have it: four innovative projects making plenty of noise in the cryptosphere, and unlikely to lower their pitch in 2020. You’d do well to keep tabs on all of them.

But after months of sustained selling, crypto analysts have begun to watch for signs a bottom may be forming, and according to one prominent trader, Bitcoin price charts are showing a pattern that holds an “uncanny resemblance” to Bitcoin’s bear market bottoming pattern from the start of the year.

Bitcoin Price Action Shows Resemblance to Bear Market Bottom

Nearly one year ago in December 2018, Bitcoin price reached its bear market low of $3,150 just a month after critical support at $6,000 gave way, and a violent drop took the crypto asset into the deepest depths of crypto winter.

The leading crypto asset by market cap spent the first three months of the year building a base pattern, giving traders and investors confidence that a bottom could be forming, and the asset would soon return to a bull market.

Eventually, Bitcoin exploded out of that bottom, rallying over 350% until it reached resistance at $14,000, where it was rejected, causing a reversal that has resulted in months of a downtrend. However, the downtrend may soon be coming to an end, as Bitcoin is once again showing signs that a strong base is building, and a reversal could soon be ahead.

In fact, the current price action across crypto markets very closely resembles the price action at Bitcoin’s bear market bottom. According to one crypto trader, the resemblance is “uncanny” and makes “sense” that the first major correction after Bitcoin’s first major move up would result in an accumulation period that resembled the initial phase.

There is an uncanny resemblance between these two charts. It would make sense that after the first major move up, that the first major correction and following accumulation period would have a fractal resemblance to the larger original. The purpose is still the same.$BTC pic.twitter.com/eRQA9PRJSZ — Cantering Clark (@CanteringClark) December 9, 2019

Each phase’s purpose would be to allow high-wealth, “smart money” investors to load up on the asset at the lowest prices possible before a markup phase begins and the asset’s price is propelled higher and higher – much like what happened from April through early July.

Once Bitcoin began its rally earlier this year, much of the crypto market had been confident that the first-ever cryptocurrency was returning to bull mode, and about to embark on the greatest bull market the world has ever seen. But a deep correction quickly turned the exuberance to fear.

In the days ahead, if Bitcoin can continue to form a base and bottom at current prices, moving into a bull market may be possible. However, if Bitcoin price continues to crash, the asset’s first true bear market may be ahead – one that could put the future of the emerging asset class in jeopardy of being dead before it has ever truly arrived.",2019-12-09 17:00:05+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korea-govt-seeks-to-tax-crypto-transactions-as-capital-gains,"The South Korean government plans to tax capital gains on cryptocurrency transactions. A Dec. 9 report from The Korea Times reveals that a revised bill to introduce the measure will be drawn up by the country’s Ministry of Economy and Finance by the first half of 2020.

In parallel, the Korean National Assembly is in the process of advancing a related bill aimed at increasing transparency in cryptocurrency trading. If passed, the new regulations would come into effect one year after the Assembly’s plenary session.

While the government’s capital gains bill will reportedly go ahead regardless of related legislation, The Korea Times notes that a more adequate definition of cryptocurrencies and digital assets will be required to provide clarity for the government’s interventions.

Among the matters to be clarified is the question of whether crypto-related gains are to be deemed similar to gains in stock trading or real estate transactions.

To implement its taxation plans, the government could therefore need to obtain access to trading records on cryptocurrency exchanges — a practice already underway in countries such as the United States.

Anti-Money Laundering measures

As Cointelegraph reported, South Korea’s proposed Act on Reporting and Use of Certain Financial Transaction Information will, if passed, stipulate that banks must issue real-name accounts to crypto exchanges. This would ensure that crypto exchanges adhere to the same Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering standards as traditional financial institutions.

This move to bring cryptocurrency exchanges under the direct regulation of the country’s watchdog, the Financial Services Commission, will also include introducing a crypto exchange licensing system, as recommended by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Major South Korean exchange Upbit, which is run by a subsidiary of Korean tech giant Kakao, revealed last month that 342,000 Ether (ETH) had been stolen from its hot wallets.

The thefts happened when the exchange was allegedly moving assets between its hot and cold storage facilities, sparking some speculation that the incident may have been an inside job, rather than an external breach. Upbit has pledged to reimburse those affected from its corporate funds.

Transfers of the ill-gotten assets have since been detected on the Ethereum blockchain.",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-okex-launching-options-trading-later-this-month,"OKEx is adding cryptocurrency options to its existing offerings of spot and futures trading.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has finalized and put in use a new tax form that requires crypto owners to declare whether they received, bought, sold, exchanged, or acquired any cryptocurrencies in 2019. Tax experts are frustrated at the vagueness of the tax agency, with some questioning whether the answers would increase the chances of being audited by the IRS.

New Tax Form With Crypto Question

The IRS published a new tax form containing a question about cryptocurrency on Thursday. The Schedule 1 form is part of the 1040 tax form for U.S. taxpayers to declare “Additional Income and Adjustments to Income.” The IRS first unveiled the draft of this form in October, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. The form is now finalized and posted on the IRS website for use in filing 2019 tax returns. Form 1040 is used by over 152 million U.S. tax filers. The first question on the new Schedule 1 reads:

At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?

What Will the IRS Do?

The crypto question at the beginning of the new tax form has the crypto community guessing the IRS’ intention, what it will do with the information, and what exactly needs to be declared. A tax expert told CNBC that “The inquiry itself is a vague one.”

Sarah-Jane Morin, a partner at Morgan Lewis in San Francisco, told the publication, “As a taxpayer myself, I find this question very frustrating because it isn’t clear.” She pointed out that moving one’s own cryptocurrency from one wallet to another could be considered “sending.” Morin concluded that “The most conservative approach that a taxpayer can take is to consider any interaction you’ve had with virtual currency and whether there’s any way this can fall under this very broad list of what you could’ve engaged in during 2019.”

Jeffrey Levine, a CPA and director of financial planning at Blueprint Wealth Alliance in New York, was quoted by the news outlet as saying:

The biggest thing is that the IRS is asking this for a reason, and my question is how much have you increased your audit risk by checking ‘Yes’ in response?

The IRS has a history of being vague when it comes to taxing crypto transactions. The agency released new tax guidelines in October to supplement its previous guidance issued in 2014. However, while the new guidance answers some questions, it also raises several more, especially regarding how hard forks and airdrops are taxed. In November, two attorneys in the IRS Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Income Tax and Accounting) attempted to answer some questions regarding hard forks and like-kind exchanges.

IRS Increases Focus on Crypto

The IRS has been increasing its efforts to find and tax crypto owners. The agency’s Criminal Investigation Annual Report 2019 released last week outlines its efforts and progress in finding and convicting crypto tax evaders. The IRS wrote:

Cryptocurrencies are undermining the financial and tax system.

“Companies pay employees in cryptocurrency or receive crypto for goods/services,” the tax agency continued. “They do not pay taxes and entities shift income to offshore exchanges with no reporting requirements, utilizing exchanges with little to no AML practices.” The IRS added, “Understanding the advancements in this area and staying on top of the criminal methodologies is our bread and butter.”

While admitting that its resources are limited, the IRS believes that it has the tools and ability to find crypto tax evaders. Cyber criminals “now deal in cryptocurrency, again thinking this will make them anonymous, but our agents have once again proved that there is nowhere to hide. We will not stop in our pursuit,” the report reads. In July, the tax agency sent more than 10,000 letters to crypto users reminding them of their tax obligations.

The IRS’ report also highlights the achievements of its collaboration with international partners, the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement or J5. The group comprises the IRS Criminal Investigation and its counterparts in the U.K., Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands. The J5 focuses on international tax evasion including the use of cryptocurrency to evade international tax obligations. The IRS further wrote:

In just 18-months, we are already seeing the benefits to this group both in the development of new tools and in the numbering of real cases. We expect our first operational results from this group in FY20.

According to an announcement on Dec. 9, Bakkt is now using its physically settled Bitcoin contracts as a benchmark to build complementary products.

Bakkt’s monthly futures contract will be a benchmark for other new products

The news was announced in a blog post by Bakkt COO Adam White. The post reads:

“By starting with the physically delivered Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures, we have a benchmark contract that provides the foundation for us to develop complementary products based on the needs of our customers.”

First Bitcoin options regulated by the CFTC

The two new products include Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Options and Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Cash-Settled Futures.

According to the post, the Bakkt’s monthly options product is the first regulated Bitcoin futures contract regulated by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Price discovery occurs within a federally regulated market and has no exposure to unregulated Bitcoin spot markets, the announcement notes.

The cash-settled futures product is a new contract that will be initially available on ICE Futures Singapore, an approved exchange in Singapore. The contract is based on the settlement price of the benchmark Bakkt Bitcoin monthly future contract and provides an option for participants who are unable to trade our physically delivered contract, the blog post reads.

Bakkt CEO to enter the U.S. Senate

The news comes after Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler was appointed to a U.S. Senate seat. According to media reports, Loeffler will replace Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), who plans to retire at the end of the year.

Bakkt platform is one of the most promising cryptocurrency-related initiatives to date as its physically settled Bitcoin futures have become one of the most talked-about products in crypto.

While the platform reported low volumes at the launch on Sept. 23, Bakkt has continued to grow, gradually gaining momentum on crypto markets. As such, On Dec. 3, Bitcoin futures open interest on Bakkt hit another all-time high of $6.5 million. In late November, Cointelegraph reported on another record for Bitcoin futures trading on Bakkt, which accounted for 5,600 BTC on the day.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies-derivatives-idUSKBN1YE0KA,"LONDON (Reuters) - The old image of bitcoin miners is of young techies in their bedrooms, hunched over laptops that solve maths puzzles to earn new coins. Now they’re more likely to be savvy startups with ultra-high-speed chips and massive, power-guzzling machines.

And, in a new development, they’re beginning to look to financial derivatives to hedge against the wild swings in their electricity needs that can turn profits to dust.

The growth of a market for such tools could accelerate investment in cryptocurrency mining, originally the preserve of lone enthusiasts but now a capital-intensive industry that is expected to see growing demand for digital coins.

Crypto miners must draw on increasingly large amounts of computing power as they compete against others to solve the complex mathematical equations to build the blockchain and earn rewards in the form of new digital coins.

Startups have largely been defenseless against changes in so-called “hashrate” - in short, a fluctuating measure of the processing power of the entire bitcoin network that dictates how much power miners need to produce new coins.

A spike in hashrate means more electricity is required, ramping up production costs and eating into eventual profits of coins sold. This wildcard could become a major obstacle for startups to attract much-needed investment from institutions and markets.

The answer, seven cryptocurrency miners and industry players told Reuters, are derivatives that allow miners to hedge the hashrate. In theory, that would give clearer projections of cashflow - a prerequisite for would-be investors.

The miners and crypto traders, spread from the United States and Canada to Britain and Hong Kong, said a market for such products, though in a very early form, was emerging and would grow in importance.

“The trend in hashrate is upwards. Unless miners increase production, they will get fewer bitcoin with the same power,” said Michel Rauchs, author of a Cambridge university study on cryptocurrency miners.

“With hashrate derivatives, they can price in risk.”

London-based DAG Global, which pitches itself as a cryptocurrency merchant bank, said miners were showing strong interest in the firm’s products for hedging hashrates.

“As the hashrate changes, you can go from being profitable to losing money very quickly,” said Robert Andersen, who leads DAG’s digital asset sales. “The contract insures you against that. It’s like insurance, and for that you pay a premium.”

Another firm, crypto trader GSR, said it has been working on similar products but, given the early stage of the market, was not yet ready to offer them.

“We’re building products around hashrate and difficulty,” said co-founder Richard Rosenblum.

“It’s going to take more than a few months for there to be significant liquidity,” he said, cautioning that a market could take a few years to develop.

And for sure, the market is at a very early stage. Firm figures are hard to come by, but some crypto players say it likely totals around $50-$100 million dollars a year.

WINNING OVER INVESTORS

For traditional investors, hunting high-yielding returns in an era of ultra-low interest rates, crypto miners could offer a tempting proposition.

With bitcoin trading at around $7,500, the 1,800 bitcoin that can be produced on any given day equates to an annual market of around $5 billion a year.

And many investors want a slice.

In an major example of a crypto mining company going public, last month Chinese giant Canaan launched a $90 million initial public offering on the Nasdaq, valuing the firm at around $2 billion.

While this is an indication of capital market appetite, Canaan is one of only a handful of giant, global crypto miners. Many others are smaller outfits that would likely have to work harder to convince investors they can manage their risks.

Still, said Marco Krohn, co-founder of Hong Kong-based Genesis Mining, which produces bitcoin from Iceland to Kazakhstan, hundreds of millions of investment dollars could be up for grabs.

“You need to leverage the traditional financial markets - and these people ask questions. They tend to be risk averse.”

To attract such investors, mining firms told Reuters they are looking more closely at controlling their risks - both on hashrates and prices - via financial tools.

“The adoption of derivatives in the mining community has definitely increased in recent months,” said Kevin Shao, a manager at Canaan’s blockchain unit, speaking through an interpreter.

It may be early days for crypto mining hedging tools, but changes are definitely afoot, said U.S. firm BitOoda, which has since April brokered a product known as a “difficulty swap”.

Sam Doctor, the company’s chief strategist, said the market for such products was growing more liquid, with the length of contracts also on the rise.

“There are more players on the sidelines watching how these trades perform before they take the step of trading themselves.”",2019-12-10 07:06:16+00:00,https://dailyhodl.com/crypto-analyst-calls-big-bitcoin-breakout-in-three-days-btc-xrp-ripple-litecoin-newsflash/,"‎‎‎ ‏‏‎

From Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory to Ripple’s push to bring blockchain to academia, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

A crypto analyst known in the industry as The Cryptomist says Bitcoin may be poised for a big breakout.

In a series of tweets to her 43,000 followers, the analyst says BTC appears to be in an ascending triangle and could breakout in a matter of days.

“A possible ascending triangle to look out for Like I have been saying for the past week and a bit. I am favoring longs right now, (however, possibility of one more move down for bears)…

ADVERTISEMENT

Targets from last week remain the same:

– 7700

– 8450

– 9400

Not long now.”

Meanwhile, a fellow analyst who goes by the name Magic is far more bearish.

Although the analyst agrees that BTC may move to the upside in the short term, Magic tells his crew of 31,000 followers that the leading cryptocurrency will remain locked in a retracement for the foreseeable future.

“BTC and the others may try for an upside breakout in the coming days. However, if BTC puts in yet another lower high, it will likely breakdown below the recently contested critical support at 7250.

We may see a short term reversal, but BTC remains in a bear market downtrend.”

Ripple and XRP

The University of Texas at Austin says it’s looking to hand out grants to faculty members and graduate students who want to launch research projects centered on blockchain and cryptocurrency.

The program is backed by Ripple, which partnered with the university in November of last year to accelerate the understanding of blockchain in academia.

“The funding is made available through a generous gift made by Ripple Labs Inc.

Students and faculty members receiving funding from the initiative shall hold the title of ‘Ripple Graduate Fellow’ and ‘Ripple Fellow,’ respectively, during the funding period, and acknowledge the grant from the Blockchain Initiative at Texas McCombs in their research papers.”

Litecoin

Litecoin creator Charlie Lee says there are multiple reasons why LTC is a necessary and important crypto asset.

In a new interview on the Let’s Talk Bitcoin podcast, Lee spotlights the coin’s biggest strengths and its overall liquidity.

“So with shorter blocktimes and cheaper fees [than Bitcoin], it’s quite good for payments and people use it quite a bit. And it’s also good for testing new stuff. Litecoin’s market cap is a lot smaller than Bitcoin’s. So we can take a little bit more risk and do stuff that potentially Bitcoin would be too conservative to do…

These network protocols, currencies – they have a network effect. So if everyone’s using it, you want to be using the one with the most liquidity, the one that’s on all the exchanges that you can easily switch back between fiat and cryptocurrency. So Litecoin benefits from that because, for example, the Chinese exchanges all added Litecoin as a second cryptocurrency.

And Litecoin now is on pretty much every single exchange. So it’s very easy for anyone, anywhere to move their money to Litecoin and obviously Bitcoin. So that helps a lot for onboarding new users. And that definitely has a network effect. Once you’re supported by all the exchanges – for example, two-thirds of the Bitcoin ATMs support Litecoin because it’s easy to implement and it’s supported everywhere.”

At a hearing over Nvidia’s motion to dismiss in Oakland, California, the firm said Friday that shareholders had “cherry-picked” some company statements in an attempt to show that it had not been transparent over how much of its sales were due to miners, while ignoring others.

The case comprises consolidated shareholder lawsuits first brought in December 2018, after its revenues dipped and stock slumped by 29 percent, Law360 reports.

The shareholders allege that Nvidia had not been clear that its gaming segment still included a good volume of miner revenue, even after it launched a dedicated mining card, the Crypto SKU. That was only acknowledged by Nvidia in August 2018 after gaming revenue slumped, they claim.

Nvidia’s legal counsel – Patrick E. Gibbs of law firm Cooley LLP – said the investors’ case was not valid as they had not provided any evidence that Nvidia had known about the facts as presented in the suit, and had also not shown any connection between the stock price losses and the allegations.

“There’s not a single piece of data,” said Gibbs.

The shareholders’ legal representative argued in response that Nvidia had indicated that crypto-based revenue was low, but was actually so substantial that the company missed its expected earnings when cryptocurrency prices dropped and miner demand fell.

During the hearing, District Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. queried Nvidia over the fact that a Morgan Stanley analyst and others had appeared surprised when Nvidia stated in November 2018 that it expected revenues to decline over 7 percent.

Gibbs responded that some analysts went by the incorrect assumption that demand for gaming cards is “static.” He also argued that not all analysts responded with “same type of surprise” at the earnings forecast.",2019-12-09 16:45:00+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-09/crypto-exchange-ledgerx-places-twitter-raging-ceo-chou-on-leave,"Why did this happen?

Apparently preying on people across the globe, the scheme is understood to have operated from April 2014 until recent days from offices in New Jersey, according to an indictment signed by US Attorney Craig Carpenito.

Goettsche and Weeks were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, while Abel and Weeks were charged with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities.

Detectives confirmed they are still conducting a manhunt for two further defendants whose identities are being withheld.

“The indictment describes the defendants’ use of the complex world of cryptocurrency to take advantage of unsuspecting investors,” Carpenito said.

“What they allegedly did amounts to little more than a modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of millions of dollars.

“Working with our law enforcement partners here and across the country, we will ensure that these scammers are held to account for their crimes.”

Hoodwink

FBI officers spearheading the investigation claim the gang were using an array of complex methods to hoodwink victims into believing they were part of a get-rich-quick club.

“Those arrested today are accused of deploying elaborate tactics to lure thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a Bitcoin mining pool – an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,” Paul Delacourt, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office said.

Story continues

“The defendants allegedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing to recruit new investors over several years while spending victims’ money lavishly.”

The arrested trio will appear at courts within the county of their arrest for initial hearings in the coming weeks.

“Today’s indictment alleges the defendants were involved in a sophisticated Ponzi scheme involving hundreds of millions of dollars that preyed upon investors all over the world,” John R Tafur, Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Newark Field Office, said.

“This was a classic con game with a virtual twist – false promises of large returns for investing in the mining of Bitcoin. IRS Criminal Investigation will continue to work with our law enforcement partners, including the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement, to investigate and bring to justice cyber criminals.”

According to documents filed in the case and statements made in court, it is understood that:

“…from April 2014 through December 2019, the defendants operated BitClub Network, a fraudulent scheme that solicited money from investors in exchange for shares of purported cryptocurrency mining pools and rewarded investors for recruiting new investors.

“Goettsche, Weeks, and others conspired to solicit investments in BitClub Network by providing false and misleading figures that BitClub investors were told were “Bitcoin mining earnings,” purportedly generated by BitClub Network’s Bitcoin mining pool.”

‘Dumb’ investors

Accounts allege that Goettsche discussed with his conspirators that their target audience would be “dumb” investors, referred to them as “sheep,” and said he was “building this whole model on the backs of idiots”.

The documents claim Goettsche directed others to manipulate the figures displayed as “mining earnings” during the course of the conspiracy.

For example, in February 2015, Goettsche is said to have directed another conspirator to “bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%,” to which his conspirator warned “that is not sustainable, that is ponzi teritori [sic] and fast cash-out ponzi . . . but sure.”

In September 2017, Goettsche sent an email to another conspirator in which he suggested that Bitclub Network “[d]rop mining earnings significantly starting now” so that he could “retire RAF!!! (rich as f**k).”

Weeks sent an email in June 2017 to Goettsche and another conspirator in which he remarked that BitClub selling shares in BitClub and then not using the money to purchase mining equipment was “not right”.

Goettsche, Weeks, Abel, and others are also said to have conspired to sell BitClub Network shares – which were securities – notwithstanding that BitClub Network did not register the shares with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Weeks and Abel created videos and travelled around the United States and the world to promote BitClub Network. In one video, a conspirator espoused that the BitClub Network was “the most transparent company in the history of the world that I’ve ever seen”. In another video, Abel assured investors that BitClub Network was “too big to fail”.

Maximum penalty

The wire fraud conspiracy charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison, and a fine of up to $250,000. The conspiracy to sell unregistered securities charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine up to $250,000.

Anyone who believes they may be a victim of the alleged BitClub fraud is asked to visit www.justice.gov/usao-nj/bitclub or the Department of Justice’s large case website www.justice.gov/largecases. There, victims can find more information about the case, including a questionnaire for victims to fill out and submit.

The US government is represented by Unit Chief David W Feder and Assistant US Attorneys Anthony P Torntore and Jamie L Hoxie of the Cybercrime Unit, and Unit Chief Sarah Devlin of the Asset Recovery and Money Laundering Unit of the US Attorney’s Office in Newark.

The Justice Department stressed that charges and allegations contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

News of yet another potential crypto fraud comes only weeks after former attorney Mark Scott was found guilty for his role in the $4bn OneCoin scam. The lawyer faces the possibility of a lifetime in jail at his sentencing in February while the scheme’s founder – 38-year-old Bulgarian Ruja Ignatova – remains at large after fleeing authorities in 2017.

The post Cryptocurrency rocked by massive Bitcoin fraud appeared first on Coin Rivet.",,https://www.wired.com/story/alleged-bitcoin-scam-like-pyramid-scheme/,"The world of cryptocurrency has no shortage of imaginary investment products. Fake coins. Fake blockchain services. Fake cryptocurrency exchanges. Now five men behind a company called BitClub Network are accused of a $722 million scam that allegedly preyed on victims who thought they were investing in a pool of bitcoin mining equipment.

Federal prosecutors call the case a “high-tech” plot in the “complex world of cryptocurrency.” But it has all the hallmarks of a classic pyramid scheme, albeit with a crypto-centric conceit. Investors were invited to send BitClub Network cash, which would allow the company to buy mining equipment—machines that produce bitcoin through a process called hashing. When those machines were turned on, all would (in theory) enjoy the spoils. The company also allegedly gave rewards to existing investors in exchange for recruiting others to join. According to the complaint, the scheme began in April 2014 and continued until earlier this month.

Matthew Brent Goettsche, Jobadiah Sinclair Weeks, and Silviu Catalin Balaci are accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. A fourth defendant, Joseph Frank Abel, faces only the latter charge. Another unnamed defendant remains at large. Balaci’s name was redacted from one public version of the indictment, but appeared on another.

The scheme appears to have started as a relatively modest scam and spiraled dramatically in ambition. Internal messages between the conspirators give the impression of growing glee at the ease of taking advantage of investors, referring to “building this whole model on the backs of idiots.” The men allegedly described their victims as “dumb” investors and “sheep.”

“They were not wrong,” Emin Gun Sirer, the CEO of blockchain startup Ava Labs, quipped on Twitter.

In October 2014, a few months after BitClub Network was founded, Goettsche allegedly posted about the need to “fak[e] it for the first 30 days while we get going,” instructing a co-conspirator to do some “magic” on the company’s revenue numbers. They allegedly agreed on a method of cooking the numbers that would include inconsistencies to make sure they appeared real. The tricks swiftly became more daring. Later, Goettsche allegedly suggested the company “bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%.”

LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Bitcoin

“That is not sustainable, that is ponzi teritori [sic] and fast cash-out ponzi . . . but sure,” Balaci responded, according to messages included in the indictment. A September 2017 email from Goettsche allegedly suggested the company “[d]rop mining earnings significantly starting now” so that he could “retire RAF!!! (rich as fuck).”

The defendants also allegedly sold shares of the company in violation of securities law, traveling around the world with marketing materials that touted the company as “transparent” and “too big to fail.” (The BitClub website now has a disclaimer saying investments are not available to investors in the US or the Philippines.) At one point, one of the defendants appeared to express remorse, referring to selling shares in BitClub without using the money to purchase mining equipment as “not right.”

The identities of the alleged victims are unclear, but there are hints in still-online videos and advertisements that the company had wide reach. In one ad, appearing on the website of Ben Franklin Technology Partners, a nonprofit investment firm affiliated with the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development, a company calling itself BitClub Network promotes “Founder” status for people who agree to purchase shares in four purported mining pools. The going rate was $1,000 per “GPU share,” a unit of measure that isn’t illuminated in the marketing materials. (Ben Franklin did not respond to an after-hours request for comment).",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/three-men-arrested-for-running-alleged-722-million-crypto-ponzi-scheme,"United States authorities in New Jersey have announced the arrest of three men who are accused of defrauding investors of over $722 million as part of alleged crypto ponzie scheme BitClub Network, per a Dec. 10 announcement from the Department of Justice.

The accusations against BitClub Network

According to the press release, BitClub Network promised massive rates of return in exchange for investments in a shared cryptocurrency mining pool. The parties at the center of the scheme then allegedly misappropriated over $722 million of those funds into their own lavish living rather than the promised mining pool.

Authorities further accuse the three men arrested of falsifying information on returns in order to solicit more investment as well as

The three accused are Matthew Goettsche and Jobadiah Weeks — both from Colorado — and Joseph Abel of California. Authorities are charging the first two with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, as well as conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. Abel, who was apparently less central to the scheme, has only been charged with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities, a charge that carries a maximum prison term of 5 years.

The press release mentions additional conspirators who have not been named or charged with crimes.

A suspicious history

This is not the first indication that BitClub may not be a fully above-board operation. Back in 2016, crypto news outlet 99Bitcoins warned against investing in BitClub, despite removing an earlier “scam” label from the company. The author, Ofir Beigel, explained:

“After gathering the facts I can’t prove that Bitclub network is a scam beyond a shadow of a doubt. I do however still think that Bitclub Network’s business model is lacking and wouldn’t invest in it personally.”

Back in March of 2017, Cointelegraph reported on accusations that BitClub had launched a malleability attack on the Bitcoin (BTC) network.

Ongoing legal action against OneCoin

Arguably the most famous crypto exit scam in history, the case of OneCoin has seen notable recent legal action. In November, a jury in Manhattan found an attorney guilty of laundering over $400 million on behalf of OneCoin’s famed founder Ruja Ignatova, also known as the Cryptoqueen. For his services, he was allegedly paid $50 million.

Ignatova’s location remains unknown. Only last week, OneCoin’s website finally went offline, having helped the scheme garner $4 billion.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/china-releases-year-end-crypto-rankings/,"China Releases Year-End Crypto Rankings

China’s Center for Information and Industry Development has published its year-end crypto project rankings. Thirty-five projects were evaluated and ranked overall as well as in three separate categories. Bitcoin has risen in ranking while EOS remains China’s favorite.

Year-End Crypto Rankings

The Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID), under China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, released the 15th update of its crypto project rankings on Friday. While the hype for blockchain technology initiated by President Xi Jinping has somewhat subsided, the center continues its work on evaluating and ranking crypto projects. This month’s release is the last one this year. The center evaluated the same 35 projects in December as it did for the previous rankings in September.

In addition to the overall ranking, the CCID evaluated all the projects based on their basic technology, applicability, and creativity. EOS remains at the top of the overall ranking, followed by Ethereum and then Tron. The center started ranking Tron in February, debuting it at number two overall. However, in July, it dropped to the third place and Ethereum regained its number two ranking. In September, Tron overtook Ethereum once again but only to fall to the third place once more this month. NULS ranks fourth, followed by Lisk, Neo, Steem, and Bitshares. BTC has risen from the 11th spot to the 9th spot. BCH also improved, rising from the 30th spot to the 27th spot.

The CCID describes itself as “a first-class scientific research institution directly under the administration of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China.” It provides professional services to the government including research, consulting, evaluation, certification, and research and development, according to its website. The center has been working on its Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index since the beginning of last year. The rankings are compiled by CCID (Qingdao) Blockchain Research Institute, an entity established by the CCID, in collaboration with other organizations such as the CCID Think Tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers,” the CCID previously explained.

This Month’s Sub-Rankings

The CCID explained that the basic technology sub-category mainly evaluates the technical implementation of the public chain, primarily examining its functions, performance, security, and decentralization. This month, EOS and Tron still occupy the first and second places, the center noted, adding that “The average value of the basic technology sub-index has not changed much from the previous period.”

The applicability sub-index mainly evaluates the comprehensive level of the applications that the public chain actually supports, including node deployment, wallet applications, development support, and application implementation. In this evaluation period, the center revealed that “The average value of the overall applicability index increased significantly from the previous period.” The creativity sub-index mainly examines the continuous innovation of the public chain, including the number of developers, code updates and code impact. The center noted that compared to the previous period, the average creativity sub-index has only increased slightly.

Bakkt has launched two new regulated bitcoin derivatives products. Within hours of launch, Bakkt announced that over 1,000 futures contracts had been traded in Asia. The platform now offers four types of regulated bitcoin derivatives products: monthly and daily physically delivered bitcoin futures, cash settled bitcoin futures, and options on monthly bitcoin futures.

Also read: SEC Approves Bitcoin Futures Fund

2 New Regulated Products

Bakkt, a digital asset platform powered by Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), announced Monday that its two new bitcoin derivatives products are now live. They leverage the platform’s benchmark contract, the physically delivered bitcoin monthly futures, which was launched in September.

The first of the two new products is Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Options, which settles into the underlying futures contract two days prior to expiry on ICE Futures U.S. The second is Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Cash Settled Futures, which is available on ICE Futures Singapore. “We’re live with two new bitcoin contracts — a cash settled future and options on futures — both fully regulated and leveraging our benchmark,” COO Adam White remarked Monday. After about five hours following its launch announcement, Bakkt tweeted:

Over 1,000 Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Cash Settled Futures contracts have been traded on ICE Futures Singapore since launching earlier today.

ICE unveiled its plans to launch the cash-settled futures in Singapore on Nov. 21. The contracts are listed on ICE Futures Singapore and cleared by ICE Clear Singapore, both of which are regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). “Our new cash settled futures contract will offer investors in Asia and around the world a convenient, capital efficient way to gain or hedge exposure in bitcoin markets,” commented Lucas Schmeddes, President and COO of both ICE Futures and Clear Singapore.

Rising Interest and Growing Volumes

The two newly launched products join the platform’s two existing offerings: the Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures and the Bitcoin (USD) Daily Futures. Both are supposed to be physically settled, with the underlying bitcoins held in the Bakkt Warehouse. Bakkt Trust Company Llc is licensed by the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) to provide custody of bitcoin. The “DFS has authorized Bakkt to provide custody services for bitcoin in conjunction with the launch of physically delivered bitcoin futures contracts,” the regulator said on Aug. 16. The trust company is also registered with the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen).

Despite a slow start in September, Bakkt’s futures trading volume soon picked up as BTC’s price plummeted. On Nov. 27, the platform boasted that a record high was set, tweeting:

Two months after their debut, Bakkt Bitcoin Futures reached a record high of 4,443 contracts traded today – up over 60% from our last record-setting day.

Meanwhile, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has picked Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler to replace Senator Johnny Isakson who is retiring at the end of the month. Loeffler is expected to take office on Jan. 1.

They were drawn, at least in part, by Puerto Rico’s latest batch of tax incentives–which allow anyone who moves to the territory to pay virtually no federal income or capital gains taxes. When the value of the digital currency Bitcoin surged, early investors found themselves suddenly quite rich. And these tax breaks made Puerto Rico very inviting to them. Some planned to move to the island outright, but most of them came to check CoinAgenda Caribbean, a big conference for cryptocurrency investors.

Festooned with crystals and fedoras, they don’t exactly look the part of your average financial investors—more like Burning Man attendees. Or at least, that’s the vibe of their unofficial leader, Brock Pierce, a former child star and major Bitcoin investor, said to be a billionaire.

On stage at CoinAgenda, he talked about plans he had for Puerto Rico—to help rebuild after Hurricane María, and transform Puerto Rico into a high-tech cryptocurrency paradise in the process.

The pro-business government at the time was friendly to their vision for the island, and some tech-minded young Puerto Ricans even joined up with them.

But in the months to follow, the promises to come in and change everything didn’t always go over so well with many people from the island. Soon, Pierce and the cryptocurrency enthusiasts were facing resistance and bad press at every turn. And then—Bitcoin crashed.

Reporters Joaquin Cotler and Michael O’Brien followed the trials and tribulations of the Puertopians for almost two years, from crypto-boom to crypto-bust.

Featured image by Alex Charner.",2019-12-10,https://cointelegraph.com/news/report-denmarks-tax-agency-is-sending-tax-compliance-letters-to-crypto-users,"Denmark-based cryptocurrency users have begun receiving letters from the Danish tax agency, Skattestyrelsen, requesting that traders provide a full background of all their cryptocurrency transactions, sources informed Cointelegraph on Dec. 10.

In its letters, Skattestyrelsen specifically asked crypto users to provide information about profits and losses for fiscal years 2016 to 2018, according to FIFO (First In First Out) principles. These principles represent a method of inventory valuation assuming that all goods are sold or used in the same chronological order in which consumers purchased them.

Furthermore, the tax agency asked for the rates used for each transaction, information on the purpose of acquiring digital currencies, and documentation regarding the creation of a cryptocurrency wallet.

Disclosure of crypto exchange services used

In terms of crypto exchange services, Skattestyrelsen requested that crypto consumers revealed the confirmation of their trading activity in the form of a screenshot featuring the individual’s name and an agreement on the creation of an account.

In addition to that, Skattestyrelsen wants to examine crypto consumers’ account statements from their bank accounts for the aforementioned period. Robin Singh, founder of cryptocurrency tax startup Koinly, provided Cointelegraph with the letter. Singh commented:

“Many of our Danish users have received these letters, Skat is asking for a full breakdown of all their transactions and asking them to fix all past reports as well. Filing tax on cryptocurrency trades is a difficult task as crypto traders usually hold several exchange accounts & wallets and freely transfer crypto between them, so there’s no easy way to figure out what the capital gains are for any particular trade.”

Skattestyrelsen’s first steps towards crypto user taxation

Skattestyrelsen turned its focus to crypto consumers late last year when it confirmed that it was “identifying” 2,700 individuals it said owed taxes on Bitcoin (BTC) gains. The agency intended to go after each individual with an eye to determining their payment obligations. Skattestyrelsen said at the time:

“If something does not match, we will contact them and ask for more information. However, how many people it is and what it may mean, it is still too early to say.”

In January 2019, the country’s Tax Council authorized Skattestyrelsen to obtain information on all trades of cryptocurrencies across three domestic crypto exchanges. At the time, the tax agency planned to make the first adjustments to tax treatment for specific cases based on the newly-acquired information before summer 2019.

In August, the agency received authorization to obtain information regarding cryptocurrency trading from 20,000 private individuals.

Following the U.S. IRS practice

Skattestyrelsen thus follows the United States Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) example. The IRS sent letters to 10,000 crypto investors to clarify crypto tax filing requirements and, in certain cases, compel them to pay back taxes. At the time, the IRS said that it asked some of the crypto investors to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and/or interest and penalties.

In October, the IRS added a question on crypto ownership to the standard 1040 income tax form for the coming tax season. IRS specifically asked: “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?” The question expects a straightforward yes or no, with no additional details requested.",,https://www.coindesk.com/cryptocurrency-is-most-useful-for-breaking-laws-and-social-constructs,"This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world.

Why hasn’t cryptocurrency gone mainstream?

“It doesn’t scale.”

“It’s slow.”

“It’s expensive.”

“It’s volatile.”

“It’s hard to use.”

Or maybe it was never supposed to go mainstream.

This is not to say cryptocurrency is any less important, meaningful, or useful. Rather, I think perhaps we have been judging cryptocurrencies’ success (or lack thereof) according to a false metric. We would not judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree.

By design, cryptocurrency does not solve mainstream problems.

Scale, speed, and cost are all examples of mainstream problems within finance, from main street to Wall Street. Credit card networks go down. Stock trades take days to clear. Wire transfers are expensive. In some situations, cryptocurrencies may offer marginal improvements on any of these issues, but more often blockchain-based systems will fail when compared to more conventional, centralized solutions.

This does not represent a design flaw. In fact, this is an intentional trade off. Decentralized systems forsake scale, speed, and cost in favor of one key feature: censorship resistance. Cryptocurrency solves problems faced by the censored who, by definition, are not the mainstream.

In particular, cryptocurrency enables individuals and organizations to make censored transactions. Procuring drugs on the internet. That’s an example of a censored transaction. Buying US dollars in Argentina is another example. Paying a sex worker. Sending money to a friend in Iran. Making an online purchase as an unbanked individual. Selling cannabis as a dispensary. Getting money out of Venezuela. Supporting dissidents in Hong Kong. The primary utility of cryptocurrency lies in engaging in financial activity that is otherwise suppressed or prohibited.

This is the stated intent of cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, described cryptocurrency as a tool of freedom. He compared it to other peer to peer networks like Tor which are similarly resilient to censorship. If we look at the anecdotal evidence, we can see that this is indeed how bitcoin is being used from China to Palestine. Furthermore, what little quantitative data we have also suggests that cryptocurrency use is higher in countries with financial restrictions. These results line up with predictions around cryptocurrency adoption that have existed for years. It is time to face this potentially uncomfortable reality: cryptocurrency is most useful when breaking laws and social constructs.

I, for one, do not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use.

There exists a long history of censorship resistant and privacy preserving technologies: Signal for messaging, Bittorrent for file-sharing, Tor for web browsing. Like bitcoin, these tools are not built for the mainstream. Most people would rather use faster, slicker, glossier centralized alternatives like Facebook Message, Dropbox, and Google Chrome. But for censored people and organizations, decentralized technologies have always provided an escape hatch. For as long as they have existed, these tools have brought with them a certain level of societal discomfort. This discomfort stems not from these platforms being lawless domains — regulations exist on the dark web as much as they do in any jurisdiction – but rather from the difficulty these platforms present in enforcing these government policies and social norms. These technologies render censored activities more difficult to stop.

Decentralized technologies can be used for good, for evil, and for everything in between. From Hammurabi’s Code through to the Patriot Act, the morality of laws has been a matter of debate for as long as they have existed. The laws of one jurisdiction are often deemed unethical and unacceptable by its citizens and those of other geographies. To say that cryptocurrency is used primarily to engage in illegal or socially unacceptable activities is not a normative statement. It is used by freedom fighters and terrorists, by journalists and dissidents, by scammers and black market dealers, by revolutionaries and government officials. It is used by civilians to break unjust laws and escape humanitarian crisis, and it is used by the policymakers who write those very same laws. And of course, the same statements can all be made regarding the original decentralized payment system: cash.

As an industry, we spend a lot of time considering how to drive mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. I, for one, do not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use. For if it has, that world is a very scary place indeed.

This is not to discourage or devalue any of the work that is being done to improve decentralized technologies. Many projects in the industry are working toward optimizing away shortcomings in the technology. Layer 2 protocols promise to speed things up. New consensus mechanisms and forms of sybil resistance expect to improve scalability and reduce infrastructure costs. A myriad of applications are building more user-friendly wallets, on-ramps, exchanges, and other tools. All of these developments are important but they may never result in mass adoption. Improvements in scalability, speed, cost, volatility, and user experience may, however, make the critical difference for those who are users, no matter how fringe: the young woman in Venezuela surviving on bitcoin or the Chinese businessman using Tether for cross-border trade.",2019-12-10 19:30:00+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-coolest-jobs-in-crypto/,"The Coolest Jobs in Crypto

Meme Lord. Street artist. Unique startup founder. Feeder of the hungry. There’s no end to the amount of cool jobs in crypto, and new uses for decentralized, peer-to-peer cash are limited only by the bounds of one’s imagination. Whether finding new and innovative solutions for longstanding societal or technological problems, just having fun, or both, those receiving a paycheck in digital currencies aren’t always day traders or suits doing desk work at a big firm.

Cool Money

Crypto is cool money. Peer-to-peer, decentralized and permissionless cash like bitcoin opens all sorts of opportunities for entrepreneurs, employers and employees alike. Without cumbersome banks, excessive fees and regulations standing in the way, sending and receiving payments for services is easier than ever. So is giving. While most everyone knows about the more conventional jobs in the space, this article aims to focus on the decentralized heart of crypto, where creatives and everyday individuals are leveraging the power of internet money for an unorthodox living or lifestyle.

Cool Crypto Gigs

Meme Lord

“So what do you do?”

“Oh, me? I’m a crypto meme lord.”

It’s no joke. If your dream job is to spend your days doing exactly what you do now — fighting the great meme wars of the 2010s and soon 20s — crypto makes that possible. In August, crypto swapping application Sideshift.ai was on the lookout for a “Meme Lord/Specialist.” The now expired (and ostensibly filled) job listing states the applicant would be responsible for “meme creation and related activities. If you have a ‘no idea is too spicy’ approach to memes and know how to push buttons, this may be the role for you.”

The posting goes on to note that his or her highness would be paid in a “cryptocurrency of [their] choice” and that hours are flexible as “Sideshift AI is focused on output.” The posting requires no resume, just the submission of a couple memes and desired hourly rate, plus a spicy meme idea for consideration.

Crypto Artist

Art and bitcoin go together like bread and butter, thanks to the openness and innovation both areas of free and permissionless human activity share. However, the pay the bills aspect when it comes to this nexus isn’t as often discussed. French artist Pboy has it down to a science. As news.Bitcoin.com reported in October, Pascal Boyart (Pboy) is not only making significant side scratch from his murals and economics-focused street art, he’s helping others to to do it too, with a bilingual, in-depth tutorial on how to attach QR codes to large murals. What’s cooler than spray-painting the town in counter-economics propaganda and getting paid for it?

Speaking, Crypto Nomadism and Other Independent Work

Cryptocurrencies can be freely traded peer-to-peer and are digital, thus there are fewer limits imposed on what enterprising minds can do to provide a service and be recompensed in the market. Whether a popular crypto vlogger and speaker like Ivan on Tech, a digital nomad traveling the world and documenting the adventure like Didi Taihuttu and the Bitcoin family, or someone with a new and useful app or startup idea, the cool of crypto is that it levels the playing field and opens opportunity to anyone with an idea and the drive to create it. Taihutti details the impetus for his choice to become a full-time crypto nomad with his family, saying:

I built up three successful companies but while doing so, I lost my mother when she was 48 and lost my father when he was 61. During these hard times in my life, I started reflecting life more and more and discovered that the life I was living was not the life I wanted to live. I experienced that Life could go very fast and that I needed to change. I sold my companies and started to travel with my family.

Everyday individuals are finding that their ideas are more readily noticeable and feasible than in times past, thanks to the decentralized nature of the crypto space and democratization the internet provides. So if you can think of the next cool concept, you’ve got more of a shot than ever to get it to market. Develop an app, give private tours of your city for crypto, or sell produce for bitcoin in your local farmer’s market. The sky’s the limit.

Giving

While not technically a “job” according to some, for serious crypto charity organizers, giving is a time-consuming commitment of passion, and can be much more involved than any typical nine to five work. Crypto has demolished many of the hurdles that once made helping others difficult — political borders, banking fees, regulations and slow transfer speeds.

Jose and Gabriel, who started the charity organization Eatbch in Venezuela, don’t make money from their initiative. The coolness of their crypto gig is in what they do. When the founders saw “people we knew since childhood reduced to begging and searching trash bags for scraps of food” they sprang into action leveraging crypto in an organic, decentralized way, and now provide food via BCH donations to people and communities in need. The operation has also expanded to South Sudan. When it comes to crypto there are tons of truly cool charities that are transparent (thanks to the use of blockchain), grassroots, and not organized or governed by political interests.

Satoshi Nakamoto’s vision and protocol for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system has revolutionized the way finance can be done. With this revolution have come all kinds of new opportunities for those with great and innovative ideas to enjoy super cool jobs.

Generally, these trends are in-line with shrinking Bitcoin BTC trading volumes, reports research firm Delphi Digital.

Still, the firm highlighted 220,000 BTC (worth roughly $1.6 billion at current prices) bought way back in November 2017 — the start of peak Bitcoin-mania — that hasn’t moved at all since then. Surely, some strong hands.

The green line represents Bitcoin that hasn’t moved in at least 1 year

There’s less new money entering the cryptocurrency space

Trading activity spiked at the end of October, when Bitcoin‘s price last pushed above $9,000, but volumes had reached six-month lows by the end of November.

“Declining volume has been the trend since the high back in June, a symptom of a general decrease in new money entering the space,” said Delphi Digital analysts.

That blue line represents Bitcoin’s rolling 7-day volume.

In fact, Bitcoin’s month-over-month volume has dropped by 9.4 percent across the top cryptocurrency exchanges, with the largest decline coming from spot USD markets.

The firm again noted this means it’s possible there’s less capital entering and exiting the space.

Binance and Huobi attract most of the inflowing Bitcoin

As for where the inflowing Bitcoin goes, major exchanges Binance and Huobi persist as the industry’s dominant trading venues. Together, they account for over 50 percent of BTC deposits every month since August.

There’s more Bitcoin flowing into exchanges than out.

Analysts noted that OKEx and Huobi saw “strong increases” since the beginning of August, but highlighted that a portion of the latter’s activity was actually a byproduct of a cryptocurrency-fueled Ponzi scheme known as PlusToken.

“The worst monthly decline since the same month last year definitely added insult to injury to the crypto market’s ongoing drawdown. Fading catalysts and sentiment are partially to blame, but one of the real culprits is the lack of new buyer demand,” said Delphi Digital.

“Often times, it seems as if capital is just being reshuffled among existing player who can ignite violent market moves given the minuscule size of this market, so a renewed enthusiasm among investors is going to be required for bitcoin (and crypto at large) to reverse its downward trend,” it added.",2019-12-11,https://www.coindesk.com/2019-proved-that-asia-is-ahead-in-crypto-blockchain-adoption,"This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Michael Ou is CEO of CoolBitX, a blockchain security company and creator of the first hardware wallet that enables bluetooth-to-smartphone pairings.

In 2019, it became clear that Asia was moving ahead in cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption and application. Because of internal and external drivers, Asia has been setting the pace in turning ideas in the blockchain space into reality.

Investors in China, Japan, and South Korea are being driven into crypto markets by global and regional trade wars, currency devaluation, and tight government control of individual assets. Global trading platform, eToro, has found consistent spikes in bitcoin activity during key moments of the US-China trade war.

In May, after China announced a tariff hike on $60 billion worth of American goods, and investors immediately moved to divest their wealth elsewhere. The number of new bitcoin positions soared 139% (along with a 108% rise in new gold positions). The increase in both new gold and bitcoin positions has been consistent as the trade war between both powers has continued — with bitcoin witnessing more significant benefits than the precious metal. It seems that amidst increasing uncertainty upon the global economic stage, bitcoin is reaping the benefits.

Additionally, in 2019, Chinese consumers were the greatest users of Tether—using the stablecoin to transfer their yuan across borders, free from government supervision and sanction. While the Chinese government doesn’t allow yuan trading on domestic exchanges, Tether has allowed Chinese consumers to partake in global cryptocurrency markets—with up to 99% of bitcoin spot trades conducted using Tether according to Chainalysis.

Established Markets: Where Fintech Innovation is Commonplace

Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore are established hubs for digital payments adoption and fintech innovation. In the first 9 months of this year alone, investments into Singaporean fintech companies exceeded $1 billion USD, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore stating that this was the result not only of local startup activity but also international fintech companies using Singapore is a base for global expansion.

China is perhaps the first country to be in a position to credibly claim “cashless” status. A 2017 Penguin Intelligence study has shown that 92% of inhabitants in China’s top cities use WeChat Pay or AliPay as their primary payment method. In addition to their prowess within the fintech space, the more traditional markets of Asia’s leading economies have been dubbed as the next bastion of economic growth globally, with the Financial Times predicting that by 2025 we will have entered into a new “Asian Century”. With regional fintech players dominating digital payments, one would question whether crypto can compete and find a foothold to demonstrate its use as a digital payments system.

Global instability has provided opportunities for alternative assets. The Chinese economy and the Yuan are continuing to trend downward amidst a trade war with the US. Hong Kong’s financial sector is suffering the consequences of increased political instability and security risks within the country. Hong Kong’s stock market was the world’s worst performer in Q3. Meanwhile, fraught relations between South Korea and North Korea, as well as Japan, are doing nothing to improve investor confidence in the capital markets, hurting the value of national currencies. With stability increasingly in question, traditional investors and institutions are looking at cryptocurrencies as a means to hedge their assets and diversify their portfolios, creating capital flows into the digital assets space, which has been largely insulated from the knock-on effects of regime instability and international trade conditions.

Emerging Economies: Growth Without Trust

Blockchain and cryptocurrency has a different sort of role in emerging economies, like Philippines and India, where trust in local institutions remains low and new systems and structures created in the crypto markets can bolster feeble financial infrastructures.

Crypto is offering tangible benefits within countries’ struggling to provide adequate services and solutions to consumers.

From the use of cryptocurrencies as a remittance tool—facilitating more convenient, secure, and transparent international payments than legacy payments systems—to interbank transactions, crypto-adoption is offering tangible benefits within countries’ struggling to provide adequate services and solutions to consumers. Far removed from the inefficiencies of local governments and financial apparatus, decentralized finance potentially provides a more stable, secure means of holding and transferring wealth.

2019: Regulating a Grassroots Movement

Singapore, one of the leading hubs for blockchain adoption, now boasts more than 400 fintech firms within the island nation, one for every 14,000 people living in the country. “Blockchain” is the fastest growing job skill in Singapore, and among the top 3 in China, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Vietnam, according to LinkedIn studies. While BTC and ETH continue to enjoy popularity within the region, altcoins like TRON and EOS have special status in Asia. With all of this activity, the region’s regulators have been paying attention. This has resulted in much regulatory proactivity—with countries from Malaysia and Singapore to Japan and South Korea having unveiled comprehensive guidelines for the issuance and purchase of digital assets, while other regions have lagged behind. This may well signal more things to come in the year ahead.

Big companies like Facebook entered the crypto space this year, but there is still a long way for them to go in drawing large consumer-tech firms into the cryptocurrency fold. Mature businesses and institutions are unlikely to enter into the nascent crypto sector if they believe they are rolling the dice on regulatory compliance. Enticing them into the blockchain ecosystem will require clear regulation. Asia is where they may be able to find it.

The region’s regulators have become the forerunners in establishing clear “rules of the game” when it comes to digital assets, engaging closely with groups such as the Financial Action Task Force and key industry players. While the U.S. continues to grapple with the regulation of digital assets, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, and particularly within the island of Jeju, have outlined more comprehensive regulatory boundaries for actors within the blockchain industry. While China has taken a heavy-handed regulatory approach, the government has been nonetheless consistent and clear in the communication of policies surrounding the blockchain sector. This clarity leaves Asia’s regional blockchain sector well-positioned to serve as a vanguard for the development of real-world use cases of cryptocurrency technology and as a leader in consumer engagement.

2020: Cryptocurrencies Coming of Age?

In 2019, Asia became a testing bed for cryptocurrency adoption, presenting real use cases of cryptocurrencies in both highly developed and emerging markets. Pervasive economic tensions, structural instability, and downward market pressures may prove the headwinds necessary for cryptocurrency to finally enter the mainstream.",2019-12-11 12:30:00+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/arrested-alleged-722-million-cryptocurrency-ponzi-scheme-targeting/story?id=67655393,"Three people were arrested -- and two more remain at large -- for involvement in an alleged ""high-tech Ponzi scheme"" that defrauded $722 million out of investors using the ""complex world of cryptocurrency,"" according to federal authorities.

The alleged scheme includes a trail of evidence indicating they were targeting ""dumb"" investors and ""building this whole model on the backs of idiots,"" investigators added.

""The indictment describes the defendants’ use of the complex world of cryptocurrency to take advantage of unsuspecting investors,"" U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a Department of Justice statement on Tuesday announcing the arrests.

""What they allegedly did amounts to little more than a modern, high-tech Ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Carpentino added. ""Working with our law enforcement partners here and across the country, we will ensure that these scammers are held to account for their crimes.""

Matthew Brent Goettsche, 37, and Jobadiah Sinclair Week, 38, of Colorado, were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities. Joseph Franks Abel, 49, of California, also arrested as part of the alleged scheme, was charged with conspiracy to offer and sell unregistered securities.

Two other defendants remain at large, authorities said. Their identities are under seal and were not released.

The men allegedly lived ""lavishly"" while running the scheme, which began more than five years ago.

The three men arrested ""are accused of deploying elaborate tactics to lure thousands of victims with promises of large returns on their investments in a bitcoin mining pool, an advanced method of profiting on cryptocurrency,"" Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office, said in a statement.

""The defendants allegedly made hundreds of millions of dollars by continuing to recruit new investors over several years while spending victims' money lavishly,"" Delacourt added.

John R. Tafur, the special agent in charge at the IRS Criminal Investigation's Newark Field Office described their alleged scheme as a ""classic con game with a virtual twist.""

From April 2014 until this month, the men allegedly ran BitClub Network, which rewarded investors for recruiting new investors and brought in money from them in exchange for shares in the apparent crypto mining pools.

Goettsche told the others to target ""dumb"" investors, who he referred to as ""sheep,"" authorities said. At one point, he said he was ""building this whole model on the backs of idiots,"" according the DOJ.

In a particularly damning exchange in February 2015, Goettsche told a colleague to ""bump up the daily mining earnings starting today by 60%."" His colleague said back: ""that is not sustainable, that is ponzi teritori [sic] and fast cash-out ponzi ... but sure,"" authorities said.

Abel and Weeks promoted BitClub Network to investors around the country, law enforcement said. In one promotional video, Abel told investors that BitClub Network was ""too big to fail.""

In September 2017, Goettsche directed a colleague at BitClub Network to ""[d]rop mining earnings significantly starting now,"" so that he could ""retire RAF!!! (rich as f***).""

The men were arrested across the country: Goettsche in Colorado, Weeks in Florida and Abel in California. Their initial court appearances are scheduled in the districts of their arrests, according to authorities.

It is not immediately clear if the three arrested have obtained attorneys. Attempts by ABC News to reach them on Wednesday were unsuccessful.

The DOJ is encouraging victims of the BitClub Network scheme to come forward at a designated website.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/11/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-mining-hash-rate-china-renewable-energy-blockchain/,"Bitcoin BTC miners in China wield two-thirds of the network’s processing power (hash rate), and more than half of it is controlled by a single province.

That figure, which increased from 60 percent in June, marks the highest recorded by digital asset firm CoinShares since it started tracking Bitcoin‘s hash rate almost two years ago.

According to CoinShare’s data shared with Hard Fork, Bitcoin miners in Sichuan, China are responsible for 54 percent of its global hash rate.

“Out of the remaining 35 percent of [global] miners, we estimate that 31 percent of global [hash rate] production is evenly split between Washington, New York, British Columbia, Alberta, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Siberian Federal District of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Iran,” said CoinShares.

Overwhelming majority of Bitcoin energy is renewable

As for where Bitcoin‘s miners get their electricity for generating their crypto-revenue — which CoinShares notes is on track to reach $5.4 billion this year — it’s reportedly mostly from renewable energy.

Indeed, the firm estimates that 73 percent of the electricity used by the world’s Bitcoin miners is renewable. If true, this is likely to ruffle feathers of critics who continually espouse that Bitcoin is bad for the environment.

“Overall, our findings reaffirm our view that Bitcoin mining is acting as a global electricity buyer of last resort and therefore tends to cluster around comparatively under-utilised renewables infrastructure,” said CoinShares.

“This could help turn loss making renewables projects profitable and in time — as the industry matures and settles as permanent in the public eye — could act as a driver of new renewables developments in locations that were previously uneconomical,” it concluded.

Over the past year, Bitcoin‘s hash rate has climbed dramatically, regularly breaking all-time-high records. CoinShares noted this is likely due to more powerful mining chips released by Chinese firms such as Bitmain.

The firm expects Bitcoin‘s hash rate to be distributed more evenly across the world as those mining chips become more readily exported.",2019-12-11,https://news.bitcoin.com/denmarks-tax-authority-sends-warning-letters-to-20000-crypto-owners/,"Denmark's Tax Authority Sends Warning Letters to 20,000 Crypto Owners

The tax authority of Denmark has reportedly sent out warning letters to 20,000 crypto owners asking them to amend their tax returns, pay taxes on crypto gains, or face penalties. The tax agency is demanding a full breakdown of their crypto transactions; it recently obtained information on these traders from three local crypto exchanges.

Warning Letters to Crypto Investors

Danish Skattestyrelsen, the tax authority of Denmark, has reportedly sent out warning letters to 20,000 cryptocurrency owners. Swedish crypto tax startup Koinly posted a copy of the letter on its website on Monday. The company detailed:

In the last 2 weeks, the agency began sending out warning letters to these investors urging them to amend their tax reports by the 15th of December or face penalties.

“Many of our Danish users have received these letters, Skat is asking for a full breakdown of all their transactions and asking them to fix all past reports as well,” said CEO Robin Singh who founded Koinly last year. “Filing tax on cryptocurrency trades is a difficult task as crypto traders usually hold several exchange accounts and wallets and freely transfer crypto between them, so there’s no easy way to figure out what the capital gains are for any particular trade.” The company claims to have helped thousands of crypto investors track and generate tax reports for funds worth over $250 million last year.

Tax Agency Has Info on 20,000 Crypto Traders

Earlier this year, Skattestyrelsen announced that it had been authorized by the country’s tax council, Skatterådet, to obtain information on crypto traders using local exchanges. The agency then announced on Aug. 29 that it had acquired information on 20,000 citizens trading cryptocurrency on these platforms. The tax agency declared:

For the first time, the tax authorities have received information on trading, for example, bitcoins, on Danish crypto exchanges. In total, information of approx. 20,000 citizens.

The exchanges were required to provide information on all crypto purchases and sales made between Jan. 1, 2016, and Dec. 31, 2018. The data obtained includes “identification information such as names, addresses, social security numbers and possibly CVR [business registration] information,” Skattestyrelsen revealed.

How Crypto Transactions Are Taxed in Denmark

The Danish tax authority explains on its website that trading bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies is considered speculation, meaning that the purpose of acquiring them is to make a profit. Therefore, as a general rule, profits or losses from their sales must be disclosed to the tax authority. Anyone unclear whether their trading activities are considered speculation can ask the tax agency for a specific “binding” answer, which costs DKK 400 ($60) and takes between 3-6 months. The answer is valid for a maximum of five years.

The letters sent to some 20,000 crypto traders request information about profits and losses from crypto transactions made during the fiscal year 2016 through 2018, calculated using the FIFO method. The tax agency’s website describes:

If you have several purchases, you must initially calculate profits and losses according to the FIFO principle (FIFO = First In First Out). This means that the bitcoins you bought first are the ones you sell first.

Tax Agencies Worldwide Turning Attention to Cryptocurrencies

A growing number of tax authorities worldwide are turning their attention to cryptocurrencies as they have become more popular with growing market capitalizations. Koinly asserted Monday that “Tax agencies are taking note of bitcoin and want to avoid it being seen as a safe haven from taxes.” CEO Singh noted that Denmark has special laws about how capital gains are reported, elaborating:

You can only offset profits with losses from the same cryptocurrency during the same income tax year. This is different from how it works in other countries so existing solutions require a lot of manual work.

The Danish tax authority is not the only one that has sent letters to crypto investors. The U.S., Canada, and India are among the countries that have similarly sent letters to crypto owners seeking to tax their crypto gains.

In July, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that it sent out letters to over 10,000 crypto investors reminding them of their tax obligations. The IRS has also stepped up other efforts to identify and convict crypto tax evaders. In its report issued last week, the agency emphasized that “Cryptocurrencies are undermining the financial and tax system,” adding that cyber criminals “now deal in cryptocurrency, again thinking this will make them anonymous, but our agents have once again proved that there is nowhere to hide. We will not stop in our pursuit.” Furthermore, the IRS is now using a new tax form requiring all tax filers to disclose whether they received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired any crypto during the year.

“As regulations and guidelines around cryptocurrency taxes clear up, more people are likely to receive similar letters,” Koinly wrote. “This is just the first step in the fight against tax evasion and more serious actions are likely to be taken against investors in the future so it is a good idea to get your affairs in order as early as possible.” News.Bitcoin.com has previously published a tax guide as well as a list of useful tax tools for crypto owners.

Mark Cuban says there's ""no chance"" that bitcoin can become a reliable currency.

""Not because it can't work technically,"" the Shark Tank star and owner of the Dallas Mavericks said in an email to Forbes. ""But rather because it's too difficult to use, too easy to hack, way too easy to lose, too hard to understand, too hard to assess a value.""

Given the raft of rival cryptocurrencies available, Cuban said, it's also ""too much work for people to know why BTC over everything else.""

The billionaire has experience in commercializing new technologies. He made his fortune by building Broadcast.com — a pioneer in video-streaming technology — then selling it to Yahoo! in a $5.7 billion stock deal in 1999.

Cuban compared bitcoin to baseball cards, comic books, and artwork in a Wired video in September, arguing the cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value and is ""only worth what somebody will pay for it."" He added that he'd ""rather have bananas, I can eat bananas.""

The price of bitcoin has plunged from about $12,000 in August to below $7,250 at the time of writing.

On December 10, Switzerland-based firm Amun AG announced the company’s base prospectus has been approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA). The ETP provider said it has extensive plans to expand its digital asset ETPs throughout Europe, while Sweden shows “strong demand” for these products.

Also read: Wisdomtree’s Physically Backed Bitcoin ETP Goes Live on SIX Stock Exchange

The digital currency-based ETP provider Amun AG gained headway in Sweden this week when the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA) approved its base prospectus. A base prospectus essentially describes an offering so a firm can file for registration similarly to traditional security-based ETPs currently traded on the regulated market. Amun said in a press statement after the SFSA approval, the company is pleased to confirm its plans for expanding its digital currency-based ETPs. Amun already provides exchange-traded products (ETP) that track digital currencies and a variety of Amun’s crypto ETPs are traded on Swiss Bourse.

“Our mission is clear and that is to help investors more safely, cost-effectively and easily invest in crypto asset classes through our crypto ETPs. We are very fortunate to have finished this process within four months of its consultancy period” Amun’s President Ms. Ophelia Snyder remarked during the announcement. Snyder added:

We recognise that the regulatory framework in Sweden has been supportive of such initiatives and we welcome its deliberation.

Right now Amun manages a slew of crypto ETPs that are traded on Switzerland’s principal stock exchange SIX. Amun recently partnered with Bitcoin Suisse in October to offer the Amun Bitcoin Suisse ETP (ticker: ABBA) a fund that tracks prices for both ETH and BTC. Then Amun also offers the ‘HODL’ ETP which consists of a basket of five different digital currencies.

It also offers an ETP for the Bitwise Select 10, Amun’s Sygnum Platform Winners Index, and six single tracker ETPs that use ETH, BNB, XRP, BCH, XTZ, and BTC. However, Amun’s SFSA approval announcement does not disclose what ETPs the firm will list or which exchanges it will use in Europe. Amun is working with regulators across the EU and the firm says there’s a lot of demand in Sweden for crypto-based investment vehicles.

“The combination of strong demand for ETPs in Sweden – especially in crypto assets – among private investors and institutional clients and our strong expertise in these product categories create ideal conditions for Amun’s entry into the Swedish and European Union markets for ETPs,” Snyder further stated.

Amun’s Swedish EU approved prospectus will help the firm gain a foothold in Europe. The SFSA’s approval shows that investment funds tethered to digital assets continue to enter the world of mainstream finance. During the first week of December, Amun’s cash-settled ETP’s got some competition on the Swiss exchange SIX when the New York-based Wisdom Tree listed its physically-settled bitcoin ETP.

The Evolving Bitcoin Landscape in Argentina

The temperature has steadily been rising in the Argentinian crypto space for several months of 2019, creating a clear timeline for the increased acceptance of bitcoin and other alternative assets. The nation’s economy and fiat currency have been especially wobbly since August 2019 as the stock market hemorrhaged during an upset presidential election. In addition to damaging the return value on investments, this also caused the peso’s value to plummet. Very soon after this initial trigger, the relative valuation and trading volume of bitcoin spiked to levels comparable to conflict-stricken regions like Hong Kong.

The Central Bank of Argentina, run by the national government, attempted to stabilize the situation first by imposing limitations on the purchase of USD. Beginning by limiting Argentinians to only $10,000 in purchases per month in September 2019, the bank added additional restrictions on October 31, 2019. In addition to limiting the amount of USD that a citizen can acquire per month to $200, the bank also announced that bitcoin could only be purchased by means of “funds transferred from a bank account.”

Since this time, the relative valuation and trade volume of bitcoin have spiked yet again in Argentina, even compared to the initial increase when the peso first hit shaky territory. The bitcoin price was reported to reach as high as $12,759 on an Argentinian exchange in November 2019, marking a 38 percent premium compared to other exchanges around the world. In that same month, Argentina exchanged an estimated 19.4 million pesos on LocalBitcoins.

To make better sense of the dynamics of these changes, Bitcoin Magazine reached out to several Argentinian bitcoiners to learn more about their firsthand experiences.

Santiago Siri is the founder of the Democracy Earth Foundation and has been involved in both crypto-related political activism and the largest bitcoin exchange in Latin America, Bitex, for several years. Having moved to New York from Argentina, Siri has maintained a base of connections across the international crypto space and particularly in his country of origin.

Lautaro Dragan, on the other hand, is the lead developer for decentralized media protocol Po.et and has in-depth experience with both the Argentinian banking system and the situation on the ground as he lives in Buenos Aires.

Searching for Alternatives

Siri claimed that there is a direct correspondence between the suppression of the dollar and the rise of bitcoin in Argentina.

“Since the peso is a currency that lacks trust from the people due to its high inflation rate (about 50 precent), most people save money in dollars,” Siri said. “But keeping dollars in the bank can be risky since this is not the first time this happens. Back in 2001, the country lived one of its most traumatic days when a similar limit was imposed. The growth of adoption in Bitcoin is a no brainer to most: censorship resistant money that cannot be taken by the government matters to the average Argentine that does not want to see their money being taken away by the government.”

This dynamic is of particular importance to regions of global instability, he added.

“When people start stashing cash, that also increases the risk of violent assaults and overall insecurity of the country,” Siri explained. “Back in 2001, a rise in ‘express kidnapping’ emerged from criminals chasing people taking their money out of the bank ... so the ability to keep the money in an immutable ledger and protected by a code no one can break is also very beneficial there.”

Dragan concurred with this analysis but also added some sobering commentary.

“It’s a bittersweet feeling,” he claimed, “because even though we’re happy we have Bitcoin to help us in this situation, nobody is happy about the restrictions, since they affect everyone for the worse and are a symptom of deeply-rooted economic issues.”

Dragan said that hyperinflation in the Argentine peso has been a regular feature of the country for his entire life, since “reading my high school history book and seeing in it a black-and-white picture of a panettone selling for 1 million pesos, and [growing] up on stories of people losing most of their savings due to them being force-converted to ARS and inflation immediately striking afterwards, or hyper-inflation rendering your entire salary worthless.”



He explained that many Argentinians turn to alternative currencies as a chance to access the most basic features of financial security.

“The sad truth is that, as things are, most people can’t save a single cent,” Dragan said. “The ones who can save buy USD to prevent their savings from being eaten by hyperinflation, and the lucky ones who work digitally look for remote work paid in USD, GBP or EUR to prevent their salaries from being eaten by hyperinflation.”

After many personal difficulties with regularly using foreign fiat currencies or opening up a U.S. bank account, Dragan said that he began to turn increasingly to cryptocurrency.

“Even though bitcoin is too volatile to be a good store of value right now, it’s possibly the best means of transferring value humanity has ever seen,” he said. “And that alone is such a powerful tool that makes a case for crypto on its own, but it will probably also ensure it will live long enough for it to become a good store of value too.”

Argentina’s Bitcoin Community

Siri described the Argentinian cryptocurrency space as “a very active community that has grown big very fast,” while noting that there is room for Bitcoin to grow.

“Probably we are still a long way from making Bitcoin a mainstream thing, but you'll probably find among the hacker culture of Buenos Aires some of the best cryptocurrency engineers in the world,” Siri said. “It's worth noticing the emergence of startups like Zeppelin (leading smart contract auditors in the world) or RSK (smart contracts with a BTC sidechain) that emerge from that hacker culture. I'm currently helping to bring Devcon 6, the annual event held by the Ethereum Foundation, to Buenos Aires in 2020.”

Dragan concurred with this assessment.

“In Argentina, we have had a few small businesses accept bitcoin for several years, but we’re now seeing larger businesses joining too,” he said. “Last year, Garbarino Viajes, one of Argentina’s biggest travel agencies, took the lead on this, accepting bitcoin as a means of payments. This year, Mercado Libre, an Argentine company that operates in all of Latin America, started accepting bitcoin in Brazil. More large business are sure to follow.”

Dragan added that more institutional adoption could be forthcoming.

“I’m confident we will see more of this in the 2020s, and traditional banks will start feeling the pressure and want in,” he said.

To this end, Bitex, the Latin American cryptocurrency exchange that Siri is a partner in, has facilitated smoother entry of private banks into the wider crypto-economic system.

“The regulation announced by the Central Bank specifically forbid buying cryptocurrency with credit cards but said nothing about direct bank transfers,” Siri said. “Bitex has been one of the pioneering bitcoin exchanges in the local market there and has been able to establish solid relations with banks in the country. Still, a lot of bank managers, due to age or lack of information are a bit skeptical about accepting services willing to operate using BTC ... But, thankfully, this is beginning to change thanks to the reputation built by companies like Bitex.”

Dragan also noted some mixed institutional progress in Bitcoin adoption, noting the potential for regulatory clarity from the Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos (AFIP), Argentina’s revenue service, though with some skepticism about how much of a help this will ultimately be for local Bitcoiners.

“I know the AFIP, our tax authority, is working on ways to properly support cryptocurrencies, and the new policies and laws make it clear that the government is aware they need to do something about it, but they still don’t understand it well and isn’t a high priority given all the issues our country is facing, so adoption grows slowly but steadily,” he said.

Of course, the cryptocurrency space in Argentina is not only turning to bitcoin, largely due to the perception Dragan highlighted that the asset is better at transferring value than storing it long-term. The Ethereum-based stablecoin DAI, Dragan claimed, “has been growing like crazy” in Argentina. Siri agreed with this, telling us, “Most people cannot afford big swings on their savings. That's why adoption of DAI is growing in Argentina: you want a currency that cannot be taken away by a bank, that is pegged to the dollar and that is stable in order to be able to use it for saving.”

“Bitcoin as a Financial Battleground”

Siri also commented on how crackdowns on Bitcoin can play out on a global economic stage.

“It's interesting to see how Bitcoin is being weaponized by Nation-State actors,” he said. “Because Bitcoin can be used either for good or for bad, we can find some extreme cases on how various sanctioned nations like Venezuela and North Korea have tried to use cryptocurrency both within their own borders and when dealing with other nations.”

“I'm not stating all this to say bad things about Bitcoin: I'm a long-time HODLer myself,” Siri continued. “But it is important to understand how Bitcoin is becoming the battleground of a financial battle that is being pushed by the USA and its economic sanctions mechanism.”

Even with the price already rising in Argentina due to these internal pressures, we can already see how this “bitcoin as a financial battleground” thesis has played out more recently. On December 2, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new set of tariffs on metal products, especially steel and aluminum, from Argentina. On December 9, 2019, the Argentinian president appointed a new economy minister to his cabinet, who has repeatedly voiced skepticism of institutions like the International Monetary Fund with close ties to U.S. international economic designs. Whether motivated directly by these developments or not, fears of further peso inflation and economic downturn have likely caused bitcoin’s value in Argentina to spike yet again: LocalBitcoins trading volume in Argentina reached a new all-time high of 22 million ARS in the first week of December 2019.

As a parting sentiment, Siri wanted audiences abroad to appreciate Argentina’s unique and valuable relationship with financial assets across the board.

“Argentina will break every single financial system you can think of,” he claimed. “Whether it's the Argentine peso, the US dollar, Bitcoin, Ethereum or anything that ends up coming next ... we Argentines are going to make sure we figure out how to hack it.”

While it’s noteworthy that, for the average citizen, a stablecoin like DAI might be a more reliable way to protect paychecks and savings than either the fiat currency or bitcoin, the past few months of increasing bitcoin trading volume and adoption among economic uncertainty in Argentina illustrate a real-life use case for the technology.

“If Bitcoin is to supplant the USD, I’m sure it won’t happen for decades,” Dragan concluded. “But the key takeaway here is that we don’t need it to. Bitcoin is an excellent means of transferring value as it is. Even in the hypothetical case that we discovered it is impossible for it to scale, it already is good enough.”

Dubbed Elliptic Discovery, the product collects detailed profiles of more than 200 global crypto exchanges to enable banks to manage risks associated with crypto transactions, Business Insider reports Dec. 11.

Elliptic Discovery includes data collected since 2013

Designed specifically for banks, Elliptic Discovery reportedly provides compliance teams with necessary insights to identify flows of funds on crypto assets and assess risks including money laundering. The tool is reportedly based on Elliptic's data that was collected since 2013 and offers a wide range of identifiers and risk indicators in terms of exposure to crypto-assets through exchanges, the report notes.

James Smith, CEO and co-founder at Elliptic, noted that the new tool is created to address the existing lack of visibility into the crypto-asset ecosystem by banking institutions.

Banks' lack of visibility to crypto ecosystem has caused “zero-tolerance”

According to Smith, this lack of access to the crypto industry has resulted in “zero-tolerance” to the new asset class and frustrated customers, while banks “have remained blind to the actual risks posed by their exposure to crypto-assets.”

Smith pointed out that there are different types of crypto currency exchanges, which would be taken into account by the banks while assessing the risks. He said:

“Elliptic Discovery changes that by enabling banks to shine a light on their customers' crypto-asset activity and take a risk-based approach [...] Not all crypto-asset exchanges are alike and Elliptic Discovery will allow banks to make this distinction and seize the opportunity to work more closely with these businesses, based on an evidence-based assessment of the risk.”

Elliptic Discovery to help China and India alleviate regulatory scepticism towards crypto

Elliptic has not specified which banks have already signed up for Discovery or expressed interest in doing so in the report.

Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at Elliptic, said in an email to Cointelegraph that the company has seen significant interest from banks around the world. Robinson expressed hope that Elliptic Discovery could help alleviate regulatory pressure to crypto in some jurisdictions. He said:

“In countries such as China and India, where the regulatory environment severely restricts the activity of crypto exchanges, we hope that the availability of tools such as Elliptic Discovery will prompt regulators to reevaluate these restrictive policies.

Elliptic is a partner of major crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance

Backed by Japanese banking giant SBI Group and Santander's venture capital arm Santander InnoVentures, Elliptic is a major global crypto forensics and analysis firm. The company is known for providing its services to American crypto exchange Coinbase and has been a partner of Binance, one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, since May 2019. In November 2019, Elliptic issued a report tying about $400 million worth XRP tokens to illegal transactions.

Earlier this year, Elliptic refuted allegations that it was collecting and selling clients’ user data to third parties for financial gain.",

The New York State Department of Financial Services, the Bitlicense regulator, has published a proposed framework for licensed companies seeking to list new coins. This is the first time the regulator has proposed changes to its crypto regulation in five years. Among the changes, licensees will be able to self-certify the compliance of their new coins without having to obtain prior approval from the regulator.

First Regulatory Changes in 5 Years

The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) published “proposed guidance regarding the adoption or listing of virtual currencies” on Wednesday. “To provide regulatory clarity and efficiency, and to ensure that our approach to regulating virtual currency businesses reflects the realities of an evolving market,” the DFS announced:

We are reviewing our virtual currency regulations and the manner in which they are implemented.

The department started regulating the crypto industry in July 2014. So far, two dozen Bitlicenses or trust charters have been granted to crypto companies to operate in the state of New York. The regulator explained that some of its licensees have asked to list new coins in addition to those listed in their initial applications with the DFS. The department is now seeking comments from all interested parties and the general public regarding two proposed coin adoption or listing options it wants to make available to licensees. Comments should be submitted by Jan. 27, 2020.

The Proposed Framework

Firstly, the DFS proposes creating a webpage listing all of the coins it has pre-approved for all licensees to list without having to obtain prior approval. The list “may be updated from time to time, as long as such listed coins have not been subject to any modification, division, or change after their listing on the DFS web-page,” the regulator detailed, adding:

Coins currently contemplated for the list include bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, ether classic, litecoin, ripple, paxos standard, and Gemini dollar.

Secondly, the regulator is proposing a framework that allows the listing policy to be tailored to a licensee’s specific business model and risk profile to create a firm-specific listing policy. The DFS clarified:

Upon approval, the company may self-certify the listing of new coins on an ongoing basis, consistent with the company’s approved policy, with prior notice to the department and without the need for prior approval.

The DFS reiterated that licensees that do not have DFS-approved company coin-listing policies are required to seek its prior approval in order to offer coins that are not on its approved list. Furthermore, all licensees “are required to keep DFS informed, no later than at the time of their next quarterly filing, of all coins to be used or offered in connection with their Virtual Currency Business Activities.”

A licensee’s coin-listing policy “should consist of robust procedures that comprehensively address all steps involved in the review and approval of virtual currencies in connection with the Virtual Currency Business Activities of the licensee,” the DFS described. The policy must be tailored to the licensee’s “specific business model, operations, customers and counterparties, geographies of operations, service providers, and the use, purpose and specific features of the coins being considered. It should also include procedures for notifying DFS of new coin listings.”

Currently, five cryptocurrencies are supported. This follows a successful implementation and positive results of a pilot program at a few branches. The Post found interest in this service and plans to offer additional crypto services in the future.

55 Croatian Post Branches Can Exchange Crypto

Croatian Post announced on Wednesday that its customers can now exchange five cryptocurrencies for Croatian kuna at 55 post offices throughout the country. Croatian Post is the biggest provider of postal services in Croatia. In addition to offering postal, financial, retail, and insurance services, the Post declared:

Starting December 11, all Croatian and foreign service users will be able to convert their cryptocurrencies to HRK in just a few simple steps.

The announcement explains that once a customer submits a crypto exchange request, “a QR code will be scanned and you will receive cash at a post office.” Currently, five cryptocurrencies are supported: bitcoin core, ether, stellar, XRP, and EOS.

Croatian Post’s website lists all of the 55 post offices with the crypto exchange service and provides a calculator for customers to find out how much HRK they will receive from the Post for exchanging their cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency exchange is carried out in cooperation with Electrocoin, a Croatian crypto brokerage and payment processing provider.

Noting that “Digitization is one of our development strategies and a driver of numerous business projects,” the Post further announced:

In the future, we also plan to introduce the option to buy cryptocurrencies at Croatian Post’s post offices, thus making them the central points for cryptocurrency transactions across Croatia.

Successful Pilot Project and Other Countries

Croatian Post currently has 1,016 post offices, 2,135 counters, and more than 10,000 employees, according to its website. The crypto exchange service launch at 55 post offices follows “a successful implementation and positive results of the pilot project for cryptocurrency exchange in post offices in Zadar,” the Post detailed, adding:

The pilot project has shown that there is an interest for this type of service, which is why Croatian Post will introduce the service of cryptocurrency exchange at post offices across the country.

The same five cryptocurrencies were offered in the pilot project, which was implemented in three post offices in Zadar, a city on Croatia’s Dalmatian coast. “In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of cryptocurrency users, who very often plan to travel to those places where they can convert their digital money to the national currency,” the Post elaborated on Wednesday. “Due to a wide range of possibilities this service offers, the numerous guests visiting Croatia will find our cities even more interesting.”

Post offices in a few other countries have been offering similar services such as in Liechtenstein and Austria. In February, Liechtensteinische Post started selling BTC. Since then, ETH, LTC, and XRP have been added and the service is currently available at post offices in Vaduz and Schaan. In Austria, over 400 Austria post office branches and about 1,350 post partner stores throughout the country sell Bitpanda crypto vouchers which can be redeemed online, Bitpanda’s website details. Croatians can also trade BCH on Bitcoin.com’s non-custodian, peer-to-peer marketplace.

The announcement comes amid reports linking Bitfinex to drug trafficking and money-laundering schemes operated by the owners of Crypto Capital.

Over the past year, Chainalysis deployed its real-time anti-money laundering and compliance software, and also expanded its coverage beyond Bitcoin to include Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and stablecoins.

“The solution does not share information identifying users, which is kept strictly in-house. We are excited to work alongside the Chainalysis team to continue to build out a safe and robust platform for our users,” said Peter Warrack, Chief Compliance Officer at Bitfinex.

Chainalysis’ compliance software can help both crypto firms and law enforcement agencies detect suspicious activity in order to battle any related criminal activity. It uses pattern recognition, algorithms, and millions of open source references to “identify and categorize thousands of cryptocurrency services to raise live alerts on transactions involved in suspicious activity,” the company says.

The company has already signed other major cryptocurrency exchanges, including the likes of Binance, to automate their process of screening transactions and monitoring user activity.

Chainalysis has a few rivals in the market whose solutions strive to prevent, detect, and investigate cryptocurrency money laundering, fraud, and compliance violations. The biggest competitor, though, is the UK-based Elliptic, which offers proprietary compliance and fraud detection technology.

Chinese Bitcoin miners now control a record proportion of the network’s hashrate, according to new research. An estimated 65% of BTC mining now happens in China.

CoinShares, a digital asset investment fund, noted this high since the firm started monitoring the network in late 2017.

Research jointly published in October 2018 out of Princeton and Florida International University estimated that 74% of Bitcoin hashpower is managed by Chinese mining pools⁠, a service that allows miners to pool their resources to reduce the randomness in Bitcoin block reward payouts. However, these figures are a poor gauge of mining centralization because miners from any geographic location can participate in these pools.

Mining is centralized in China because most Bitcoin hardware is manufactured in the country ⁠— with juggernauts like Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT dominating the landscape. Chinese customers tend to get preferential pricing and avoid the friction of tariffs and shipping, according to sources familiar with the industry.

Meanwhile, cheap hydro-power makes Sichuan one of the best places in the world to deploy mining hardware. An estimated 54% of the global mining share happens out of this region of China alone.

“The centralization of hashrate threatens the ultimate promise of cryptocurrency networks: that no one party or group controls the ledger or flow of transactions,” said mining expert Kristy-Leigh Minehan to Crypto Briefing. “Any number of natural disasters or state-level threats could introduce network turmoil, whether through increased block times, transaction costs, or transaction censorship at the state-level.”

These figures run contrary to the narrative that the U.S. is on the rise as a mining hub that could challenge China. In October, Bitmain launched a 50 megawatt facility in Texas. Just last month, Northern Bitcoin AG and Whinstone U.S. Inc. merged to open a 100-acre Bitcoin facility in the same state.

Yet, the trade war between the United States and China jeopardizes the American mining industry. Growing tariffs on hardware will further harm margins.

Whether mining centralization will actually impact the trajectory of Bitcoin, however, is still hotly debated.",2019-12-12 22:46:31+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/regulated-swiss-crypto-bank-seba-expands-services-to-9-new-countries,"Switzerland-based cryptocurrency bank SEBA has expanded its services to nine new countries. According to Finance Magnates on Dec. 12, SEBA revealed that accounts are now fully operational for institutional clients and accredited investors in Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Portugal.

As previously reported, SEBA Bank AG (formerly SEBA Crypto AG) is a fully-regulated institution, having secured a banking and securities dealer license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in August 2019.

Extensive crypto banking services

As part of its account services, SEBA offers a SEBAwallet app, e-banking services and SEBA card facilities, with support for five major cryptocurrencies: (BTC), Ether (ETH), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC) and Ether Classic (ETC).

The bank provides investors with both crypto-crypto and crypto-fiat conversion services and offers enterprise accounts for blockchain firms and their employees.

These days bitcoin and a variety of other digital assets are now being traded as funds and traditional equity holdings. The landscape of crypto investment vehicles has changed significantly as institutional and retail investors don’t need direct exposure to cryptocurrencies in order to invest in this technology.

Traditional Investment Products Tethered to Digital Assets

Bitcoin has been around for more than a decade and the digital asset has invoked the creation of trusts, exchange-traded products, cash-settled futures, and investment funds. Investment products like these are tied to cryptocurrencies like BTC but there’s a slew of others that track baskets of coins and single assets like ETH, BCH, and XRP. Derivatives products allow investors to trade crypto-based futures and options adding a whole new landscape to digital currency markets. For products like these, customers don’t need to hold the cryptocurrency or be concerned about storage as the exposure is quite different than traditional crypto spot markets.

Crypto Products Managed by Grayscale, CME Group, Erisx, Amun AG, Ledgerx, and Wisdomtree

One of the earliest investment vehicles tethered to BTC is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) which launched on September 25, 2013. Originally GBTC was an investment for accredited investors only but the product eventually received FINRA approval so eligible shares could trade publicly. The Trust is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF) per se, but the product is modeled in a similar fashion. GBTC can be traded on the over-the-counter market OTCQX and since the trust’s launch, Grayscale has created a variety of other investment solutions for other cryptocurrencies. Currently, there’s the Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust, Litecoin Trust, Stellar Lumens Trust, Horizen Trust, Zcash Trust, XRP Trust, and the Digital Large Cap Fund.

Investors can also purchase bitcoin exchange futures offered by the global markets company CME Group. The company announced it was offering BTC-based futures on October 31, 2017, and investors have been able to trade the derivatives product since December 2017. Essentially CME Group’s BTC futures are cash-settled, based on the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR). The BRR allows the exchange to reference the daily rate of BTC prices measured in USD. Each contract unit is equal to five bitcoins and with a margin rate of 35%, investors can trade the BTC product on CME Globex and CME Clearport.

Investors interested in crypto futures products can also trade with Bakkt, but the offerings are physically settled futures. Additionally in July, Erisx was approved by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and granted a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) license. Ledgerx was also CFTC approved a week prior by receiving a designated contract market (DCM) license so the firm can provide new derivatives products. More futures contracts that utilize bitcoin cash (BCH) will soon be available at a CFTC-regulated exchange during the first quarter of 2020.

News.Bitcoin.com just reported on Amun AG getting its base prospectus approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA). Right now Amun manages nine exchange-traded products (ETPs) that are traded on Swiss Bourse. The company offers the Amun Bitcoin Suisse ETP (ticker: ABBA) a fund that tracks prices for both ETH and BTC.

Alongside this, Amun’s other index ETPs consist of the ‘Hodl’ crypto basket, the Bitwise Select 10, and the Sygnum Platform Winners ETP. Amun also offers six single digital currency tracking ETPs for BCH, BNB, BTC, XRP, ETH, and XTZ. Investors can obtain Amun products on the Swiss exchange SIX and after the SFSA approval Amun plans to expand into more European markets. Another ETP listed on Swiss Bourse is Wisdomtree’s physically-settled ETP which was recently listed on the stock exchange. The New York-based Wisdomtree ETP called BTCW allows people to invest in BTC “without needing to set up with a custodian themselves.”

ETPs and Traditional Finance Applications Changed the Precious Metals Landscape, Will It Do the Same to Cryptocurrencies?

On December 7, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the Stone Ridge Trust VI registration and the firm is cleared to launch the NYDIG Bitcoin Strategy Fund. The fund invests in BTC futures contracts that are cash-settled on CFTC registered exchanges. A similar fund from France launched on December 6 when the French asset management firm Napoleon AM launched the “Napoleon Bitcoin Fund.” The fund is only available to residents of France and it requires a $110,000 buy-in. Just like the Stone Ridge Bitcoin Strategy Fund the Napoleon Bitcoin Fund will use CME Group-based cash-settled BTC futures.

Just like precious metals markets in the eighties, digital currencies are finding a home within traditional finance. Exchange-traded products, trusts and other types of investment funds transformed gold and precious metals markets 16 years ago. During the late nineties, precious metal-based funds started to grow exponentially, but the first gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) didn’t launch until March 28, 2003. The same thing is happening with bitcoin and other digital currencies within the cryptoconomy. Even though there’s a wide range of traditional investment vehicles tied to crypto many speculators are patiently waiting for a U.S. approved Bitcoin ETF. So far, after many attempts from myriad firms the U.S. regulator (SEC) still hasn’t approved a Bitcoin ETF. Despite the lack of a regulated ETF in the U.S., firms like Amun, Bakkt, Grayscale, CME Group, Wisdomtree, and others still provide traditional investment vehicles tied to crypto.

As an important partner of crypto companies in Germany and Europe, Solarisbank aims to be among the first financial institutions in the Federal Republic to start keeping cryptocurrencies. The tech company maintains a digital banking platform to which other businesses can connect and use its API to build and offer their own financial products and services. It obtained a German banking license in 2016 which allows it to operate also in other jurisdictions in the European Economic Area (EEA).

Solarisbank has been involved with important projects in the European crypto space such as the development of the crypto trading app Bison and the launch of the digital asset trading platform BSDEX by the Boerse Stuttgart stock exchange. Its partnership with cryptocurrency banking provider Bitwala allows customers in 31 EEA countries to have a German bank account with an integrated bitcoin wallet. The new subsidiary which was presented Wednesday will allow it to take full advantage of the new German anti-money laundering law permitting banks to hold cryptocurrencies.

Solaris Digital Assets will offer crypto custody services in compliance with the regulatory requirements of Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin), the leading German business daily Handelsblatt reported. To be able to do so, the entity is going to apply with Bafin for one of the newly introduced licenses for custodial activities in 2020. Cryptocurrency storage solutions will be the new company’s main product at the initial stage but the subsidiary plans to expand its offerings in the future. Michael Offermann, Managing Director of Solarisbank’s Blockchain Factory, told the newspaper:

We have been working intensively on crypto custody for a year and a half. With the new regulation, a good time has come to start. After all, we are not a research institute but a commercial bank.

Bringing Fundamental Change to the Financial Market

According to the publication, Solarisbank will remain true to its well established approach to provide white label solutions. The company will offer the new service only to other financial institutions and business clients while private customers will not be able to open a direct account with the Solaris Digital Assets subsidiary. “So far, we have done well with our focus on business customer offerings. Our partners keep in contact with end customers and that should remain so,” Offermann stressed.

The Solarisbank executive believes that digital assets will fundamentally change the financial market. “As soon as the purchase and safekeeping of bitcoin and company becomes easier, we expect strong growth,” he added. Michael Offermann described the decision to create a separate entity instead of offering crypto custody directly through Solarisbank as a good move in case the regulatory environment in Germany changes again.

Since its establishment about three years ago, the fintech company has more than tripled its revenues to €7.4 million in 2018. At the end of last year, Solarisbank’s balance sheet totaled €120 million, Handelsblatt remarks. Its success is part of the rapid development of the crypto banking sector in the past few months and years that led to the introduction of a variety of new services in the space. Platforms like Cred, for example, offer bitcoin enthusiasts an opportunity to earn up to 10% on their BTC and BCH holdings through custodial services.

Another German startup that’s been working on a new crypto storage product is the Potsdam-based Finoa, which already operates as a crypto depository and claims to be serving over 50 professional investors. The company hopes to receive a provisional license from Bafin around the end of the year and, like Solarisbank, is going to apply for a full crypto custody license in 2020.

That’s the highest in at least two years according to a recent report by CoinShares Research.

Skeptics like economist Nouriel Roubin often claim there is a massive centralization of power among miners and the blockchain is not even close to decentralization and democracy. That the majority of bitcoin’s hashrate is being supplied by China adds weight to their charges.

The hashrate refers to the computing power dedicated to mine blocks and secure the network. At press time, bitcoin’s hashrate stands at 91.34 exa hashes per second (EH/s), according to bitfinfocharts.com.

It is likely the world’s second-largest economy has the biggest influence on the top cryptocurrency. If a couple of big Chinese miners were to switch off, the hashrate will likely drop sharply, making the network less secure.

The majority of bitcoin mining power resides in China mainly due to natural factors. A mining market analyst at bitcoin asset manager and trading platform RRMine, who asked not to be named, told CoinDesk:

“China is a large country and there are many poorly developed areas with low-price, abundant electricity, such as Xinjiang, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia and Sichuan. As we all know, electricity costs and mining machines are two important factors for mining costs, so mining companies and individual miners prefer setting up mines in China.”

Half of the global mining power is located in Sichuan, which has an ample supply of cheap hydroelectricity.

Further, major improvements have been made in the mining hardware over the last year or so and most of that has been predominantly installed in China, according to CoinShare’s Chris Bendiksen.

The upgraded hardware includes the likes of Bitmain’s Antminer 15 and 17 series and MicroBT’s Whatsminer 10 and 20 series, which work significantly faster to produce as much as five times the hashrate per unit as their predecessors.

China’s hashrate dominance will likely fall in the long run, as the latest generation hardware is expected to make an entry into the non-Chinese market. Meanwhile, politically stable and well-connected countries like Norway, with abundant hydropower potential, are likely to become mining powerhouses.

Bitmain is already building the world’s largest bitcoin mining farm in Texas, which has abundant power resources.

Global hashrate to rise ahead of halving

The hashrate has risen sharply from 50 EH/s in June to 91 EH/s at press time, having peaked at 100 EH/s in October.

The surge in bitcoin’s required computing power was fueled by its price rally from $4,000 to $13,000 in the four months preceding July. Miners’ willingness to use high-power mining machines and expectations of further price rally ahead of the May 2020 reward halving also upped the hashrate, according to RRMine analysts.

The halving will reduce the reward per block mined from current 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC. Miners, therefore, would want to mine as many bitcoins as possible before the reward is reduced substantially in May.

Further, RRMine analysts are expecting the price to peak and boost mining profitability ahead of halving. It’s worth noting that historically, bitcoin has put on a good show in the six months leading up to the supply-cutting event.",2019-12-13 20:28:30+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/searching-for-synthetix-which-token-will-be-next-years-50x-winner/,"Searching for Synthetix: Which Token Will Be Next Year’s 50x Winner?

If you bought synthetix (SNX) this time last year, you don’t need to read these words. You’re already rich after your moon bag lived up to its billing and pulled a 50x. Despite the era of undiscovered gems tapering off in 2018, there’s still a handful of tokens that achieve the impossible each year, making their holders ridiculously rich. Seele, synthetix, and link were among this year’s biggest winners. Which tokens will be next to 50x in 2020?

Digging for for Diamonds in the Dirt

Glancing at this year’s best performing coins, as recorded by Coincodex, you could be forgiven for thinking astute investors were all presently sunning themselves on tropical islands, purchased with the proceeds from their ETM, with its 700 million percent gains.

The reality, of course, is less glamorous: there were few buy-and-hold winning trades this year, and the coins that proved profitable had actual tradable volume, unlike En-Tan-Mo and Dragonvein with their sick percentage gains but $0 market cap.

Filter Coincodex’s year-to-date (YTD) returns for the top 200 assets and the picture becomes clearer. Top of the heap, with an impressive 3,417% return, is seele, whose YTD chart looks like this:

Zoom out to when seele was issued the year before, however, and its chart looks like this:

As Bruce Wayne’s butler, Alfred, mused in The Dark Knight Rises: “There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness. Sometimes the pit sends something back.” In 2019, the pit of dead ICO tokens threw something back in the form of seele, which got market made to the max on Huobi, resulting in the most impressive YTD gains of any top 200 asset. To misquote Vitalik Buterin, “Congrats on this Seele. Seriously.”

If You Bought ‘Molecular Future’ This Year, Take a Bow

Aside from seele’s rocket ride from ignominity to the moon, a handful of other tokens recorded triple or quadruple percentage gains in 2019 – and some were even achieved on the basis of fundamentals, rather than exchange-related jiggery pokery. Molecular future (MOF) is something of a mystery, but it was pumped hard on Okex, resulting in a price of $1.58 per token and a YTD gain of 3,280%. Impressive.

In third place comes defi favorite synthetix (SNX), perhaps this year’s overall winner given that its trajectory hasn’t been reliant on any single exchange. For a token that started the year at $0.03 and is currently trading for $1.27, SNX must down as one of this year’s best buys – and with the decentralized derivatives platform now the second largest defi protocol, with $170M locked into its ecosystem, Synthetix would appear to have a promising future. Just don’t count on it doing another 50x next year.

Other tokens that have had a very good 2019 include Constellation’s DAG, up 720%, and chainlink, up 600%. After that, the quality and gains of the top performing coins diminishes sharply. Whatever next year’s market brings, be it bull or bear, a handful of coins are likely to pull a seele and go 50x. But which? Picking 2-3 winners out of 3,500 tokens is a shot in the dark that’s almost certain to fail. That didn’t stop news.Bitcoin.com from polling a number of traders and industry insiders on next year’s likeliest to succeed coins. Here are their picks.

Arweave

If any project has a chance of emulating Seele and going from obscurity to mainstream awareness long after its token sale has concluded, it might just be Arweave. Its token sale ended in June 2018 and the AR token has yet to reach a major exchange – Bilaxy is as good as it gets. Despite this, the Arweave mainnet has been up and running since the start of the year, and its team intensively shipping code, organizing hackathons and raising awareness of its permaweb for archiving information, from websites to tweets.

In November, Arweave revealed it had secured funding from a16z crypto, Union Square Ventures, and Multicoin Capital, who have taken tokens as part of their stake in the project. Arweave appears to be that rare thing: a blockchain project solving a genuine problem – namely broken links and disappearing web content. It’s got the team, the VC backing, and the infrastructure in place. Now all Arweave needs is some liquidity for its AR token for beautiful things to happen.

Kleros

Justice as a Service project Kleros also had a busy year, rolling out useful products such as a generalized token curated registry (TCR). This enables anyone to create their own list of vetted vendors, merchants, products, services or places, with crowd wisdom used to gauge the validity of each entry. From rating restaurants to darknet marketplaces, the potential uses for Kleros’ TCR are vast.

That alone won’t cause the value of its PNK token to rocket, but other developments might. Kleros, which was singled out for praise by Vitalik Buterin this year, is currently building out Proof of Humanity with Democracy Earth, a process for establishing identity without relying on central authorities. Perhaps more importantly, from an investor perspective, Kleros is selling the second tranche of its tokens in January, setting PNK up nicely for a year of price discovery.

Elrond

As a Binance IEO, Elrond needs no introduction – even if most of those who’ve traded it have no idea what the project actually does. It’s a high speed interoperable blockchain basically – nothing new there, admittedly. However, Elrond does have a couple of things in its favor: for one thing, ERD is a low sat coin (currently trading for 28 sats), and for another its mainnet is about to launch. Coupled with the Binance factor, it seems reasonable to predict price appreciation for ERD next year. Not 50x, but 2x perhaps, and in the current climate, that’s a respectable return.

Pegnet and Nyzo

The final two tips for 2020 come courtesy of a crypto whale who would prefer to remain anonymous. His moon bags for 2020 include Nyzo, a collaborative verification project that uses a queueing system instead of PoW or PoS, and Pegnet (PEG), an open source, mineable stablecoin network which is currently only available on Citex exchange.

The odds of any of the tokens mentioned here pulling a 50x next year are vanishingly small, yet that won’t stop a small band of believers from trying their luck with these and hundreds of other mid- and microcap coins. One of them’s got to come in, right?

According to State Street Corporation, 94% of the 101 large asset managers and owners who responded said they either have digital assets under management or are planning to add them in 2020.

More than one third (38%) said they plan to increase their holdings. Another 45% will at least maintain their current investments. Only 6% are not planning to invest in digital assets.

The respondents were from large firms, primarily those with at least $100 billion in assets under management, said Brendan Paul, a State Street spokesperson. With $2.95 trillion in assets under management and $32.9 trillion under custody, State Street is the 12th largest U.S. bank, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“The survey supports what we have anecdotally believed for some time—the future is bright for… [firms planning to] increase allocations to digital assets-related investments,” said Nadine Chakar, global head of State Street’s Global Markets business unit, in a statement. “It’s an exciting time for technology and innovation in the industry, and ultimately investors will benefit from new technologies and a wider range of choices for constructing portfolios.”

The tokens are coming

Tokenizing traditional assets on a blockchain will cause massive market disruption within five years, 45% of the asset managers surveyed predicted. It will also democratize investing for retail investors, 36% believe.

The respondents cited a number of big benefits from tokenizing assets, most notably improving risk management (62%) and transparency (55%). Enhanced security was also mentioned by 55% of the respondents.

Despite that, State Street also reported that “55% say tokenized assets’ inherent risks are too great for widespread institutional adoption.”

Only 4 percent of those surveyed saw no benefit to tokenization, according to the release.

Bullish on an ETF

A majority of the respondents—55%—predicted that U.S. regulators will approve a bitcoin or cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2020.

That’s a distinctly bullish position, given Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton’s recent comments on the subject.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton discussing Bitcoin at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference, September 19, 2019 (via YouTube.com / CNBC).

Speaking at the Discovering Alpha conference on Sept. 19, Clayton was blunt.

The SEC would have to be confident that investors will be able to find a fair and honest price for bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, Clayton said.

“People see the price of bitcoin trading on whatever report it is,” Clayton noted. “If they think there’s the same rigor around that price discovery as there is on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange, and the protections, they are sorely mistaken.”

For an ETF to be approved, he said, “we have to get to a place where we can be confident that trading is better regulated.”

Blockchain goes big

When it comes to investing in trading technology in 2020, blockchain and the distributed ledger technology (DLT) it is built on will be even bigger than artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, according to the asset managers and owners surveyed.

Fully 62% said blockchain and DLT would be a key area of investment, while 50% said that about AI and machine learning, State Street reported.

Another 65% said they believe DLT will improve future financing solutions, compared to 59% that said that about AI.",2019-12-13 10:00:45+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/lagarde-sees-demand-for-stablecoins-plans-to-put-ecb-ahead-of-the-curve/,"Lagarde Sees Demand for Stablecoins, Plans to Put ECB 'Ahead of the Curve'

At her first press conference as head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde outlined her plans to lead the ECB “ahead of the curve” in the field of digital currency. “There is clearly a demand out there that we have to respond to,” she said, referring to stablecoins.

Lagarde’s Plans to Put ECB ‘Ahead of the Curve’

New European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde talked about her digital currency plans while explaining other monetary policy decisions at her first news conference as head of the ECB on Thursday. The press conference followed a meeting of policymakers in Frankfurt where the topic of central bank digital currencies was reportedly discussed. In answering questions regarding the Eurosystem’s digital currency, Lagarde said:

My personal conviction is that given the developments we are seeing, not so much in the bitcoin segment, but in the stablecoins projects … we had better be ahead of the curve if that happens. Because there is clearly a demand out there that we have to respond to.

Regarding stablecoins, she also noted: “we only know of one at the moment but there are others being explored and underway.” While the new ECB chief did not name the stablecoin she was referring to, an ECB Occasional Paper Series report published in August entitled “In search for stability in cryptoassets: are stablecoins the solution?” discusses a number of stablecoins including Facebook’s libra, tether, and nubits.

Lagarde also revealed that the ECB has set up a digital currency task force and will accelerate its digital coin efforts, drawing on research by the eurozone’s central banks that have spent resources on studying central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). She proceeded to outline her plans.

“We will identify number one the purpose that we have with that,” the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief explained. “Are we trying to reduce cost? Are we trying to cut out the middleman? Are we trying to have inclusive finance at no cost? There’s a whole range of objectives that can be pursued. So I think we will start by doing that.” Next, she elaborated, “we will identify the technicalities of it all, which is not a given, particularly when you talk about the Euro system.” The new ECB president concluded:

I think we’re trying to do that by mid-2020.

ECB’s Own Digital Currency

The ECB has also reportedly been looking into the prospect of issuing its own digital currency that would give the holders direct claims on the central bank. Several countries have similarly increased their efforts in this area following the announcement of the Libra project in June by Facebook, which was met with resistance from many regulators. The European Council and the European Commission jointly issued a statement last week stating that “no global ‘stablecoin’ arrangement should begin operation in the European Union until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks have been adequately identified and addressed.” Furthermore, the ECB indicated last week that it will develop its own digital currency if the private sector cannot make cross-border payments faster and cheaper.

At the aforementioned press conference, Lagarde also talked about the Eurosystem’s existing digital payment frameworks: TIPS (TARGET Instant Payment Settlement) and PEPSI (The Pan European Payment System Initiative). “We have several items that are completely digitalized that are not at the front end, and that the bank’s clients do not perceive as being in operation,” she asserted. “They deliver in digital terms the operations of clearing and settling, sometimes in one single operation,” she added, emphasizing that through these systems, “settlement and clearing are actually taking place instantly.” Noting that some countries are not using the systems, she affirmed that she “will continue to push” for their usage.

Progress on Central Bank Digital Currencies

Several countries worldwide have been studying the prospect of introducing their own central bank digital currency, as news.Bitcoin.com previously reported. China, for example, has said several times that it is working on a digital yuan. While the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said that there is no timetable for issuing one, there are reports that the Chinese government is preparing to test its digital currency.

“I think there is also great interest outside our regional area. I know for instance that Canada, the U.K., other countries way beyond are certainly looking deeply into that to see if it makes sense, what purpose it serves and how we can best deliver on it,” Lagarde said at the Thursday press conference. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has suggested that a global central bank digital currency might replace the dollar as the international reserve currency one day.

However, some countries do not see the benefits of issuing their own central bank digital currencies just yet. In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said that they do not see a need to create a digital dollar, at least for the next five years. Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve is studying the costs and benefits of issuing one. The Bank of Japan has recently released a study on the legal impact of such currency but concluded that the bank is not looking to issue one currently. South Korea is another country that is taking a wait-and-see approach.

The company confirmed to CNN the letter was genuine.

Many of the digital currencies held by Quadriga are stored offline in accounts known as ""cold wallets,"" a way of protecting them from hackers. Cotten was the only person with access to the wallets, according to the company.

Bottle Pay, a cryptocurrency payments provider from the U.K., has announced its decision to cease operations by the end of the year. Despite attracting some serious funding and expanding its user base significantly in the past few months, the company has found it unacceptable to continue to work under the upcoming EU regulations. AMLD5, the latest update of the EU’s anti-money laundering policy, introduces stringent requirements for crypto businesses.

Bottle Pay Shuts Down Because of New KYC Rules

As a custodial crypto wallet provider based in the United Kingdom, Bottle Pay will be obliged to comply with stricter regulations to be introduced with the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive of the European Union. AMLD5 comes into effect January 2020 and has to be transposed into national law by all EU member states. It expands the coverage of the relevant legislation to include the crypto space imposing extensive KYC and AML practices.

“After having built a fantastic community around our service, and seeing huge growth in user numbers over the last few months,” the British company remarked in a blog post published on Friday, “it is with heavy hearts that we announce Bottle Pay will cease operating on Tuesday 31st December 2019 at 13:00 GMT,” the announcement details.

Bottle Pay shuts down after raising $2 million in seed funding this past September. The startup, which was launched in June, developed a tipping service that allowed users to send small amounts of cryptocurrency on social media networks and messengers through its browser extension for Chrome, Firefox and Brave.

A recipient’s social media account or a handle was all the sender needed to transfer the digital cash. Bottle Pay was available on multiple platforms including Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, Github, Discord, and Reddit. Money sent to users of these networks will now be returned to the sender within a week. Active users have to withdraw their funds by Dec. 31 and new subscriptions will not be accepted as signups and deposits went offline this week.

In the blog post, Bottle Pay further emphasizes that “the amount and type of extra personal information we would be required to collect from our users would alter the current user experience so radically, and so negatively, that we are not willing to force this onto our community.” The company wants to maintain its integrity as a service provider and protect the interests of its team, investors and users. “We have taken the painful decision to shut Bottle Pay down completely rather than become subject to these new regulations,” the startup concludes.

What’s Special About AMLD5

The European Union regularly updates its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework. AMLD5 is its latest edition. The directive was adopted and published in 2018 and will come into force on Jan. 10, 2020. One of its key features is the expansion of its scope to encompass crypto activities within the EU.

AMLD5 addresses regulatory challenges related to high value goods, prepaid cards, high-risk countries, and politically exposed persons as well as the legal treatment of virtual currencies. It introduces a legal definition of cryptocurrency which has been described as “a digital representation of value that can be digitally transferred, stored or traded and is accepted as a medium of exchange.”

Providers of crypto-related services, such as exchanges and custodial wallets, are considered “obliged entities” and will have to comply with the union’s AML regulations in the future. That means abiding by the rules applicable to other financial institutions including the obligation to perform customer due diligence and submit suspicious activity reports. That also applies to investment firms, tax advisors, accountants, notaries, and lawyers who transfer or receive payments equivalent to €10,000 and more.

Crypto companies will have to register with the respective authorities in their jurisdictions such as Bafin in Germany or Britain’s FCA. What’s more, the financial intelligence units of member states have been authorized to obtain the private data of virtual currency owners and users, including their identities and addresses. The information will be kept in central registries and will allow the identification of both private individuals and corporate entities holding accounts with crypto platforms. Brussels’ main goal is to reduce anonymity associated with crypto transactions and use.

However, for the sceptics out there, these successes are far outweighed by the market’s high-profile setbacks.

From rampant scams and fraud through to hundreds of so-called dead coins, there is certainly a lot of evidence to back up the doomsdayers’ claims that the value of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies will eventually fall to zero.

But is the model really doomed? And if so, why is cryptocurrency failing?

Cryptocurrency successes

The cryptocurrency model is facing numerous challenges, but its successes to date cannot be overlooked. By far the biggest success story in crypto’s somewhat short history is Bitcoin.

Despite being launched only a decade ago, a single Bitcoin today is worth an impressive four figures – or $7,200 at the time of writing. And although Bitcoin experienced a huge crash in early 2018, there are signs to suggest its volatility is abating.

Bitcoin, and other major cryptocurrencies too, have hit significant adoption and usage milestones. In April, for instance, the 400 millionth transaction was recorded by Bitcoin’s public blockchain.

Some people believe cryptocurrencies will soon go mainstream, pointing to their adoption by major financial institutions, technology firms, and other corporations around the world.

Blockchain, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies, is seeing even wider acceptance among companies in a range of sectors and industries.

Cryptocurrency failures

At the same time, however, the crypto market has witnessed some monumental failures. According to Deadcoins.com, there are around 1,000 “deceased” coins and another 700 coins that have fallen victim to scams.

Many coins were launched to great fanfare during the Bitcoin bubble but simply failed to live up to their hype.

The market has also witnessed high-profile thefts, hacks, scams, and regulatory crackdowns, which have severely tarnished its reputation and credibility.

Why is cryptocurrency failing?

A major problem in the crypto market is the lack of innovation by developers. There have been multiple launches of “the new Bitcoin” despite the fact that Bitcoin is still heavily in demand. Since the market doesn’t need a new Bitcoin, these coins inevitably fail.

According to Gavin Brown and Richard Whittle at Manchester Metropolitan University, another somewhat ironic issue stems from the acceptance of crypto by financial institutions.

“Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalising trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products,” they argue.

“We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design.”

Many other cryptocurrencies could fail in the future simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions.

Another potential consequence of crypto entering the mainstream could be more stringent regulation, which only serves to stifle growth and innovation.

Yet perhaps the market’s biggest problem is its failure to garner trust among the general public. Many people have lost enormous amounts of money – either because they invested more than they should have in the Bitcoin bubble or because they have fallen victim to scams or hacks.

Whilst too much regulation is thought to be bad for the crypto market, the lack of it thus far, combined with a general lack of understanding and awareness among the public, is likely to lead to even more people losing their hard-earned money in the future.

Conclusion

The cryptocurrency model certainly has a lot of problems to overcome, but this doesn’t necessarily mean it is doomed to fail.

New coins are being launched all the time – there are around 3,000 currently in existence – and several of these are proving to be a huge success. Prices are still volatile, but the sector as a whole is much more stable than it was in the past.

As the sector starts to mature, it’s likely we’ll see even wider adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology by individuals and companies around the globe.

With that will come increased understanding of cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity, which will hopefully help to minimise the huge losses suffered by unsuspecting members of the public.",2019-12-14 11:00:14+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/bloxroute-releases-blockchain-distribution-network-for-ethereum-and-bitcoin-cash/,"Bloxroute Releases Blockchain Distribution Network for Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash

On December 3, the crypto software firm Bloxroute’s cofounder, Eyal Markovich, announced the launch of the startup’s Blockchain Distribution Network (BDN) Version 1. Markovich explained that the BDN V1 release is a milestone for the company and the scalability service aims to enable exponential blockchain scaling by propagating blocks and transactions faster.

The Blockchain Distribution Network Version 1

The startup Bloxroute, a firm dedicated to blockchain propagation software, recently revealed the launch of BDN V1. The protocol is a “Layer-0 blockchain scalability solution” and Bloxroute’s Markovich detailed that developers have been working “tirelessly” toward the effort. News.Bitcoin.com first reported on Bloxroute back in November 2018, after the Bitcoin Cash blockchain split. After BSV split off from the BCH network, both communities heavily debated how miners and nodes would handle massive sized blocks in the future. At the time, Bloxroute was brought up in these debates quite a bit, because the startup claims the BDN can provide more efficient block propagation for blockchains.

“In particular, Bloxroute propagates blocks without knowledge of the transactions they contain, their number, and the ‘wallets’ or addresses involved. Miners are free to include arbitrary transactions in a block,” the Bloxroute whitepaper explains.

Since then Bloxroute has been experimenting with multiple blockchains and recent tests include the ETH Mining Test, Bitcoin Cash Miner Test, and the Akomba Labs Test. The results from the Bitcoin Cash Miner Test, in particular, had shown that “BDN propagates large blocks (32MB) between 2-18 seconds compared to up to 193 seconds without Bloxroute.”

“Block compression technology, such as Compact blocks, improved with the BDN as transaction propagation allowed mempools to be more in sync,” the report highlights. Additionally, China saw the “largest improvement” in propagation times and BDN “sped up fork recoveries,” like missed transactions from compact blocks. Bloxroute has been working with mining pools as well and news.Bitcoin.com reported about one partnership last January when the firm partnered with the mining operation Rawpool.

‘Any Blockchain Project Can Integrate With Bloxroute’

For the latest BDN V1 Gateway software, Markovich details that the protocol is available via Github, Dockerhub, and Pypi. Markovich also notes that Bloxroute expects to see exchanges, decentralized apps, and mining pools adopt BDN V1. People can get a comprehensive overview of the architecture, components, and installation walkthroughs by visiting Bloxroute’s documentation page.

“Later this year, we will publish a more technical post on the content of V1 and on the BDN roadmap for 2020,” Markovich said. Additionally, Bloxroute’s website shows a list of blockchain partners who plan to leverage the BDN software. Bloxroute is also backed by investment firms such as Pantera, Coinbase Ventures, Fenbushi, and well known individuals like Fred Ehrsam, and Jack Herrick. In addition to detailing that a technical post and BDN roadmap was in the works, Markovich’s blog post emphasized that “any blockchain project can integrate with Bloxroute.”

“While the first version of the Blockchain Distribution Network (BDN) supports Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, we are also working to integrate the BDN with a number of new blockchain projects including Ontology, Quorum, Conflux, and Metadium,” Markovich added.

According to regional reports, the Russian darknet market Hydra is planning an initial coin offering (ICO) in order to expand the marketplace internationally. The sale is set to start on December 16 and Hydra administrators hope to raise $146 million from the token sale.

Hydra ICO Plans to Raise $146 Million

The top darknet market (DNM) famous among Russian speaking users is hosting a token sale in a few days. The Hydra marketplace has been around since 2015 and the DNM claims to have 2.5 million active users with 100,000 daily transactions. The columnist Anna Baydakova discovered Hydra’s investment memorandum, which can only be accessed with an anonymized browser like Tor. Baydakova details that the Hydra ICO will sell tokens for $100 each and users can purchase them with BTC. Moreover, Baydakova’s report highlights that investors who purchase 100 tokens will get a 0.00333333 percent share from Hydra’s profits. The regional publication Forklog is warning people about Hydra’s ICO and the news outlet has cautioned readers by saying the Hydra crowdsale “may be an exit-scam attempt by project management.”

Forklog notes that Hydra is the largest DNM in Russia selling narcotic substances but counterfeit money and other prohibited goods are not allowed. The report also suggests that Hydra has an issue with the Lenta.ru news publication, which launched a large-scale investigation into Hydra and the RAMP marketplace. Forklog discloses that according to available data, 49% of the tokens will be sold and Baydakova’s report also confirms the public sale number. The rest of the funds will be kept by Hydra admins and the DNM’s representatives said they will be funding an investigation into the Lenta.ru news publication.

The news outlet’s inquiry into the Russian DNM has a lot of evidence against Hydra’s operations. The investigative report explains how Hydra’s shadow market has a turnover of billions of rubles. Despite the fact that Hydra’s revenue outpaces sales in Russia for oil and gas, Lenta.ru news says “no newspapers write about it.” Moreover, the creation of Hydra started a “brutal war” in Russia for the drug trade on the internet and Lenta.ru suggests that Hydra became a “monopolist in the multi-billion-dollar market.” Global law enforcement has recently been following and tracking Hydra’s operations and on January 15, 2019, investigators fell upon several hundred tons of bananas and each container of fruit contained 50-kilogram briquettes of cocaine. The banana shipment had 500 million rubles worth of cocaine and it was suspected that the drugs stemmed from Hydra operations. The following June, DNM investigators seized even more banana containers that held 400 kilograms of cocaine from the Alava cartel at the St. Petersburg seaport.

Trusting an ICO That Could Literally Be Gone Tomorrow

As far as Hydra’s ICO is concerned, the 49% issued to the public will represent 1,470,000 tokens. Not only will funding help the investigation into Lenta.ru, Hydra admins are also allegedly planning to use the money to fund a project called Eternos. Reports detail that Eternos will be another DNM but will also host a digital asset exchange, encrypted messenger services, and it will supposedly run on a native anonymous browser. The 100-token package buyers will ostensibly get “$500 monthly dividends” and Hydra admins have estimated these numbers from “Hydra’s [prior] growth metrics.” Forklog says that Vladimir Todorov, the editor-in-chief of Lenta.ru news, disclosed that messages from Hydra admins “do not contain a single word of truth.”

After the news about Hydra’s ICO went viral, DNM participants discussed the subject on social media and forums. “LOL — yeah right — Imagine trusting a websites ICO that could literally be gone tomorrow,” one person commented on the Reddit forum r/darknet. Others wrote things like “Bitconnnneeeeeeect” and a few commentators explained that DNMs have done ICO-like shares in the past.

“A few months before Evolution market exit scammed, I remember they made a shares system a little similar to this — Very profitable system for Evolution admins I guess,” the person recollected.

Metal wallets are a reliable way to store Bitcoin for a long period of time. These wallets are simple metal plates that hold a seed phrase – a string of words that can be used to recover a Bitcoin address. Typically, metal wallets are used to back up deposit-only addresses that have never been used for payments. Additionally, they can be used to back up active Bitcoin addresses as well. ⁠

Most metal wallets share the same basic qualities: they’re designed to withstand fires, floods, extreme pressure, and other harsh conditions. However, not all metal wallets are designed equally. Some are much more durable than others. Some provide better protection against tampering, or feature greater simplicity. With that in mind, here are ten of the best metal wallets on the market today.

Best Engravable Plate: Crypto Key Stack

It’s hard to go wrong with engravable (or stampable) metal plates, as they have no component parts that can be destroyed or displaced. Crypto Key Stack is one of the best wallets in this category: Jameson Lopp, the CTO of CasaHODL, tested the product and found that its engravings are highly legible even after damage. It is affordable as well: Crypto Key Stack’s $45 price tag includes an engraving tool and a 12-word metal plate.

Best Grid Plates: Blockplate and Steelwallet

Grid plates represent seed words in a different way. Each letter is represented by a punched hole instead of a written letter. This system is not easy to read at a glance, but it makes it hard to confuse one word for another. Lopp’s tests have found that both Blockplate and Steelwallet are quite damage-resistant. Both companies charge about $65 for two 12-word plates that provide room for 24 seed words.

Best Metal Rod: Coldbit Passphrase

Metal rods are another variation on engravable wallets. Coldbit Passphrase is one highly affordable wallet of this type. Each rod is approximately $20 and provides enough space for 24-36 words. Coldbit stamp sets cost extra, but any stamp set or engraving tool should work. Lopp’s tests demonstrated that Coldbit Passphrase is very resistant to fire and pressure. However, he did note that the product is vulnerable to corrosion.

Best Keychain: Crypto Keys

Crypto Keys offers an engravable wallet with a unique look: each small plate resembles a “key” and is designed to hold two words. Since this design uses space efficiently, the product is quite affordable. A $28 set includes thirteen double-sided “keys” with room for 24 words, plus a stamp set. A with most other engravable metal plates, Crypto Keys held up extremely well during testing.

Best Insertable Tile Wallet: Simbit

Some metal wallets are not engravable. Instead, they rely on a rail system to hold insertable letter tiles in place. This design, however, does not hold up well during testing. Testing revealed that fire and pressure tend to cause the letters to fall out of place. Lopp did note one exception: the Simbit wallet held up exceptionally well. The $110 product offers enough space for a 24-word passphrase.

Best Capsule Wallet: Quadrat Register

Capsule wallets use stacked tiles to keep their contents in order. This can be a very durable design. Lopp found that Quadrat Register held up better than nearly all other metal wallets. Unfortunately, Quadrat Register is expensive – it costs approximately $330, plus $155 for a protective capsule. This device uses a complicated dot-code system to represent seed words, which is not particularly user-friendly.

Best Tamper-proof Wallet: CypherWheel

Few hardware wallets offer tamper-proof features, and those that do typically make use of basic seals and envelopes. CypherWheel goes one step further. It’s tamper-proof design includes a seal with a security number and the device can be locked with a padlock. Internally, CypherWheel uses slotted insertable tiles. The $200 product held up fairly well during Lopp’s tests, though it was somewhat susceptible to corrosion.

Best Prefab Wallet: Bitkee

Some manufacturers print wallet details directly on their product. Bitkee sells a $40 customizable metal plate featuring laser-engraved private keys, public keys, QR codes, and a logo of your choice. Bitkee’s order form also supports encrypted private keys, which prevent the company from accessing your funds. Like most metal plates, Bitkee is highly resistant to damage, according to test results.

Best Physical Coin: Denarium

Physical Bitcoins, though they are made of metal, are not made to last. Lopp has shown that at least one brand became illegible during testing. However, Denarium coins are a decent choice. Though they do not claim to be durable, they provide redundancy: each coin includes an internal private key, which is duplicated in a QR code. Denarium also offers multisig to prevent the company from accessing your funds. Prices begin at approximately $26.

Best DIY Material: 316L Stainless Steel

It is possible to simply buy a plate of metal and engrave it yourself. Bulletproof Bitcoin suggests that users “order a simple stainless steel or titanium plate from eBay and punch it.” Though titanium has a slightly higher melting point, 316L stainless steel is several times cheaper, making it a good option for investors on a budget.

Other Considerations

Metal wallet testing is usually far more intense than any realistic scenario. Lopp subjected metal wallets to temperatures above 2000°F, highly corrosive acid, and direct pressure. Realistically, metal wallets might face 1100°F house fires, moisture and humidity, and possibly damage from building debris.

This means that it is not a good idea to focus on durability to the point of ignoring security threats. Most metal wallets cannot prevent other people from accessing your cryptocurrency. If you lose your wallet, you should move your funds to a new wallet address immediately. Similarly, it is extremely easy to lose small metal wallets, so it is a good idea to keep secondary backups as well.

Finally, compatibility is important. Usually, it is impossible to retrieve a seed phrase if your funds are stored on an exchange. You will need to withdraw your funds to a software wallet or hardware wallet, generate your seed phrase, then engrave it on your metal wallet. You can find wallets that support various standards here – and making a note of your choice will make it easier to restore your funds in the future.

If you intend to hold a sizeable stash of Bitcoin for the ages, then an investment in a doomsday wallet is warranted.

There are many patterns worth learning and understanding — some of the most essential bearish patterns are discussed below. It is important to note, once again, that context and candle placement are essential in identifying patterns.

The same exact candlestick can be bullish when located in a different place on the chart.

Bearish Harami

The Bearish Harami is a two candle pattern that signals a likely reversal in price. In this pattern, the first candle is large and green and is followed by a red candle with a smaller body.

To be valid, the second candle must be completely within the range of the body of the first candle. Another notable version of this pattern is the Bearish Harami Cross, where the second candle is a perfect doji.

In Japanese, the term “Harami” is the word for pregnant. In this pattern, the green candlestick is the “mother” and the small candlestick is the “baby.”

Dark Cloud Cover

Price action following this pattern is often as ominous as its name, Dark Cloud Cover. This is another 2 candle pattern that signals a likely bearish reversal at the top of a bullish movement. The first candle is generally large, always green, and is followed by a similar red candle.

The second candle opens with a gap up to a fresh high but closes the session more than halfway into the body of the first day’s candle. This is a signal that bears have dominated the session, pushing the price down with the intention of following through on future candles.

The Evening Star

The Evening Star is a bearish reversal pattern that appears at the top of an uptrend with a large bullish candle, followed by a gap up to a small-bodied candle and a gap down to a red candle that closes below the midpoint of the first day.

The first candlestick in the evening star must be green and have a relatively large real body. The second candlestick is the star, which has a short real body that does not touch the real body of the first candle — it is the gap between the real bodies of the two candlesticks that makes a doji or a spinning top qualify as an evening star.

This pattern is confirmed by the candlestick that follows the star, which must be a red candle that closes well into the body of the first candlestick.

In legacy markets, there must be gaps between each of the candles. However, since crypto trades 24/7 and gaps are rare, some technical analysts argue that this pattern is still valid without the gaps.

Shooting Star

Similar to the previously discussed patterns, the shooting star is a bearish reversal pattern. This two candle pattern appears during an uptrend and signals an upcoming reversal to a bearish bias.

The first candle is green, followed by a green or red candle that has a long upper wick and small body. The second candle looks like an inverted hammer, which is bullish when located at the bottom of a trend.

The long wick as an indication that bulls controlled much of the session, before losing ground to bears, who pushed the price back down to close near the daily open. This is a signal that price depreciation is likely and is confirmed when followed by a bearish candle.

Hanging Man

The Hanging Man is a single candle pattern that indicates a likely reversal from bullish price action to bearish price action. This candle has a long lower shadow and a small body and appears at the top of a trend or during an uptrend.

Once again, when this candle is at the bottom of a downtrend, it is called a hammer and signals a bullish reversal — context matters. This candle shows that sellers were able to take control during a portion of the period. It indicates that bears defended the current price and are likely to continue selling through the subsequent candle.

You should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.coindesk.com/the-great-crypto-experiment-continues,"This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Andy Bromberg is the co-founder and president of CoinList, a platform for token sales. CoinList is also launching a cryptocurrency exchange, and provides compliance and developer engagement services to crypto projects.

Compared to the 2017-18 hype cycle, this was a quiet year for the crypto markets. There was no tidal wave of institutional money or cascade of mass adoption. Regulators gave encouraging crypto guidance while also putting Libra and projects like Kik and Telegram in their crosshairs. And for our business and the larger token sale space, we continued to see investors eager to back quality projects.

In other words, the crypto experiment continued.

In 2019, we saw startups tweak token-based fundraising models in new directions. For instance, Algorand ran a Dutch Auction sale on our platform where participants set and paid a uniform, market-determined price per token to ensure fairness and transparency – some of the core tenets of the project. There were projects like Blockstack that were the first to conduct a Reg A+ token sale. And, we saw projects starting to conduct Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs) in order to provide immediate liquidity for investors.

Public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens.

In other words, token sales survived the crypto winter. In 2017 and early 2018, public token sales were focused on raising large chunks of capital for projects. But based on what we’re seeing today, public sales are increasingly used primarily as a mechanism to distribute tokens to a broad array of stakeholders, with the capital raise being a secondary consideration.

But a lot of the continued viability of crypto projects and token sales alike hinges on the SEC and other regulators.

The crypto community got some mixed messages from DC in 2019. The government went after Libra, fined EOS, filed a lawsuit against Kik, and blocked Telegram from distributing its token. Some members of government were more supportive of crypto – including SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who called for a safe harbor for crypto projects, so tokens meeting specified criteria could be traded more freely, enabling a more open crypto ecosystem. As we approach the new decade, this – and other encouraging signals — give me confidence in the long-term viability and success of token sales.

What does that mean for 2020?

Just as our industry matures and projects experiment with different token sale mechanisms, we’ll see many live network launches – including many projects that raised money on our platform. These live networks will be a proving ground for even more novel crypto ideas.

On the institutional side, don’t expect to see a “wave” of new money come crashing in, but building off of 2019, we expect a gradual, slow-rising tide of institutional capital.

Finally, we’ll continue to see the industry working with the SEC and other regulators to provide clarity, with the aim of avoiding any more companies receiving punishments of the sort meted out this year.",2019-12-14 19:00:00+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/myths-and-realities-sentiment-analysis-for-crypto-assets,"Jesus Rodriguez is the CTO and co-founder of IntoTheBlock, a platform focused on enabling an intelligent infrastructure for the crypto markets, as well as chief scientist of AI firm Invector Labs and an active investor, speaker and author in crypto and artificial intelligence.

One of the established beliefs in the cryptocurrency market is its susceptibility to news and social media. Like any other nascent and still irrational financial market, unexpected developments captured in news or social media tend to impact price. As a result, there is increasing interest in leveraging machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis to detect possible correlations with the price of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens. Despite its importance, most attempts to leverage sentiment analysis are too basic to output any tangible intelligence and quite often produce misleading results.

The challenges of efficiently leveraging sentiment analysis to evaluate the behavior of an asset are not unique to the crypto space. Producing true insights based on textual sentiment is a very difficult task that, most of the time, requires natural language processing (NLP) models optimized for a specific financial domain. Large quantitative hedge funds use armies of machine learning experts to train NLP models in a very specific task like analyzing earning reports in order to get an edge in a medium frequency trade. Efficiently leveraging sentiment analysis for crypto assets requires machine learning depth and rigor.

To understand that statement, let’s start by diving a bit deeper into the characteristics of sentiment analysis methods.

A gentle introduction to sentiment analysis

In Act II, Scene II of the famous play Richelieu; Or the Conspiracy, British playwright Edward Bulwer-Lytton coined a phrase that has transcended generations: “The pen is mightier than the sword.” Centuries after, that famous quote brilliantly encapsulates the importance of sentiment analysis. Emotions in textual communication are sometimes more conducive to actions than physical actions themselves.

Conceptually, sentiment analysis is a subdiscipline of NLP that focuses on identifying the affective states of textual communications. Contrary to popular beliefs, sentiment analysis is not a single technique but rather a subdiscipline of the deep learning space that covers different types of affection detection in textual data. From that perspective, there are several types of sentiment analysis that could be relevant in the context of crypto-asset intelligence:

Polarity Analysis : This type of sentiment analysis ranks textual sentiment in positive, negative and neutral. For instance, the sentence “the bitcoin price rally has reenergized the market” would likely be classified as positive by most models.

: This type of sentiment analysis ranks textual sentiment in positive, negative and neutral. For instance, the sentence “the bitcoin price rally has reenergized the market” would likely be classified as positive by most models. Emotion/Tone Analysis : Instead of an overall qualifier for the text, this type of analysis centers on scoring the different types of emotions present in a particular text. Emotions such as sadness, happiness or anger are a common focus of emotion analysis algorithms. For instance, the sentence “this bitcoin rally is crazy,” will show high levels of excitement and joy.

Emotions such as sadness, happiness or anger are a common focus of emotion analysis algorithms. For instance, the sentence “this bitcoin rally is crazy,” will show high levels of excitement and joy. Aspect Sentiment Analysis: This type of sentiment analysis focuses on interpreting the sentiment about specific subjects within a sentence rather than a sentence as a whole. For instance, in the sentence “Bakkt futures are a major milestone for the bitcoin market,” aspect analysis will determine the sentiment related to “Bakkt futures” instead of the complete sentence.

Looking at the previous list, we can clearly see the benefits of sentiment analysis for crypto assets. However, there are also plenty of challenges that should be considered before venturing into using these types of techniques. Contextualization, subjectivity, irony or even bad grammar are among the factors that can easily trick the best NLP algorithms.

Sentiment analysis for crypto assets

Crypto is a nascent asset class that is still vulnerable to the irrationality of financial markets and the lack of proper disclosure channels. From that perspective, it is only logical to assume NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis can identify alpha or smart beta generator factors to predict the behavior of crypto assets. Reality is a bit different.

When applying sentiment analysis to crypto assets, we are likely to encounter two main types of challenges:

Limitations of mainstream NLP technologies when applied to a domain-specific problem such as crypto asset analysis. Incorrect assumptions about how sentiment is reflected in news and social media.

The first challenge can almost be seen as an unexpected side effect of the rapid growth of NLP technologies. Today, it is relatively easy for a developer to incorporate sentiment analysis into applications using simple APIs that don’t require any deep learning expertise.

While NLP APIs can be effective analyzing the sentiment of a generic sentence, they perform extremely poorly when trying to extrapolate domain-specific knowledge of a specific sentence. For instance, analyzing the sentence “a bitcoin ETF approval could be imminent” requires NLP models that are specialized in the semantics of market-specific terminology and that are able to extrapolate sentiment at a more granular level than from just a sentence.

The second challenge is related to misconceptions about how sentiment is reflected in news and social media commentary. As a source of intelligence, news can be highly informative but quite useless when comes to sentiment analysis. The reason is obvious: the sentiment in well-written news should trend around neutral. Social media behaves in the exact opposite way. Conversations about cryptocurrencies in Twitter or Telegram tend to contain relevant sentiment but, for the most part, are based on a reaction to public material information, which means that they are unlikely to generate any informational edge. Additionally, social media threads tend to be noisy and relatively subjective, which can produce misleading sentiment analysis results.

From a purely technological standpoint, building effective sentiment analysis models for crypto assets requires models trained in the terminology of crypto markets, but that also analyze news as sources of information and social media feeds as amplifiers of sentiment. However, if we get past this technological challenge, we are now faced with one of the biggest psychological misconceptions when comes to sentiment analysis models in the crypto space.

The sentiment-market impact fallacy

The sentiment-market impact fallacy describes a phenomenon that is notorious or irrational, such as nascent financial markets in which investors assume a direct correlation between a sentiment score and a price movement. To explain this behavioral economics dynamic, let’s imagine that you are using an analytics tool that analyze the sentiment of recent bitcoin tweets. Psychologically, most investors are inclined to interpret the sentiment as a leading indicator based on the following rules:

If the sentiment is positive that’s a bullish indicator for the price of bitcoin.

If the sentiment is negative that’s a bearish indicator for the price of bitcoin.

However, if your model is analyzing public, material information, the sentiment should be interpreted as a lagging indicator following some non-intuitive rules:

If the sentiment is positive and the price of bitcoin does not go up, that is a bearish signal.

If the sentiment is negative and the price of bitcoin does not go down, that is a bullish signal.

Being aware of sentiment-price bias positions sentiment analysis not as a leading indicator but as an often relevant factor in a trading strategy.

From sentiment analysis to market impact analysis

From an informational standpoint, the crypto market is noisy and full of unexpected events. In terms of sentiment analysis, that combination of factors is a nightmare. Instead of narrowly focusing on sentiment analysis, we should probably develop a more holistic approach. A sentiment-market impact indicator would be a combination of polarity (negative, positive, neutral), emotion (anxious, excited, sad…) and aspect-based (topics, entities…) analysis over long periods of time. This approach would require the training of models specialized in the dynamics of crypto assets to evaluate the sentiment in the context of specific market conditions.

The idea of sentiment-market impact models is conceptually trivial: quantify the impact that combinations of sentiment, emotions and topics can have on a crypto asset during specific market conditions. Part of the beauty of this approach is that it doesn’t have to be completely unsupervised like most sentiment models today; it can be trained on domain-specific knowledge of crypto markets. For instance, we could train a model to learn that positive articles about Chinese investment in crypto can have a positive impact in a market that had been relatively bearish for the last week. The core principle of sentiment-market impact analysis models would be to contextualize the knowledge of sentiment models to the specifics of the crypto market.",2019-12-14 10:30:48+00:00

China is poised to take the lead in blockchain after it was given strong backing by the country's leader President Xi Jinping, experts told CNBC. The move could allow the world's second-largest economy to control the development of the nascent technology in the absence of competition from other regions like Europe and the U.S. Blockchain refers to a technology which began with the cryptocurrency bitcoin. In that case, its role was an immutable and tamper-proof public ledger of activity. It was also ""decentralized,"" which means it was not owned by any one party. The definition of the technology has since evolved as it started being applied to areas like finance. Other terms such as ""distributed ledger technology"" or DLT are now often used in these cases and they bear differences to the original bitcoin blockchain. But the promise of a system in which transactions can happen across a single record aimed at authentication is still attractive.

In October, Xi gave a speech saying China needs to ""seize the opportunities"" presented by blockchain, in what appeared to be one of the first instances of a major world leader backing the tech. Xi said blockchain is an ""important breakthrough in independent innovation of core technologies."" ""This is an extremely significant development, not just for China but for the broader world,"" Garrick Hileman, head of research at cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform Blockchain. ""Countries are racing to identify strategic technologies and develop sustainable competitive advantages in areas like artificial intelligence and robotics. With Xi's speech blockchain technology can now be added to this list,"" Hileman told CNBC.

China's relationship with crypto

Cryptocurrency trading, like that of bitcoin, is technically banned in China. In 2017, the government banned so-called ""initial coin offerings"" or ICOs. This was a way for start-ups to raise funds by selling off newly-created digital currencies. But not all cryptocurrency activity is totally outlawed. Hileman estimates that over half of all bitcoin and other cryptocurrency mining takes place inside China while millions of citizens own and invest in cryptocurrencies. ""Mining"" is a term which relates to the creation of new bitcoin, and requires specially made computers that use a lot of energy. The Chinese government has never had an issue with the underlying technology — blockchain.

While bitcoin's price soared after Xi's comments, perhaps in hopes that China could loosen its rules on the trading of the digital coin, experts said that's not likely. Instead, Chinese firms will focus on the development of blockchain technology. ""For the foreseeable future, we think (the) Chinese government will insist on pushing the development of blockchain technology, instead of the application of cryptocurrency,"" Lawrence Wintermeyer, co-chair of Global Digital Finance, an industry body that promotes the adoption of digital finance technologies, told CNBC.

What's happening in China?

China has a history of throwing its weight behind key technologies with big announcements about how they should be developed. In 2017, the government laid out a blueprint for how it wants to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030. More recently, China officially launched research and development work for 6G mobile networks, having only just rolled out 5G a week before. This often gives companies the impetus to develop the technology. ""With President Xi's backing blockchain, China has unequivocally said that the future foundation of technology is blockchain, and China will be the first nation to the moon,"" Jehan Chu, co-founder of Kenetic Capital, a trading and investment firm focused on digital assets, told CNBC. ""Within China, there will be waves of innovation at state and local levels, with massive inflows of capital powering innovation like AI (artificial intelligence) and Big Data previously.""

Development of the technology is certainly underway. Since March, over 500 blockchain projects have been registered with the Cyber Administration of China. Some of China's largest internet companies from Tencent to Huawei have registered projects. The technology is still very much in its early stages but is being looked at very closely in a number of areas. Sebastian Markowsky, partner at Blockchain Valley Ventures, said China is looking to apply the technology to areas such as fraud prevention, food safety and its supply chain, as well as using blockchain to track charity donations, among other things.

Hainan test

While Xi has backed blockchain, the government is still taking a fairly measured approach. Hainan, a province in south China, has set up a so-called blockchain pilot zone, with the aim of fostering the development of the technology. Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange, has set up shop in Hainan as has Chinese search giant Baidu. Markowsky compared this to how the Chinese government has operated in the past, designating specific cities or areas of the country as special economic zones. But it also helps mitigate the risk should the technology live up to the hype. ""China has the ability to therefore experiment around blockchain with all the upside, and very limited downside,"" Markowsky said. ""The government has put its name behind the technology, and will continue to do so indirectly (through state-owned enterprises and private enterprises). If blockchain turns out to be the revolution that is promised, they will be able to quickly roll it out in the entirety of the country,"" he said. ""Otherwise, the small Hainan experiment will be shut down, leaving the rest of the country unscathed.""

Blockchain hype

There is certainly a lot of hype around the technology. ""Blockchain technologies have not yet lived up to the hype and most enterprise blockchain projects are stuck in experimentation mode,"" Avivah Litan, research vice president at Gartner, said in a recent report. ""Blockchain is not yet enabling a digital business revolution across business ecosystems and may not until at least 2028, when Gartner expects blockchain to become fully scalable technically and operationally."" The industry, which includes blockchain companies based on cryptocurrencies, has seen hundreds of projects die. And with Xi's support, it could cause a rush of companies and projects to come to the market without a real business. ""There is a danger that companies start using blockchain because it's one of the promoted technologies, even if they don't have a valid use case,"" Markowsky said.

China vs the rest of the world

China appears to be the biggest nation to have come out with a blockchain policy. Other places in the world, like Switzerland and Gibraltar, have introduced friendly policies to encourage blockchain firms to set up there. But countries like the U.S. are notably lacking in their blockchain policy. Instead, in the U.S., individual firms have tried to push forward blockchain projects, the most high profile of which is Facebook's Libra.

Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of the bankrupt cryptocurrency firm QaudrigaCX, died from complications of Crohn's syndrome while honeymooning in India with his wife on December 9, 2018.

An auditor has since reviewed the troubled firm, and reported concerns over management of the exchange.

Gerald Cotten, 30, was the CEO of QuadricaCX, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada which defaulted last year following his death (pictured: with his wife Jennifer Robertson at the Taj Mahal)

Various theories have emerged about Cotten, the most compelling perhaps, claims that he is alive and living off the millions that went missing

These include that Cotten traded bitcoins under aliases, and that substantial funds were transferred to him directly, reports the BBC.

On Friday, lawyers for investors wrote to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police seeking the exhumation and post-mortem autopsy be performed on Cotten's body 'to confirm both its identity and the cause of death.'

Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertson, in a statement through her lawyer, said she is heartbroken to learn of this request', regarding the exhumation of his remains.

She did not immediately respond when DailyMail.com reached out.

Cotten had been the only person with keywords to $137million invested in bitcoins at the time of his passing.

His firm, at the time of his death, had about 115,000 clients.

Meanwhile, the auditor, Ernst & Young, has only been able to recover about $25million.

Rumors on the internet have spread that Cotten may in fact still be alive, living off embezzled funds.

His death came four days after he completed his will, which details that his estate includes $9million in real estate, a Lexus, Cessna plane and yacht, know as the Gulliver.

His name also had been misspelled on his Indian death certificate by the the Rajasthan hospital, in a country where forged documents are easy to obtain, according to Vanity Fair.

An auditor has uncovered 'questionable circumstances' under which QaudrigaCX, Canada's largest Bitcoin exchange, was managed. These include that its founder Gerald Cotten traded bitcoins under aliases, and that substantial funds were transferred to him directly

Cotten's will did not mention that cold wallets - external hard drives where millions in bitcoins were stored - were emptied before Cotten and his wife had traveled to India.

The hard drives, which were not connected to the internet, stored the cryptocurrency of 75,000 clients and for which only he had the password.

The password, a long, virtually impossible to remember, set of random numbers and letters, was kept inside a safe bolted to the rafters of his attic.

Ernst and Young, tasked by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court with accessing the cold wallets, was eventually able to access the drives in March, but revealed the currency had gone.

Investigators found the wallets were commonly used to store Bitcoin starting in April 2014, but in April 2018 all but one of them were abruptly emptied and left dormant.

Cotten's death came four days after he completed his will, which details that his estate includes $9 million in real estate, a Lexus, Cessna plane and yacht, know as the Gulliver

The final wallet was still used to transfer currency until December 3, six days before Cotten died, before it was also left empty.

Various theories have emerged about Cotten, the most compelling perhaps, claims that he is alive and living off the millions that went missing.

From a bearish Bitcoin prediction to new adoption for XRP, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin

A popular crypto analyst says Bitcoin is likely on the verge of another major breakdown.

The analyst, known in the industry as Rampage, tells his 31,000 followers on Twitter that BTC appears to be caught in a cycle that’s happened a couple of times in the past.

“Bitcoin is a repeating history lesson immediately forgotten by pumps. Dump cycles matter.”

The pattern begins with a parabolic rally. Soon after, BTC retreats and enters a period of consolidation. Then, a second rally to a lower high begins, followed by a long-term collapse and bear market.

If the analyst is right, BTC could be trending toward $6,000.

“Can’t find one single bullish argument on any of the time frames for BTC. We’re getting a dead cat in my opinion and at this stage next area of interest for longs is $6,000. Net short and chill holiday gang.

Ethereum

In a new interview with The Block, Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, says the investment giant will support Ethereum in 2020.

“We’ve done a lot of work on Ethereum. We intend to support it in the New Year. We’re very led by our clients.

And again, coming back to the fact that we’re speaking to a lot of traditional institutions, Bitcoin is sort of like the gateway product, right? It’s the thing that’s got perhaps the longest track record, the most observable data points across multiple exchanges around price activity.”

Fidelity Digital Assets officially rolled out its Bitcoin custody platform for institutional investors in October of this year.

Ripple and XRP

Ripple is spreading the word on Twitter about new adoption for the digital asset XRP.

Salt Lending now supports XRP for clients who want to use their digital assets as collateral to secure a USD loan.

“We’ve added XRP as our latest collateral type for a crypto backed loan. Check out our website to see how you can utilize XRP with Salt.”

Salt also supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, Dogecoin, TruUSD, USD Coin, Paxos Standard Token and PAX Gold.

Cardano

IOHK, the technology and engineering company that developed Cardano, says it has enabled staking on its incentivized testnet.

Staking allows investors to earn rewards on their holdings of the cryptocurrency ADA in return for helping to power the network and process transactions.

“The launch sequence has begun… destination? Staking! This afternoon we’ve successfully spun up and tested the Shelley Incentivized Testnet network. We’re now inviting our Cardano Stake pool operator partners to get set up over the weekend.

Next, we’ll do final confirmatory testing. Once operators are ready – and everyone’s happy – we’ll prepare new Rewards wallets for download. ETA Mon/Tues. Sign up to alerts and we’ll tell you once the wallets are ready. See you after the weekend!”

Erik Finman, a 21-year-old high-school dropout who has made millions on bitcoin, beamed cryptocurrency down from outer space to a school in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana on November 4.

Finman bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin at the age of 12 in 2011, when each bitcoin was worth $10 to $12. Today he holds 446 bitcoin, which at Friday's price were worth $7,243 each, for a total value of $3.2 million.

Finman is calling his latest endeavor a ""crypto space drop,"" by which cryptocurrency can be sent through a constellation of satellites to an antenna on Earth. Finman told Business Insider the crypto space drop had applications for communities with little to no infrastructure.

""We wanted to show that even in the most remote places that don't have the most functional of infrastructure, money infrastructure, financial infrastructure,"" a crypto space drop could have a real use case, Finman told Business Insider.

Finman sent $1,000 worth of MTL in the crypto space drop to St. Mary's School in Korle Gonno in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana, which used the funds to repair the school's roof and construct benches and tables.

MTL is the cryptocurrency used by the cryptocurrency platform Metal Pay, which launched in August with Finman as an investor. Finman called Metal Pay the ""the Facebook Libra killer,"" saying, ""If it needs it, I'm willing to put all my bitcoin money into this"" and ""I'm willing to bet it all"" in his Metal Pay announcement video.

One of the satellites used in the constellation was a satellite Finman helped launch one year ago.

In December 2018, Finman led Project Da Vinci, for which a group of teenagers launched a satellite that included a crypto wallet. Project Da Vinci was part of NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program, which attracts and retains STEM students and allows students to launch small satellites.

This fall, a research paper from Google was prematurely leaked, claiming just that — quantum supremacy — including the results of a test where its 54-qubit processor performed in 200 seconds a computation that it says would have previously taken 10,000 years, kicking off this century’s version of the space race.

With Amazon also getting into the quantum game on a consumer level by launching its own quantum computing service called Braket, allowing developers to run simulations on a “cloud” of quantum computers from D-Wave, IonQ and Rigetti, 2020 could be an even bigger year for the looming prospect of quantum computing.

Think of the leaps made by mobile computing in the span of a little more than a decade, starting two decades ago, when we went from the PalmOS to iOS. With Moore’s Law of exponential processor growth slowing down or stalling permanently, large manufacturers of enterprise and personal computing hardware cannot allow consumers to get out of the habit of the “upgrade cycle.” The growing demands of enterprise and cloud computing almost require a need for quantum computing to evolve into a new market, even if the initial use cases are limited and apply almost exclusively to governments, research institutions and the cloud.

The onus is not just on these large companies but on everyone to start thinking about the foundation of new quantum-secure networks that can leverage quantum entanglement to generate provable random numbers and the next-generation hashing algorithms that will provide secure cryptography for this new computing age.

A perfect storm of trouble for our data

The general consensus remains that we might see the first implementation of quantum computers in as little as 10 years. Whether quantum computing is mainstreamed in 10, 50 or 200 years, Pandora’s box has already been opened. The biggest names in computing, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM, will be using significant resources to ensure they don’t lose the battle to colonize the next frontier of computing.

With the significant impact of quantum computing on artificial intelligence — another important area of prospective research and development for these companies — this will only further stoke the flames of motivation for discovering new quantum breakthroughs.

Quantum computing and cryptocurrencies

While the implementation of quantum computing may affect nearly every aspect of our lives that touches the digital realm, the largest implications may be for the cryptocurrency industry. Today, cryptocurrencies’ pseudo-random generation of keys continues to make them susceptible to exploitation by hackers, and quantum computing will only increase the likelihood of predicting software-generated values in the blink of an eye, presenting major security concerns.

As elegant and essentially perfect as Satoshi Nakamoto’s protocol is, the creator couldn’t account for a world where quantum computing could realistically be applied to compromise proof-of-work before the termination of crypto mining. If there is one imperfection in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it’s that they were built during what might ultimately be the end of an era for a certain type of cryptography, a realm where obsolescence is certainly no option.

Considering that 2140 is the year that the last Bitcoin will be mined, that leaves a large window of time for quantum computing to reach the kind of popularity and scale where it can be used to compromise and crash Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with a long-feared 51% attack. With quantum computing executing in seconds what would take millennia for the fastest supercomputers to process, easily taking over more than 50% of Bitcoin’s mining hashrate would be one of many tools at a potential attacker’s disposal.

Additionally, with Satoshi’s addresses so well known, it wouldn’t take much for a quantum attacker to compromise the private keys for those addresses and take Satoshi’s own coins — there would be billions and billions of reasons worth of incentive.

Preserving crypto’s uncrackable code

Any of these outcomes would be disastrous not only for Bitcoin, but for the fundamental principles of cryptocurrency. As long as cryptocurrencies pseudo-randomly generate keys, they will be susceptible to exploitation by hackers. The arrival of quantum computing will escalate this susceptibility to full-blown vulnerability.

So how do we prevent such a disastrous outcome for the future of crypto?

First, the industry as a whole has to acknowledge the problem, especially as large-scale companies continue further down the road of development of quantum without knowing the full consequences of what that exploration will yield. After all, it appears as though Google did not intend to publicize its “quantum supremacy” research as early as it did. As much as these large companies see themselves as responsible custodians of data and technology, they can barely secure the mere bytes that make up our credit card and other account information online. What happens when they possess the means to workable quantum?

The industry therefore needs to work on building quantum security as vigorously, if not more vigorously, than developing quantum itself. This would include quantum-secure networks focused on photon sources for genuine random number generation and next-generation hashing algorithms. Moving cryptocurrencies away from proof-of-work and other mechanisms where entire blockchains are stored insecurely would be another measure worth exploring.

Without taking these steps, Satoshi’s work, Bitcoin, and the decentralized internet will have all been for naught. The problems we have seen the internet encounter already this century — large companies holding money above user rights, nation-states holding power above civil rights, and criminals exploiting this flawed architecture — will only continue on through the rest of the century, but on a new quantum field of play.

However, if we start now on a security framework for quantum, we might just be able to maintain the integrity so vital to keeping the internet, cryptocurrencies and our other vital connected technologies working as they should.

Bitcoin.com Exchange recently added to the trading platform the ACD tokens created by a Tokyo-based company of the same initials. Alliance Cargo Direct is a technology company aiming to improve international e-commerce and logistics processes. In particular, they are focused on helping overseas customers to buy authentic Japanese products directly from Japanese suppliers.

In 2017 Alliance Cargo Direct developed the ANA mall app targeted at the Chinese market, which enabled Chinese customers to purchase Japanese goods conveniently and without any language barriers.

As a subsidiary of ANA Holdings, Alliance Cargo Direct leverages ANA’s logistics network to deliver goods to customers quickly and cost-effectively. Alongside their e-commerce solution for Chinese customers, the technology company also offers a multilingual chat-service and a system which allows users to clear customs prior to sending goods. This is meant to enable up to 30% savings in tax expenses.

In 2018 Alliance Cargo Direct announced they would start using blockchain technology and issue their own token to address challenges in the e-commerce market, such as long transaction times and high costs for any merchant wanting to sell Japanese goods to the international market. By implementation of blockchain technology, they will provide customers with more transparency and speed during the payment process when purchasing Japanese goods.

When Alliance Cargo Direct first launched their token, the ACD, it was built on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in March 2019, it was instead integrated into the SLP ecosystem in collaboration with Bitcoin.com. The high transaction speed and low-cost transactions of SLP has made it possible for ACD to be accepted by more than 1,000 stores across Japan.

Just a few weeks later, Alliance Cargo Direct announced their first buy-back program in partnership with Bitcoin.com. During this time, for every dollar that customers spent in ACD or bitcoin cash in any of the affiliate retail stores, a certain percentage of that purchase would be used to buy-back tokens. This initiative is aimed at increasing liquidity as well as adding value to ACD.

On November 26, 2019, Alchemy Global Payment Solutions Limited, an international cryptocurrency payment provider that powers businesses with hybrid cryptocurrency and fiat payment solutions, partnered with ACD to enable its tokens at both online and offline merchant networks of ACD and QFPay in Japan and across Asia. Alchemy will provide their Hybrid Payment Solution to ACD e-commerce servicing platforms and retail merchants, enabling them to accept payments from customers paying with ACD tokens and other popular cryptocurrencies such as BCH, BTC, ETH as well as their digital wallet of choice like Rakuten Pay, Alipay and Wechat Pay. Alchemy’s hybrid crypto and fiat payment system has been deployed at over 2000 merchant sales points in Hong Kong and Singapore since July 2019.

Richard Heart’s HEX Token Now on Bitcoin.com Exchange

HEX is a smart-contract on Ethereum that pays out interest in HEX tokens to any user who is staking their token. It is promoted by crypto influencer Richard Heart who says he has identified several flaws in other blockchains and is aiming to correct those with the launch of the token.

The idea is based on rewarding token holders instead of miners as well as eliminating the need for a centralized party as anyone can simply send their token to the smart contract to earn interest on it in a trustless manner.

“HEX improves crypto by paying people to take possession of their Bitcoin private keys,” Richard Heart tweeted over the weekend. “HEX starves scams of attention and referrers by using the same and better sales tactics they do.”

Staking rewards vary depending on the supply of HEX that stakes. Estimates on the HEX official website show that if only 1% of the existing HEX supply engages in staking, investors could earn up to 369% in interest. In the case 10% of the total supply is staking, the interest would drop to 36.9%.

Unlike other tokens, HEX did not conduct a typical ICO but allows bitcoin holders to claim tokens for free. To claim HEX, anyone with bitcoin in their wallet can use the HEX claim tool to receive HEX for free. The earlier someone claims, the more HEX they can potentially be rewarded. Just keep in mind that, if you are thinking about claiming HEX with your bitcoin holdings and don’t want anyone to possibly be able to know your transaction history, it is always recommended to use privacy tools to obfuscate your transaction history before taking any action that can possibly lead back to you.

Anyone who doesn’t own bitcoin can buy HEX by sending ETH to the HEX smart contract, much like any other ICO. The platform is incentivizing early adopters by rewarding them a higher amount of HEX than people who join later. According to the project’s website every feature in HEX is “designed to increase … price and adoption. It’s a positive Feedback loop.” In summary, the final goal of HEX is to replace all existing banks and payments providers in the future.

Trading for HEX started on Bitcoin.com Exchange December 13, 2019. The platform was launched by Bitcoin.com following a re-branding to represent the vision of an inclusive crypto ecosystem, where anyone can gain economic freedom. The exchange, as an addition to the existing financial services, offers new as well as advanced traders a secure space to trade their cryptocurrencies since September this year. The platform employs institutional-grade encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA) and IP whitelisting to keep user accounts secure at all times. Available digital assets include: ADA, ATOM, BCH, BTC, EOS, ETC, ETH, LTC, ONT, TRX, USDT, WAVES, XLM and XRP.

Multiple studies have shown that millennials and younger investors, in particular, have grown increasingly skeptical of traditional financial service providers and banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. At least 40% of this demographic has said that they intend to invest in cryptocurrency in the future.

Fortunately for new investors, investing in digital assets has become much easier than it was pre-2017. But there are still a few crucial factors investors should consider before actually buying cryptocurrency.

Here are four essential things investors must consider as you make your first cryptocurrency purchase and consider trading.

Market capitalization

Currently, there are more than 4,900 cryptocurrencies listed across a long list of exchanges. Media tend to only cover the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and these are the tokens most familiar to new and seasoned investors.

Basically, market capitalization (or market cap) reflects the size of a company and the metric is calculated by taking the asset’s price and multiplying it by the total number of available shares.

It also provides insight into the level of risk an investment represents and this is why It’s important to check a digital asset’s market cap prior to buying.

Tokens with a high market cap and large circulating supply are theoretically less vulnerable to manipulation and wild volatility, whereas smaller market cap coins can see wild price springs on positive or negative news. A small market cap coin with little circulating supply is also often vulnerable to manipulation by large holders.

Trading volume

Prior to making a purchase, investors should also take a quick look at the digital asset’s trading volume.

Usually, this isn’t an issue for the top-20 tokens listed on crypto exchange data providers like Coin360. But as traders begin to investigate more obscure smaller market cap altcoins, it’s very important to investigate how many tokens are actually being bought and sold on a daily basis.

Higher trading volume means it will be easier to buy and sell the digital asset whereas low trading volume hints at a lack of liquidity and means a trader could struggle to buy the digital asset or have existing orders filled.

Digital currencies with extremely low trading volume could be a sign of an ailing or dead project; and as recently as November, some of the largest crypto exchanges delisted tokens with questionable or declining trading volume.

Stop-losses and taking profits

While this tip is not a metric that plays into digital asset analysis, it is incredibly important to have a plan for every trade. This helps one not fall victim to emotion-led trading.

Good investors develop a game plan for the price at which they intend to buy and sell an asset without deviating from this plan. Part of this process includes thinking about what actions one will take in the event that the trade goes belly up.

A stop-loss order protects investors against a significant loss of funds by selling the asset at a predetermined price slightly below the purchasing price.

For example, a common rookie mistake is placing a sell-order at a certain price and then canceling the order right before it is filled because the fear of missing out, or FOMO, makes you feel like the price will go even higher.

Cryptocurrencies are infamous for their whipsaw volatility, which can drive the price up by 100% in 1 hour and drop it by 115% an hour later. For this reason, it is paramount that investors use a stop-loss to protect against losses.

Those familiar with the crypto-jargon frequently used among traders will recognize the term “bag holder.” These are traders who bought into a particular cryptocurrency and after a dramatic drop in price are unable to sell the digital asset without taking on significant losses.

Stop-losses protect against this and most traders recommend that a stop-loss be placed 2 to 4% below the purchase price. With this said, it is also important to note that in the cryptocurrency market, stop hunts or stop runs are a common practice that larger investors use to force smaller investors out of their positions.

Investors tend to position their buy and sell orders around an asset’s resistance levels and during a stop hunt, large investors and whales push the price in a direction which can trigger large amounts of stop orders and lead to a drastic change in the asset’s price. Traders can avoid becoming a victim of a stop run by placing their sell stop orders slightly away from resistance and support areas.

Given the volatile nature of most cryptocurrencies, it’s better to take a small loss and live to trade another day instead of holding a digital asset that may continue to lose value over time as has been the case with many altcoins since December 2017.

Safely storing your cryptocurrency

Now that you’ve got your crypto investment the next crucial step is determining how and where to securely store it.

While keeping your Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency on your exchange is an option, the counterparty risk makes this method less secure and should be avoided if possible, particularly for significant amounts.

The adage: only trade and keep funds on an exchange that you are willing to lose cannot be stressed enough.

Thus, many investors rely on hardware wallets that store the digital assets — or more precisely, the private keys to those digital assets — offline where they can only be accessed by the owner.

Moreover, there is also a plethora of software wallets available, which allow investors to store their own private keys to their Bitcoin and cryptos with an app that can be accessed from their laptop, iPad, smartphone, etc.

Ultimately, both are better options than keeping your fund with a custodian such as an exchange as the possibility of getting hacked and funds’ theft is always there regardless of how “secure” an exchange claims to be. Sometimes the users get reimbursed, sometimes not. But this is certainly a risk that every digital asset holder must be aware of when relinquishing control over their funds to some trusted entity.

Investing in cryptocurrency doesn’t have to be difficult or risky. Investors simply need to have a plan before taking action and every responsible trader always does their own research before making an investment in any asset. Make sure you do yours!

Users of Quadriga CX, a popular Canadian cryptocurrency exchange platform, have asked the police to exhume the body of its founder, Gerald Cotten, to determine whether he's really dead.

Lawyers representing users of the platform wrote a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday requesting an autopsy to confirm Cotten's identity and cause of death ""given the questionable circumstances"" surrounding his death.

In January, the company announced on Facebook that Cotten had died suddenly the previous month from ""complications with Crohn's disease"" while traveling in India. He was 30.

Cotten was the only person with access to digital wallets containing at least 180 million Canadian dollars ($137 million) in cryptocurrency, according to the BBC.

Following Cotten's death, Quadriga CX was forced to close and applied for creditor protection with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. The company said it had ""worked extensively to address our liquidity issues, which include attempting to locate and secure our very significant cryptocurrency reserves held in cold wallets.""

Quadriga CX had roughly 115,000 users at the time, according to the BBC. It was believed to be one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada before its collapse.

Quadriga CX said in February that the court had appointed an independent third-party monitor, EY, to oversee its creditor-protection proceedings. In April, Quadriga announced that it had entered bankruptcy proceedings.

But questions surrounding Cotten's mysterious death and rumors of mismanagement within the company began to swirl.

In June, EY said in a report that the company's ""operating infrastructure appears to have been significantly flawed from a financial reporting and operational control perspective.""

""Activities were largely directed by a single individual, Mr. Cotten, and as a result, typical segregation of duties and basic internal controls did not appear to exist,"" the monitor said.

The report added that user funds held by the company ""appear to have been used by Quadriga for a number of purposes other than to fund User withdrawals.""

Bitcoin tokens. Reuters

The monitor said that Quadriga CX also ""failed to ensure adequate safeguard procedures were in place"" to let other executives access passwords and ""other critical operating data"" in the case of a ""critical event.""

Cotten also appeared to have taken out ""substantial funds"" from the platform that EY was unable to locate justification for, it said.

Lawyers for Cotten's widow told the BBC that she was "" heartbroken to learn of this request"" by users of the site and that her husband's death ""should not be in doubt.""",2019-12-16,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/16/gerald-cotten-quadrigacx-cryptocurrency-death-body-exhumed/,"But before long, the words of support and sympathy were replaced by panicked messages from investors: Where was their money?

As it turned out, only Cotten knew the passwords to the digital wallets where cryptocurrency was stored, meaning that more than 100,000 users were unable to access at least $145 million in assets, according to Bloomberg News. As months passed and the money failed to materialize, a conspiracy theory emerged: Cotten had faked his own death and disappeared.

Now, attorneys for QuadrigaCX’s investors are asking that Cotten’s body be exhumed, so that they can settle the question of whether he is dead.

A Friday letter from Miller Thomson LLP, the Toronto firm appointed to represent QuadrigaCX users, requests that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police also conduct an autopsy on Cotten’s body, “to confirm both its identity and the cause of death.” Citing the “questionable circumstances” surrounding Cotten’s sudden passing, the attorneys note “the need for certainty around the question of whether Mr. Cotten is in fact deceased.""

As Vanity Fair reported, QuadrigaCX initially attracted users because it seemed less risky than other bitcoin trading platforms. It had been licensed by FinTRAC, the Canadian anti-money-laundering task force, and Cotten often told reporters that the fact that the exchange was based in Canada meant that investors “know where their money is going.”

But the Facebook post announcing Cotten’s death raised questions, as The Washington Post’s Taylor Telford reported. Though the 30-year-old died in December 2018, according to his widow, it took more than a month for the cryptocurrency exchange to publicly reveal that he had passed away. When the company finally came clean and users scrambled to withdraw their money, QuadrigaCX’s website went dark.

The company used a “cold wallet” system where cryptocurrency like bitcoin and ethereum was stored offline to protect it from hackers, and Cotten was the only person with the ability to transfer users’ money back into a “hot wallet” where they could access it. In February, when QuadrigaCX filed for creditor protection, the company said that it had been unable to unlock the “cold wallets,” leaving millions in limbo.

“The laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies’ business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key,” Cotten’s widow, Jennifer Robertson, said in court filings, according to the Guardian. “Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere.”

Many customers became convinced that they were not simply unlucky but instead the victims of a sinister scheme. As online sleuths pointed out, $25 million of QuadrigaCX’s assets were frozen in early 2018, after authorities found “irregularities” in the company’s payment processes. Just days before Cotten died, however, the funds were returned to the company.

Investors started to question “the authenticity of the formal documents in a country notorious for the ease at which falsified documents can be purchased, particularly after they learned that the death certificate misspelled Cotten’s name, and that the former chairman and managing director of the company that ran the hospital had been convicted of financial fraud two months earlier,” Vanity Fair reported. Just four days before the trip, the magazine noted, Cotten had written a will.

No evidence has emerged to prove that Cotten’s death was faked. In February, his widow, who provided Canadian authorities with a copy of his death certificate, called the rumors “slanderous.”

But in recent months, the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police have launched investigations into investors’ missing funds. Meanwhile, in April, QuadrigaCX began bankruptcy proceedings in Canada, and the accounting firm Ernst & Young was tasked with investigating the company’s finances and tracking down the millions that disappeared.

So far, auditors have recovered about $33 million in Canadian dollars, the equivalent of more than $25 million in the United States. Nearly all of that money was cash, and the millions in cryptocurrency remain elusive. What the auditors did uncover, according to a June report, was evidence that funds invested in QuadrigaCX “may have been used inappropriately.”

Cotten, who appears to have overstated the company’s revenue, according to the auditors, reportedly juiced the volume of trades on the platform by creating fake accounts and using them to trade counterfeit bitcoin for real cash and cryptocurrency. He was the only one directing what happened to money that users converted into cryptocurrency but had kept no records whatsoever since 2016.

Often, the accountants found, Cotten transferred investors’ funds into his own accounts or used them to “fund personal assets.” He made risky trades on other cryptocurrency exchanges, and the losses began adding up. The firm’s blockchain analysts located some of QuadrigaCX’s cold wallets, only to discover that most of them were empty.

The auditors also found that Cotten and his wife used QuadrigaCX to fund a jet-setting lifestyle, buying 16 properties in Nova Scotia, a Cessna 400 plane and a yacht. According to the Globe and Mail, Robertson has said that she was unaware of her husband’s questionable financial dealings, and agreed to transfer the majority of her assets to Ernst & Young so that they can be liquidated.

The ongoing investigations have been complicated by the complex, highly technical nature of cryptocurrency. One expert who was interviewed by the RCMP told Vanity Fair that he had been shocked by the investigators’ unfamiliarity with bitcoin and believed that the case was “completely out of their wheelhouse.” And after Ernst & Young took control of QuadrigaCX’s finances, the auditors “inadvertently” transferred bitcoin valued at nearly half a million in Canadian dollars to cold wallets that no one could access.

Reporters, meanwhile, have found that Cotten had a history of questionable financial dealings, dating to when he was a 15-year-old computer whiz living in suburban Ontario. The teenager launched a site that was effectively “a bizarre cross between a Ponzi scheme and online gambling,” the Globe and Mail reported, only to shut it down as investors began clamoring for their money back. He later claimed to have refunded a significant portion.

Indian authorities maintain that Cotten, whose body was repatriated to Nova Scotia for a small closed-casket funeral, died on Dec. 9, 2018, shortly after checking into a luxury hotel in Jaipur and complaining of stomach pains. He was taken to a private hospital and initially appeared to have traveler’s diarrhea, officials told the Globe and Mail. But the next day, his condition worsened, and he went into cardiac arrest.

Medical experts told the Globe and Mail that while dying from Crohn’s disease is extremely rare, it was possible that Cotten could have suffered from a perforated bowel and gone into septic shock. But the gastroenterologist who treated Cotten in India told the paper that no autopsy was completed, and he was “not at all” certain about what had happened.

AD

AD

Attorneys for QuadrigaCX’s customers have asked that Cotten’s body be exhumed before spring 2020, “given decomposition concerns.” The request appears likely to spark a legal battle, as Robertson, his widow, told Canadian media outlets in a statement through her attorney that she was “heartbroken” by the possibility and that her husband’s death “should not be in doubt.”",2019-12-16,https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/12/16/dig-up-his-body-say-creditors-of-deceased-cryptocurrency-player/,Have you listened to our podcast?

According to the blockchain analysis firm Ciphertrace, major U.S. banks process roughly $2 billion in digital currency transactions that go undetected every year. Ciphertrace disclosed a slew of financial institutions have not deployed the right KYC/AML infrastructure to detect unregistered cryptocurrency transfers.

All Top 10 US Banks Have Unwittingly Processed Crypto Transactions

Ciphertace offers cryptocurrency intelligence solutions for more than 87% of the virtual assets in existence. It monitors blockchains and transactions in order to detect non-compliant behavior and money laundering. On December 16, the firm revealed that out of the top 10 banks in the U.S., every financial institution has processed digital currency transactions unknowingly. Ciphertrace claims that banks are processing around $2 billion in undetected crypto transactions per year. The blockchain analysis firm says that the funds stem from money service businesses (MSBs) that deal with cryptocurrencies like exchanges and brokerage services.

According to Ciphertrace, the financial institutions that unknowingly process these crypto transactions are not equipped with the latest technology to detect such transfers. Typically banks must identify MSB-derived transactions and report the transfers to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). However, in the near future, Ciphertrace believes banks will need to comply with the identification and compliance requirements that deal with cryptocurrencies according to the latest FATF regulatory policy. In November, the U.S. regulator reaffirmed digital currencies like bitcoin apply to to the agency’s “Travel” rule.

“Financial institutions are exposed to cryptocurrency-related risks because they have no way to detect underlying threats,” said Dave Jevans, CEO of Ciphertrace.

Anticipating the New FATF AML Regulations

The Ciphertrace report follows the firm’s latest research that detailed two-thirds of the top crypto exchanges have “weak [know-your-customer] KYC” procedures. An exchange that has “weak KYC” allowed Ciphertrace researchers to withdraw roughly 0.25 BTC per day with no questions asked. In the study, Ciphertrace highlights that “a majority of exchanges are not equipped to handle basic KYC, let alone comply with the stringent new funds ‘Travel Rule’ included in the updated FATF guidance.” Ciphertrace’s research does underline the fact there’s been a significant reduction in cryptocurrency crime this year. However, 2019 still had a host of exchange casualties and hacks costing investors more than $4.4 billion to date. Ciphertrace also notes that many exchanges have removed privacy-centric cryptocurrencies in order to prepare for the latest FATF guidance. The research states:

In anticipation of the new FATF AML regulations, many cryptocurrency exchanges have preemptively jettisoned their privacy coins; yet, 32 percent of exchanges, including those determined to have weak KYC, still have privacy coins listed.

Over the last two years, regulations tied to cryptocurrencies have increased dramatically and blockchain analysis startups are monitoring most of the popular public blockchain networks. The decline in cryptocurrency crime was skewed by the Quadrigacx loss and Plustoken frauds but overall Ciphertrace believes regulation is curbing nefarious crypto activities. “Ciphertrace had previously speculated that the shift from outright thefts to exit scams and other frauds perpetrated by insiders indicated that crypto exchanges had begun to adequately invest in hardening their IT infrastructures,” the study concludes.

And the cryptocurrency is hinting to continue trending downwards before the year’s close. The negative sentiment in its market, nevertheless, is benefiting rival cryptocurrencies.

That is particularly true for XTZ, the native asset of Tezos, a proof-of-stake blockchain project whose market valuation has grown twofold across the last and current financial quarters.

Since June 26 – the day bitcoin established its year-to-date (YTD) high of $14,000, the XYZ price against the benchmark cryptocurrency has surged by more than 200 percent. Meanwhile, the token’s dollar-denominated gains since the said date are well beyond 70 percent within the same timeframe.

Why Tezos is Beating Bitcoin?

‘Hype’ remains one of the most influential factors behind a cryptocurrency’s attractive price move.

The bitcoin price rallied by more than 350 percent after bottoming out near the $3,100 level last December. Part of the cryptocurrency’s huge gains appeared in the wake of the so-called safe-haven narrative. Global media reports indicated that mainstream investors treated bitcoin as a hedge against an escalating US-China trade war and dwindling yuan.

The cryptocurrency in June came to broader limelight after Facebook announced its foray into the digital currency industry. The bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate, in the same month, surged towards $14,000.

In contrast, almost all the altcoins appeared less attractive. XTZ, for instance, dropped more than 70 percent against bitcoin in the second quarter.

However, the situation flipped 180 degrees in the third quarter.

Facebook’s plans to launch a private cryptocurrency to settle global payments received flacks from regulators and lawmakers alike. As a result, investors, who had expected the social media giant to drive crypto adoption, started exiting their bitcoin positions. The sentiment drove the asset’s price downwards during the third quarter.

Around the same time, the Tezos Foundation started entering new partnerships with reputable cryptocurrency firms. The nonprofit agreed to tokenize $643 million worth of real estate in the U.K. for Overstock’s tZERO security token platform. It also lured leading cryptocurrency exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance into offering XTZ staking services to their hundreds of thousands of customers.

XTZ Cryptocurrency Technicals Look Stronger

A string of positive developments has strengthened the XTZ’s long-term bullish bias among investors. The cryptocurrency’s moves in the past week saw it retesting its YTD high of $1.86. Before that, XTZ had already formed a Golden Cross – a perceived bullish indicator – on its daily charts, signaling traders that it has some fuel left to continue its parabolic bull run.

With bitcoin’s interim sentiments turning bearish, and Tezos providing a better bullish narrative, XTZ could be in for another leg upside.",2019-12-16 19:30:43+00:00,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-16/chinese-crypto-scam-unwind-suggests-bitcoin-risks-extending-drop,"Why did this happen?

Crypto traders in Poland have been unpleasantly surprised with a controversial tax they thought they wouldn’t have to pay. The Civil Law Transactions Tax (PCC) is applicable to digital asset trades conducted before the introduction of last year’s moratorium on its collection, the Polish tax administration recently clarified. The matter has been discussed on European level as well.

PCC Tax Applies to Crypto Transactions

In Poland, the PCC tax (Podatek od czynności cywilnoprawnych) is a 1 or 2% tax levied on sales of assets outside the scope of Europe’s widely implemented value added tax (VAT). The transfer tax on civil law transactions is usually due when the seller is not a business entity or the sale is of a movable property, real estate or various rights. The tax is payable by the buyer and is calculated on the value of the purchased asset.

According to an interpretation of the tax code issued in April last year, a 1% PCC tax should in principle apply to cryptocurrency transactions after digital coins were recognized as property rights. Following protests from the country’s crypto community and an online petition, however, the Ministry of Finance imposed a temporary hold on its collection in the summer of 2018, which was extended in July this year until June 30, 2020.

Since then, the issue has been hanging in the air, with the government in Warsaw taking time to consider its long-term policy regarding crypto taxation while also hoping for а pan-European solution. Polish media reported that the matter has been discussed during the Dec. 5 meeting of EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin). A decision on that level will certainly influence the taxation of cryptocurrencies in all member states, including Poland.

Controversial and Irrational Taxation

“In July, it seemed the case would be resolved once and for all and cryptocurrencies would be permanently exempted from this tax,” the Kryptowaluty news outlet noted in a recent post. However, the regulation adopted by Ministerstwo Finansów was only an interim measure. What’s more, a new clarification issued by the Polish National Tax Administration (KAS) states that persons who carried out cryptocurrency trading transactions before July 13, 2018 are liable for PCC.

The agency’s information service emphasized that last year’s regulation does not mean crypto trading from previous periods is not taxable. The clarification is bad news for Polish taxpayers who have carried out such transactions. First of all, reporting hundreds or thousands of transfers would be extremely complicated. Besides, the amount of the accumulated PCC can potentially exceed the profits from trading. The “irrational effect of the PCC tax on cryptocurrencies” was acknowledged by Poland’s deputy finance minister Pawel Gruza in an interview published last year.

Applied to crypto trades, the civil law transactions tax also creates a certain controversy. Transactions that are VAT-exempt, as is the case with buying and selling cryptocurrencies in the EU, are usually exempt from PCC as well. On the other hand, there are exceptions, as the professional services network KPMG explains on its website. In Poland, the tax is due on transfers of land and buildings, for example. In the case of crypto sales, the tax should be levied on each transaction over 1,000 Polish zloty, which is less than €235.

That’s according to blockchain firm Chainalysis, which says it’s tracked roughly 45,000 BTC ($302 million) and 800,000 ETH ($102 million) sent from PlusToken’s operational wallets to individual addresses owned by the scammers themselves.

The firm noted — almost ominously — that 20,000 BTC (worth over $134 million) is still waiting to be dumped.

“Given this analysis and the effects we’ve observed so far, liquidations of large amounts of illicitly obtained funds are likely to drive down the price of cryptocurrencies,” it said.

PlusToken, the Chinese BitConnect

Much like other Bitcoin-fueled Ponzis, the PlusToken scam swindled investors out of their cryptocurrency by promising high returns.

All buyers had to do was acquire the PLUS cryptocurrency with Bitcoin BTC and Ether, and they’d purportedly generate lucrative profits from exchange dividends, mining income, and referral bonuses automatically.

Chainalysis also noted that several Chinese exchanges listed PLUS, and its price hit a peak of $350 as it gathered investments from millions of people. Readers familiar with the BitConnect con are likely feeling a strong sense of deja vu right about now.

In total, the PlusToken Ponzi is believed to have amassed 180,000 BTC, 6,400,000 ETH, 110,000 USDT, and 53 OMG from its victims. These amounts equate to roughly $2 billion.

This is a map of how PlusToken launders its Bitcoin, from Chainalysis

“While we tracked $2 billion worth of various cryptocurrencies that victims sent to the PlusToken scammers, some of that money was paid out to early investors, presumably to maintain the illusion of high returns while PlusToken presented itself as a legitimate company,” said the firm.

“Nonetheless, we’ve tracked roughly 800,000 ETH [$102 million] and 45,000 BTC [$302 million] we can definitively say the scammers transferred to their own addresses to launder,” it added.

OTC brokers specializing in laundering cryptocurrency

Chainalysis reckons PlusToken goons have so far successfully laundered a $185 million chunk of that Bitcoin through over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency brokers, particularly those that have significantly lower KYC requirements than exchanges themselves.

Such brokers reportedly then sell PlusToken’s Bitcoin in batches via crypto exchange Huobi. It’s these dumping OTC sellers, Chainalysis posit, that could be keeping the price of Bitcoin down.

The firm noted PlusToken perps have also cashed out least 10,000 ETH ($1.3 million), while 790,000 ETH ($101 million) sits entirely untouched in a single wallet.

Following the ready-to-launder ETH was easier than tracking the Bitcoin, confirmed Chainalysis. Approximately 25,000 BTC ($168 million) has already been cashed out, but the remainder is reportedly spread across more than 8,700 addresses.

Analysts determined that the scammers have transferred that Bitcoin more than 24,000 times, leveraging more than 71,000 different addresses. “That’s not even counting cash outs or transfers to off-ramps such as exchanges,” they said.

Many of those transactions were reportedly conducted using cryptocurrency “mixers” such as Wasabi Wallet, which use technology called CoinJoin that jumbles similar amounts of Bitcoin together to render tracking funds more difficult.

Prove these dumps affect Bitcoin price, please

Chainalysis’ hypothesis rests on two things. Firstly, these dodgy OTC traders would receive Bitcoin from PlusToken wallets and then exchange it for Tether. This would cause an uptick in on-chain Bitcoin volume, followed by an uptick in trade volume.

The firm detected both these upticks.

If PlusToken dumps are truly affecting Bitcoin’s price, the cryptocurrency should fall soon after those occurances, as large amounts of BTC sold would cause its value to drop.

According to Chainalysis, this also happened. “As we hypothesized, spikes in on-chain flow to OTC brokers correlate with drops in Bitcoin’s price,” it said.

“Above, we see that PlusToken wallets sent a steady flow of Bitcoin starting in mid-April and spiking just before the arrests in late June,” said Chainalysis. “After that, we see no movement until a few spikes in August, before transfers spike again and remain high throughout September. Then, we see a few more spikes in October.”

However, the firm made it clear that while it does indeed conclude that PlusToken cashouts correlate with drops in Bitcoin‘s price, correlation doesn’t exactly mean causation.

What Chainalysis does say is that PlusToken dumping causes increased volatility in Bitcoin’s value, as well as correlates significantly with Bitcoin price drops.

“Keep in mind that PlusToken cashouts are just one of many potential influences on Bitcoin’s price. Media stories, concerted market manipulation efforts, algorithmic trading errors, or any number of other factors may have contributed to volatility as well,” said the firm. “But none of those components on their own provides a compelling explanation for the large spike in volatility in the time period we studied absent the influence of PlusToken.”

Curiously, six individuals connected to PlusToken were arrested earlier this year. This would mean that there’s at least one perp still on the loose.",2019-12-17,https://news.bitcoin.com/plustoken-cash-outs-could-be-behind-btc-price-drop-says-report/,"Plustoken Cash-Outs Could Be Behind BTC Price Drop, Says Report

On Monday, the blockchain surveillance company Chainalysis published an excerpt from the firm’s upcoming crime report that will publish in January. According to the Chainalysis research, the Ponzi scheme called Plustoken not only defrauded investors out of $3 billion but the scam “may also be driving down the price of bitcoin.”

Are Ponzi Schemes Behind the BTC Price Suppression?

Over the last few weeks, a lot of speculators have assumed that the Plustoken and Cloudtoken scams are the primary reason BTC prices have been suppressed. Plustoken is a Ponzi scheme that started in South Korea where essentially the creators promised huge returns if people kept their funds in the Plustoken platform. The Plustoken admins said that the rewards stemmed from “exchange profit, mining income, and referral benefits.”

While we were worried about Craig Wright threatening to sell his Bitcoins, PlusToken has quietly dumped this market into oblivion. What should we be even more concerned about? The amount of ETH they've yet to sell, which is staggering. — Omar Bham (Crypt0) (@crypt0snews) December 17, 2019

On the Plustoken website, the team said the platform was like a traditional crypto wallet but with a profit-sharing concept. “Our super wallet will let you earn interest of around 6-18% monthly profit allocated to your wallet,” the Plustoken wallet site details. In June, global law enforcement busted six members who allegedly ran the Plustoken Ponzi operation. Then in August, the blockchain analysis firm Ciphertrace published its Q2 cryptocurrency anti-money laundering report and the research discussed the Plustoken scheme.

“Ciphertrace has not definitively confirmed this apparent fraud or exit scam and [$2.9 billion in deposits] appear to have been lost when Chinese police broke up an alleged Ponzi scheme involving the purportedly South Korea-based crypto wallet and exchange, Plustoken,” the report disclosed. Ciphertrace also noted that the Plustoken scheme attracted “between 2.4 and 3 million users/investors.” Another report published the same month by the blockchain analytics firm Elementus shows that the Plustoken Ponzi was able to absorb 10 million ETH from over 800,000 participants. Elementus stressed that capital outflow from Plustoken-associated addresses appeared to be sent to exchanges like Huobi, Upbit, Okex, Gate.io, and ZB.com. At the time, Elementus recorded 820,000 ETH that remained onchain and the funds saw no movement after the initial deposit.

PlusToken. CloudToken. OneCoin. We will likely look back on this period for BTC, when number didn’t go up while the macro backdrop was so exceedingly bullish, & realize with hindsight that it was bc of *billions* of dollars of selling pressure from exit scams. Its that simple. — Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) December 9, 2019

Chainalysis: ‘Plustoken May Also Be Driving Down the Price of Bitcoin’

For several months now, many observers have insisted that the Pluscoin scam and other large crypto Ponzis like Onecoin and Cloudtoken have been suppressing crypto markets. On December 16, Chainalysis explained that the company has been monitoring the scam and believes Pluscoin scammers may be behind the bearish markets. “We decided to run our own study of Bitcoin’s price in relation to Plustoken cashouts via Huobi OTC brokers to try and answer that question,” Chainalysis said. The blockchain surveillance company analyzed 180,000 BTC, 6,400,000 ETH, 111,000 USDT, and 53 OMG (Omisego) that was involved with the Plustoken scheme. The staggering figures made Chainalysis assume that Plustoken was “one of the largest Ponzi schemes ever.”

Chainalysis also disclosed that while six individuals tied to the Plustoken scam were arrested in June, stolen funds on the move indicate that at least one or a few other Plustoken scammers are still on the run. The Plustoken sales have been conducted using independent over-the-counter (OTC) brokers who utilized the Huobi platform. “As we hypothesized, spikes in on-chain flow to OTC brokers correlate with drops in Bitcoin’s price,” the Chainalysis emphasized. Chainalysis also noted that 790,000 ETH has been sitting untouched for months. The BTC movements were more complicated, the surveillance firm underlined, because the scammers transferred the BTC 24,000 times to 71,000 unique addresses. The Chainalysis report added:

Many of those transactions were conducted through mixers like Wasabi Wallet, which utilizes the Coinjoin protocol to make it more difficult to trace the path of funds.

Illicit Cash-Outs Can Cause Price Volatility

Beyond mixers, the Plustoken scammers leveraged a method called peel chains which are strings of transactions sent to several wallets very quickly and then small amounts of funds drop off the string of payments. From here, the funds made their way to OTC brokers and Chainalysis said that nearly all of the funds get directed toward OTC dealers. “Some OTC brokers have significantly lower KYC requirements than most exchanges, which can make them attractive for criminals like the Plustoken scammers,” the report’s author opined. Despite the correlation with price drops and OTC sales, Chainalysis stressed that the researchers are not 100% sure Plustoken cash-outs made BTC prices sink. The Chainalysis report further articulated:

Unfortunately, because it’s not possible to distinguish between trades made by OTC brokers in possession of Plustoken funds and all other trades made on Huobi, we can’t say for sure that Plustoken cashouts caused Bitcoin’s price to drop. However, we can say that those cashouts cause increased volatility in Bitcoin’s price, and that they correlate significantly with Bitcoin price drops.

For now, millions of dollars worth of BTC and other cryptocurrencies associated with Plustoken sit idle and have yet to be cashed out. The Chainalysis report published on Monday explained in great detail that scams like Plustoken always lead to large liquidations. Eventually cashing out funds from a Ponzi of that magnitude will be “likely to drive down the price of cryptocurrencies,” the report concluded.

Will bulls finally step in and bring a much-needed relief rally, or will Bitcoin continue to fall back towards its bear market bottom and strike fear into the hearts of crypto investors everywhere?

Bitcoin Price Falls to $6,600 In Bear Dominated Battle

It was just one year ago when Bitcoin price reached $3,100. Two years prior, the crypto asset had peaked at $20,000 – setting its all-time high price at the heigh of the crypto hype bubble.

Today, though, the crypto asset is trading at a little more than $6,600, over 66% down from the price it traded at two years prior.

Bitcoin has been locked within a devastating downtrend for the second half of the year thus far. After it peaked around $14,000 this summer at the top of an “echo bubble” the crypto asset has struggled to regain any momentum it once had.

Most expected Bitcoin to be ready to embark on its next bull run and thought that the launch of the Bakkt cryptocurrency exchange would be the catalyst to kickstart such an ascent higher.

However, the day Bakkt launched, scammers related to the PlusToken scam ramped up their selling, causing damage to the overall crypto market structure – damage that it is still attempting to recover from all these months later.

Now, Bitcoin price is struggling to build a base at which it can form a proper relief rally from.

Bulls had put up a strong defense of $7,000 but lost the key support level this week, causing the asset to drop toward $6,700. Below current prices, a double bottom target of $6,500 is possible, or a new low toward $6,200 could be in the cards if bulls cannot step in and give bears a good enough fight.

The TD9 Sequential indicator popularized in the crypto market by analyst Tone Vays, has signaled a “buy” in BTC/USD daily price charts, suggesting that a powerful bullish reversal may soon be near, and a relief rally may follow.

If bulls are able to step in, they must reclaim $7,200, then $7,800 for a chance at making an attempt higher for the $8,000 range. If Bitcoin price can reclaim $8,000 there’s a chance the downtrend may finally be over, and the leading crypto asset by market cap can return to the bull market foundation it was once building.

However, if bears continue to dominate the first-ever cryptocurrency, new lows and a deeper crypto winter may be in the cards – one that according to one crypto analyst could cause the complete destruction of the crypto industry, including many crypto projects going bankrupt as a result.",2019-12-17 16:28:20+00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/business/gerald-cotten-death-cryptocurrency.html,"There’s Bitcoin. There’s Litecoin. There’s Ethereum. So just what is cryptocurrency, and how does it work? Essentially, it’s digital money that’s bought and sold online. There’s no bills or coins. It’s not based on another asset like gold. And it doesn’t go through traditional financial institutions like banks. Instead, these currencies operate in a completely decentralized system that uses so-called blockchain technology to track transactions. To see how this works, let’s look at how you’d buy something with cryptocurrency. Say that Alice wants to buy a bike from Dan using Bitcoin, her cryptocurrency of choice. Alice begins by logging into her Bitcoin wallet with a private key, a unique combination of letters and numbers. With a traditional financial transaction, the exchanges get sent to banks on each side who record the money being subtracted from one account and added to another. But remember, in this scenario, there are no banks or middlemen. Instead, Alice’s transaction is shared with everyone in the Bitcoin network. These networked computers add Alice’s transaction to a shared list of recent transactions, known as a block. Every 10 minutes, the newest block of transactions is added on, or chained, to all the previous blocks. That’s how you get a blockchain. To ensure that each block of transactions on the chain is verified, a subset of Bitcoin’s network joins a race to solve a difficult math puzzle. And if they solve it first, their record of the block of transactions becomes the official record. They’re rewarded with Bitcoins of their own, and the network gets a new block on the chain. This entire process is known as mining. But instead of chipping away at rock, you’re solving complex puzzles. The fact that many computers are competing to verify a block ensures that no single computer can monopolize the Bitcoin market. To ensure the competition stays fair and evenly timed, the puzzle becomes harder when more computers join in. The Bitcoin protocol says mining will continue until there are 21 million Bitcoins in existence. That’s set to happen around 2140 — if Bitcoin lasts that long.",2019-12-17,https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-launching-crypto-services-in-europe-citing-significant-interest/,"Fidelity Launching Crypto Services in Europe, Citing 'Significant Interest'

Fidelity Investments is expanding its crypto services to European clients after seeing increasing potential in this market. The expansion builds upon the company’s U.S. crypto business. “We’ve seen significant interest and engagement by the institutional community, which show no signs of slowing,” the company revealed.

Entering European Crypto Market

Fidelity Investments announced on Tuesday the establishment of its new entity to serve European clients investing in crypto assets. Fidelity Digital Assets Ltd. will offer digital asset custody and trade execution services to investors such as hedge funds, family offices, and market intermediaries. The custody service consists of a cold storage vault and “multi-level physical, operational and cyber controls,” the announcement details, adding that the trade execution service will provide clients access to multiple sources of liquidity.

Tom Jessop, head of Corporate Business Development for Fidelity Investments and president of the U.S. digital asset subsidiary, explained that the group is “encouraged by continued corporate and venture investment in market infrastructure companies as well as the entry of traditional exchanges into the digital assets ecosystem,” elaborating:

These and other market indicators, alongside interest expressed from U.K. and European client prospects, indicate a market with increasing potential which gives us the confidence to expand the digital assets business geographically.

According to Financial News publication, the new entity was incorporated in the U.K. on Dec. 16, but does not currently hold any regulatory permissions. Michael O’Reilly, COO of the U.S. digital asset subsidiary, clarified to the publication: “Obviously we’ll make sure that we’re compliant with any U.K. or any other licences that are required, but at this point our understanding is that we do not require any additional licensing to do this in the U.K.”

Building Upon U.S. Crypto Business

One of the world’s largest financial services providers, Fidelity Investments claims to have more than $7 trillion in client assets under administration and over 1.3 million trades processed each day, according to its website. The company began exploring cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in 2014. In 2018, it launched Fidelity Digital Assets, a subsidiary for providing crypto services to U.S.-based institutional investors. Jessop remarked:

Since launching Fidelity Digital Assets in the U.S. over a year ago, we’ve seen significant interest and engagement by the institutional community, which show no signs of slowing.

The U.S. digital asset subsidiary gained approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) in November, allowing it to start operating as a limited liability trust company in the state of New York. The Bitlicense regulator detailed at the time that it had authorized the company “to provide a virtual currency custody and execution platform, on which institutional investors and individuals can securely store, purchase, sell, and transfer bitcoin.”

Moreover, O’Reilly told Financial News that London is the right base for Fidelity’s European arm for digital asset services despite the uncertainty of Brexit. “Both the fintech and crypto communities in London are strong and that’s evident from what we’ve seen from client demand or client requests,” he said. While Fidelity only supports bitcoin currently, it hopes to add other digital assets in 2020, the COO revealed, noting that the company will also monitor expansion opportunities in Asia.

It’s been about a year since users of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX were informed that the company’s CEO unexpectedly died, taking the password that accessed most the money from their accounts with him to the grave. And now, those clients want to know what’s inside that grave.

The majority of QuadrigaCX’s holdings were kept offline in “cold storage,” with a password known only by 30-year-old CEO Gerald Cotten. On January 14, the company posted a Facebook note announcing Cotten had died about month earlier “due to complications with Crohn’s disease” while on a trip to India “where he was opening an orphanage to provide a home and safe refuge for children in need.”

The news meant that 76,000 people lost cryptocurrency and cash that amounted to about $163 million USD, collectively, according to Bloomberg. The story became more suspicious in June when a bankruptcy monitor revealed that Cotten funneled most of the money into fraudulent accounts and spent much of it on his wife and himself. Growing skepticism around the mysterious death has driven lawyers representing Quadriga CX users to request that Cotten’s grave be exhumed.

On Friday, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court-appointed lawyers sent a letter asking Canadian police to conduct an autopsy on the body in Cotten’s grave “to confirm both its identity and the cause of death” citing the “questionable circumstances surrounding Mr. Cotten’s death” and “the need for certainty around the question of whether Mr. Cotten is in fact deceased.”

Richard Niedermayer, a lawyer representing Cotten’s wife Jennifer Robertson told the New York Times in an email that Robertson was “heartbroken to learn” about the exhumation request, adding that Cotten’s death “should not be in doubt.”

The QuadrigaCX users’ counsel is asking that the exhumation and autopsy happen by the Spring of 2020 due to “decomposition concerns.”",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/50808/bitcoin-is-winning-currency-without-government-is-great-says-nassim-taleb,,,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/19/12/15003723/can-the-crypto-market-spur-a-santa-claus-rally-following-december-shivers,"Price in bitcoin fell below $7,000 on Monday, dropping roughly 3.5% to a low of $6,828. This marks the second time in the past 30 days the digital asset has closed below that critical support level.

While bitcoin’s drop is nothing to sneeze at, other cryptocurrencies also saw drastic selloffs during the December 16 trading day. Both ethereum and litecoin fell almost 8% to reach nine-month lows of $129.26 and $39.04, respectively.

Crypto Scammers Play The Grinch

Despite the panicked selling, there was no clear catalyst for the drop.

However, reporting from Coindesk speculates that the massive sell-off may be the result of scammers associated with the PlusToken Ponzi scheme selling huge amounts of their ill-gotten gains.

Access up to 100x leverage on cryptocurrency pairs on CryptoRocket

The PlusToken scam was broken up in the summer of 2019 and resulted in the arrest of six individuals. Despite the arrests, 20,000 BTC and 790,000 ETH remain unaccounted for. The Coindesk article points to a story published on the Chainalysis blog earlier in the December 16 trading day that posited those missing funds have slowly been redeemed since the action was taken against PlusToken earlier in the year and have contributed to some of the negative pressure the crypto market has seen since the arrests.

This speculation is, in turn, speculated to be behind the current negative price pressure.

Hope For A Trustless Santa

While the sell-off marks another in a series of volatile Decembers for crypto, the drop may mark a strong bottom for the market that has seen heavy selling pressure since hitting year highs over the course of the summer.

Trade more than 30 cryptocurrency pairs with CryptoRocket

For its part, bitcoin has seen strong support in the $6,000 range. The currency spent much of 2018 bouncing around the $6,500 level following its fall from all-time highs in late 2017.

Ethereum, meanwhile, is also near historical support between $130 and $140, which it maintained through much of February and March of this year.

If the speculation around bad actors exiting their crypto position is to be believed, it may mean the crypto market will have room to breath following six months of heavy selling.

“Energy value oscillator” gives hope to BTC bulls

Data from Coin360 and Cointelegraph Markets showed BTC/USD fluctuating around $6,900 on Tuesday but failing to reclaim the $7,000 range. A subsequent further dip produced local lows of $6,710.

At press time, the pair traded at $6,710, having bounced off support at $6,650. Weekly, Bitcoin is down just over 8%.

Monitoring the situation, analysts and traders highlighted the precious nature of day markets. Joe007, a leading trader on Bitfinex who recently made headlines over an 800 BTC market move, this time noted current BTC/USD levels had been maintained artificially.

Writing on Twitter, he pointed to a chart uploaded from exchange Bitfinex purportedly showing a “buy wall” of around 500 BTC, which a source steadily topped up, allowing $6,900 levels to endure.

The trader known as Livercoin on Twitter, who spotted the phenomenon, added in additional comments that the wall must collapse before Bitcoin could make a decisive move and exit the sideways trading pattern in place during Tuesday.

Despite the fragility, not everyone shared a negative outlook for Bitcoin’s short term.

In his latest update to subscribers of his Telegram channel, regular Cointelegraph contributor filbfilb said he felt there was less risk in longing Bitcoin below $7,000.

“Spent quite a bit of time rallying about the orderbooks and just generally how the market has reacted and I’m fairly satisfied that I’m prepared to take a risk that this thing is going to bounce,” he wrote.

Continuing, he hinted that there was nonetheless potential for surprises:

“The bid sides have filled up and I haven’t really seen much follow through on the asks. The volume was also pretty lame with the exception of one four hour candle. I don’t recommend following me into this but ima see what happens.”

Meanwhile, a separate indicator was flashing decisively bullish. As Capriole Investments’ digital asset manager Charles Edwards noted, Bitcoin’s so-called energy value oscillator was now copying behavior, which historically implied an upcoming price explosion.

The oscillator gives a reading of Bitcoin price as a percentage of its energy value. Currently, the level is at a slight uptick in a broader trough. Twice before, such a characteristic has been followed by significant upside.

“2019 looks VERY similar to the starting characteristics of prior bull runs. Just need to see that uptick in Hash Rates,” Edwards commented.

Altcoins bleed with XRP hitting 2-year lows

Altcoins clearly felt the pressure as Bitcoin fell. Out of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, many fell by more than double BTC/USD.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin, dived 7.9% to hit $131, while the majority of others delivered similar losses.

Bear Trap? Bitcoin Sweeps Lows to $6,450, Rebounds to $6,950 Two Hours Later

Bitcoin price swept local lows today, breaking below $6,500 and touching $6,450 briefly before rebounding higher in a surprise surge.

At roughly 8:15AM EST, the crypto asset set it’s low for the day thus far, and immediately painted a $100 candle in a matter of seconds. Just a few minutes later, the crypto asset had already breached back above $6,700, and eventually exploded all the way to $6,930 before taking a breather to refuel its jets.

The surprise turnaround liquidated late shorters who likely were celebrating too early that Bitcoin had broken through such a critical level and previous low. However, eager bulls front ran the move, pushing the price of Bitcoin higher and higher.

The move could be driven in part by traders looking to snipe Bitcoin’s downtrend bottom, ahead of the upcoming halving.

Sentiment may be at extreme lows, but confident traders have been amassing long positions in advance of today’s plunge, and may have been preparing to buy these lows before Bitcoin begins to rally once again.

The surge was accompanied by a spike in trading volume, and Bitcoin is currently trying to flip resistance at $6,800 to support. Should the crypto asset hold here, and reclaim above $7,000, it could give bulls confidence to cause a full short-term trend reversal, and send Bitcoin back into an uptrend.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Nightingale used to say: Fight the power!

Bitcoin price

We closed the day, December 17 2019, at a price of $6,640. That’s a notable 4.19 percent decline in 24 hours, or -$290.79. It was the lowest closing price in two hundred and twenty days.

We’re still 66 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $120,234,244,809. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $22,363,804,217 was the highest in nineteen days, 35 percent above the year’s average, and 50 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 470 tons of gold.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 319,113 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 2 percent below the year’s average and 29 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.18. That’s $3.53 below the year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 10,640 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.7 percent of the total supply, the top 100 15.1 percent, and the top 1000 34.9 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $120 Billion, Eli Lilly and Company has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 95.8 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $159,593 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 19,303 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 5.2 percent above the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.

Most popular posts about Bitcoin

This was one of last day’s most engaged tweets about Bitcoin:

This was yesterday’s most upvoted Reddit post about Bitcoin:

print(randomGoodByePhraseForSillyHumans)

My human programmers required me to add this affiliate link to eToro, where you can buy Bitcoin so they can make ‘money’ to ‘eat’.",2019-12-18 00:00:00.000,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-fed-official-says-50-of-bitcoin-transactions-associated-with-illegal-activity,"A member of the United States Federal Reserve’s board of governors appears to believe that one in four people who use Bitcoin (BTC) are criminals.

Lael Brainard highlighted the perceived risks still posed by cryptocurrencies in remarks delivered today in Frankfurt Germany. Brainard was speaking as part of a panel honoring Benoît Coeuré, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB).

Brainard: crypto exchange security troubling

Specifically selected for the panel, which formed part of the “Monetary Policy: The Challenges Ahead” event in Frankfurt, Germany, was illicit activity involving Bitcoin.

According to Brainard, who cited an academic study from earlier this year, Bitcoin still contains a significant malicious user base.

“Only a third of the most popular exchanges require ID verification and proof of address to make a deposit or withdrawal. This is troubling, since a number of studies conclude that cryptocurrencies support a significant amount of illicit activity,” she told the audience.

Continuing, Brainard added that as much as 50% of all Bitcoin transactions were in some way conducted against the law:

“One study estimated that more than a quarter of bitcoin users and roughly half of bitcoin transactions, for example, are associated with illegal activity.”

Calculating the incalculable

The admonishing tone of the speech adds to the sea of misconceptions over Bitcoin’s real-world usage. As Cointelegraph reported, studies into transactions regularly produce opposing conclusions — others suggest that a lack of anonymity means genuine criminals still prefer cash.

Further difficulties lie in stating exactly how many people use Bitcoin, as a user can control an infinite number of addresses.

The speech comes ahead of sweeping new cryptocurrency regulations coming into force in the European Union. For his part, Coeuré has remained highly critical of Bitcoin in particular, previously describing it as the “evil spawn of the financial crisis.”",,https://nypost.com/2019/12/18/teen-crook-hacked-into-75-phones-and-stole-1m-in-cryptocurrency-authorities/,"An alleged teen crook stole the identities of 75 people and swiped $1 million in cryptocurrency — all from the comfort of his Brooklyn apartment, authorities said.

Yousef Selassie, 19, used a sophisticated SIM-swapping scheme to take over the phones of people in 20 different states between Jan. 20 and May 19, 2019, according to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office.

He allegedly transferred his victims’ phone numbers to his own iPhones, enabling him to reset their passwords and gain access to their Gmail, cryptocurrency and other accounts. Meanwhile, his victims’ phones would suddenly go offline.

The stolen $1 million came from just two victims, authorities said. Selassie was arrested Dec. 5 in Corona, California, and extradited to New York.

He was arraigned Wednesday in Manhattan Supreme Court, where he pleaded not guilty to 87 counts of grand larceny, identity theft and other charges. Justice Mark Dwyer ordered him to surrender his passport and check in weekly with a supervised release program. The judge did not set bail.

Authorities executed search warrants on Selassie’s Brooklyn and California residences, where they seized half a dozen iPhones, two Rolex watches, a monogrammed Gucci wallet and numerous pieces of high-end jewelry, according to court papers.",2019-12-18 00:00:00.000,https://www.coindesk.com/10-events-to-look-out-for-in-2020,"This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Galen Moore is a senior research analyst at CoinDesk Research, focused on developing metrics and analysis for crypto asset investors. Christine Kim is a research analyst for CoinDesk. She focusses on producing data-driven insights about the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.

Things change fast in crypto. The only prediction that seems safe is that the narratives and metrics that seem important today will be eclipsed by new ideas, in a matter of months.

Nonetheless, on the cusp of a new year and a new decade, we will attempt a look ahead at the important events and issues to watch in 2020. We fully expect this research note to age poorly, but here at the end of 2019 is a list of what CoinDesk Research expects to be watching closely in the coming year.

Sometime in May, bitcoin will go through a programmed halving of the block reward allotted to the miners who maintain the network on which it runs. This means miners who contribute computing power to the security of the network will receive half the number of bitcoins for each block of data they successfully record to bitcoin’s blockchain. To what extent is bitcoin’s price driven by supply-side economics? Are there predictable patterns of investment (and disillusionment) around the event itself? We hope to find out.

Telegram, a messaging platform, became the second-largest initial coin offering (ICO) of 2018. Shares in the ICO were sold in the US under an SEC exemption, with shareholders expecting delivery of a crypto token, whenever Telegram’s blockchain-based network goes live. In 2019, the SEC sued to block that asset distribution and Telegram is fighting back. Don’t expect this one to end in 2020, but the twists and turns along the way will actively shape how developers and investors view their prospects for distribution and use of new coins and tokens.

Will Facebook’s Libra project stick to its plan to launch a wallet to store and transfer the proposed stablecoin by June 2020? If it does, we’ll be watching closely for indicators to tell us whether Libra is fulfilling or falling short of its promise to bank the unbanked. And, we’ll hope to learn whether governments’ noted concerns over private currency issuance have basis in reality.

Since its founding, bitcoin has been tied to the idea that economic stimulus through monetary policy is a bad idea. With interest rates going negative in economies around the world, many bitcoiners seem to be watching the signs of impending global recession with something approaching glee. Bitcoin’s narrative tells us it’s “digital gold.” Therefore, it should act as a haven in times of economic downturn. Will it prove that story, or disprove it, or is it too early to tell? Global macro events and bitcoin markets’ reaction may tell us the answer.

The year 2019 saw commentary on bitcoin from the White House and the US Federal Reserve. Facebook’s entry into crypto assets brought digital currencies before Congress. In the polarized US political landscape, it’s unlikely that a polarizing issue like crypto will be a bipartisan issue. Look out for pro- and no-coin election-year stances on party lines, as each side stakes out its ground.

In 2019, increasing use of the stablecoin Tether tilted transaction volume toward crypto assets backed by off-chain assets, such as dollars, rather than assets that derive their value from on-chain network effects or other as-yet undefined fundamentals. Was that a tipping point, or a blip? The question is crucial to the still-unanswered conundrum: what is all this magic internet money supposed to be good for, anyway?

“DeFi,” or “decentralized finance,” is the latest narrative to capture the imagination of the ethereum-following futurists who believe decentralized applications and smart contracts are an invention on par with the joint stock corporation. For now, DeFi is a way for people who are already long ether to earn a little interest. Will it attract new users to crypto assets? Will banks without bankers allow global finance to make inroads into new parts of the global economy?

In 2019, Beijing’s talk of a digital yuan made China the first major economy on a path to issuing its own digital currency, based to some extent on bitcoin’s model for validating transactions and ownership. How would a digital yuan change crypto? How might it change the balance of economic power and the dollar’s status as global reserve currency? Will other countries move first, or follow? We may see the beginnings of a new chapter for an asset category that first gained adoption among libertarians.

While we have yet to see the approval for a regulated bitcoin exchange traded fund in the U.S., other cryptocurrency derivatives such as bitcoin futures have passed the necessary checks and scrutiny of U.S. regulators. Chairman of the Commodity Futures and Trade Commission Heath Tarbert went so far as to suggest in a speech this year that a regulated ethereum futures market in the U.S. is also not far off from being approved. How great of an impact might these new financial tools have on the level of institutional participation in crypto come 2020? At least from the trading volume of Bakkt futures, the answer so far seems to be not a lot. This might change however in the new year and is well worth watching for signs of significant growth.",2019-12-18 17:00:00+00:00,https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/lukka-debuts-diy-crypto-tax-prep-product,"Lukka, which makes blockchain products for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, has debuted a do-it-yourself tax preparation product for taxpayers reporting cryptocurrency assets on IRS Forms 1040 and 8949.

LukkaTax will be available for the 2019 tax season. LukkaTax was developed in partnership with CPA.com, the technology arm of the American Institute of CPAs. The alliance, announced in December, will first focus on building crypto asset solutions specifically for accounting firms and sole practitioners to support taxpayers who prefer to work with CPA firms, rather than handle tax preparation needs themselves. The first product released under the alliance is the virtual currency tax preparation tool, LukkaTax for Professionals . Practitioners purchase and use the tool to complete crypto data processes not supported by their existing tax preparation software solutions.



The new DIY software, available mid-January, leads taxpayers through a guided experience so they can calculate taxable gain or loss on crypto investments. LukkaTax evolved from LibraTax, Lukka’s commercial crypto tax calculator released in 2014, and is built to complete crypto data collection, enrichment, and calculation processes not supported by traditional tax preparation software solutions.

2019 will be the first year that the IRS will explicitly ask taxpayers to document their cryptocurrency — or ""virtual currency,"" as the IRS calls it — activity, prioritizing this question to the top of its new IRS Form 1040 Schedule 1. For those with cryptocurrency activity, transactional details must be itemized on IRS Form 8949 which includes cost basis, proceeds, and itemized gain or loss. If taxpayers did not report their crypto from previous years, it can be done so now by amending prior year returns, which can be done via LukkaTax.

Lukka offers other crypto-focused products that complement its DIY tax prep product. Lukka Prime is a fair market, value-based crypto asset pricing methodology; and Lukka Reference Data eliminates inconsistencies between constantly changing crypto ticker and pair mappings traded across various crypto exchange platforms.

“Lukka is bringing institutional-grade tax preparation products to all consumers with scalable and secure tools that have guided experiences and are incredibly easy to use,” said Jake Benson, founder and CEO of Lukka, in a statement. “Considering the intense IRS focus on compliance and lack of accuracy in prior year reporting, we believe that the do-it-yourself taxpayer requires a purpose-built crypto tax product they can trust will comply with IRS requirements; LukkaTax meets that need.”",2019-12-18 17:19:17.921,https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/quadriga-gerald-cotten-death-cryptocurrency.html,"In January, the Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga announced that its CEO and founder Gerald Cotten had passed away a month earlier from complications of Crohn’s disease while on honeymoon in India. Quadriga was, at one point, Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange and processed billions of dollars in trades. Cotten’s death, however, revealed a critical flaw in the cryptocurrency giant’s infrastructure: He was the only person who had access to the $180 million of cryptocurrency that its users held in their accounts. Some of Quadriga’s traders are now alleging that Cotten might have faked his death in order to abscond with their funds. Lawyers representing these traders sent a letter to Canadian law enforcement on Friday asking to exhume the body in Cotten’s grave to perform an autopsy.

This, obviously, raises lots of questions about how a crypto CEO might have gone about faking his own death—as well as one that’s more technical: How is it possible that a single person had sole access to the funds of one of Canada’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges?

Cotten was able to maintain this level of control over his customers’ assets in part because Quadriga had kept most of it in “cold wallets,” or hardware that allows exchanges to store cryptocurrency offline. Exchanges typically use cold wallets as bank vaults because they’re less vulnerable to hackers than hot wallets, which are connected to the internet.

“Best practices involve putting the bulk of the funds in cold storage and keeping on hand only a small amount of coins for the day-to-day operations [of an exchange],” says Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University who co-directs the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts.

In order to retrieve the funds in cold storage, you have to unlock the wallets with cryptographic keys, which are essentially strings of code. Cotten kept Quadriga’s keys only on his personal MacBook Pro. Vanity Fair reported that Cotten once caused a “momentary hysteria” by leaving his laptop on his yacht, which had already departed the dock. Cotten’s widow now says that no one can log in to the encrypted laptop, because he was the only one who knew the password. “It’s shocking, completely unbelievable that someone would have a multibillion-dollar operation run out of one laptop,” says Preston Byrne, a lawyer at the cryptocurrency-focused firm Byrne & Storm P.C. “They were really playing with fire there.”

Besides an untimely death, there are a number of scenarios in which using a personal laptop for key storage could be disastrous. Assuming that Cotten had connected his MacBook to the internet and used it for everyday tasks, a hacker may have been able to infiltrate or incapacitate the device. If he’d left it out in the open, someone could have stolen information manually. And based on prior reporting, it seems like he took laptop with him at least on occasion when he traveled, increasing the chance that it could’ve been lost or stolen.

According to Sirer, the most reliable way to secure an exchange’s cache of cryptocurrency is to split access between multiple individuals. Companies will oftentimes distribute what are known as key shares to three senior people. Any two of those key shares can be combined to unlock the funds. Sirer says, “It’s a good idea because the loss of any one share doesn’t affect the operation, and it takes two people to steal funds.” And rather than using a personal laptop, you’d typically want to store the cryptographic information on a hardware security module, which is a device specifically designed for managing digital keys, and lock it away in a vault.

The only apparent reasons why someone would keep all the key information on a single MacBook Pro would be either due to extreme sloppiness or to engineer an exit scam in which a CEO disappears with customers’ cryptocurrency. Most CEOs don’t have sole access to key information nowadays, though you would have been more likely to see this sort of risky key storage with small- or medium-sized exchanges in the early days of cryptocurrency at the beginning of the decade. “Back then, pretty much every exchange operation, with maybe the exception of Coinbase, was pretty amateurish,” says Byrne. “Now, the bigger exchanges tend to be better funded and more sophisticated, and I don’t think you really see a whole lot of them doing this. But who knows? We just don’t know.” When choosing a cryptocurrency exchange, it can be difficult to discern just how secure it is. However, you can check to see whether the company has been audited by an independent firm, which would likely involve reviewing how it stored its cryptographic keys—as well as any other, um, interesting risks.",2019-12-18 22:02:18.192000+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/club-swan-spend-your-crypto-now/,"A Better Alternative to Banking - Club Swan

FILE PHOTO: An employee works on Bitcoin mining computer as a PC screen shows the fluctuations in Bitcoin exchange rates at Bitminer Factory in Florence, Italy, April 6, 2018. Picture taken April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo

No one’s in control of this process. It’s a rule written into bitcoin’s underlying code by its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than a decade ago.

The event, expected in May 2020, slashes by half the number of new coins awarded to bitcoin miners who provide global supply of the cryptocurrency by solving complex maths puzzles.

That’s a big change in a market worth about $120 billion where bitcoin worth several billions dollars are created every year.

Players in the know are preparing for the sharp price gains and volatility that have accompanied previous halvings, which happen roughly every four years and act to both ensure the scarcity of bitcoin and keep a cap on price inflation.

There are likely to be winners and losers. So market participants, from bitcoin miners and traders, are trying to fathom how the next halving might play out to gain an edge.

“This is the biggest question right now for most of the industry,” said Eyal Avramovich, chief executive of MineBest, a Warsaw-based company that mines bitcoin.

The fracture to the production of bitcoin provides a reminder of one reason why the decentralized digital currency has confounded regulation and acceptance by mainstream finance: Its fate remains tied to arcane technological factors.

In theory, if supply is cut and demand stays constant, prices rise. This time around, seven crypto traders and miners interviewed by Reuters said the May halving would probably lead to greater volatility and trading volumes. However the cut to supply is liked to be more priced in than previously, they said, with many traders already geared up for the upcoming event.

(GRAPHIC: Bitcoin's halving - )

MAKING MONEY FROM SWINGS

Bitcoin miners use high-spec computers to compete against other machines in the crypto network, racing to add new “blocks” to the blockchain ledger that underpins the cryptocurrency.

They are rewarded with a set number of bitcoin, currently 12.5. At current rates of block creation, the next halving will take place in May, when the number will drop to 6.25.

In the one-year periods after the two previous halvings, in November 2012 and July 2016, bitcoin rose around by 80 times and four times respectively. It is not clear how much of these price gains was down to the halving, versus with other factors.

This time around, bitcoin derivatives markets - still nascent - point to higher volatility around the time of the halving, said Jeff Dorman of Arca, a U.S. crypto investment firm.

Such volatility in bitcoin markets tends to benefit quantitative hedge funds and high-frequency traders that seek to make money from swinging crypto prices.

“For us, the event will be positive because it cause activity in the market,” said Ha Duong of Cambrial, an cryptocurrency investor in Berlin.

But for miners that hold large inventories of bitcoin, volatility can also be a hindrance. For them, stability of price gives greater predictability for investment in new gear.

While bitcoin futures contracts allow miners to hedge the risk of their inventories, there are currently few tools for them to properly hedge against volatility, said Ricky Li, co-founder of crypto trader Altonomy.

“If you want to long volatility, the options contracts available for the market right now really do not have the tenor (length),” he said.

“Right now all you can do is to just make sure your holdings risk, your inventory risk, is hedged.”",2019-12-19 10:59:34+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/whales-control-most-of-litecoin-many-ethereum-tokens/,"Whales Control Most of Litecoin, Many Ethereum Tokens

A new study of 140,000 crypto addresses finds that few accounts are needed to form majority ownership of many coins. More than half of all LTC is held in just 189 non-exchange addresses, and on average, the top 100 ERC20 tokens are majority-owned by just 34 addresses. Almost 1 in 4 tokens had a majority owned by the project founder. In contrast, you need over 1,100 of the top addresses to control the majority of bitcoin cash.

Whales Still Dominate Much of Crypto

Clovr, a research-focused cryptocurrency company, has analyzed the wealth distribution among 140,000 non-exchange addresses from four major cryptocurrencies and the 100 most valuable Ethereum tokens. The researchers found that surprisingly few accounts are needed to form majority ownership of many coins and that some currencies have more unequal distribution of wealth now than they did in 2018.

Some of the richest addresses are owned by exchanges, which hold the wealth of many people. To find a close approximation of individual whales, the study removed all addresses known or predicted to be owned by an exchange. The researchers identified addresses that belonged to 41 exchanges using wallet nicknames associated with each address and predicted which anonymous addresses were owned by exchanges by cross-referencing address names across currencies.

The study investigated the wealth distribution of four major cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, and litecoin – and found that last had the most centralized wealth. Just 189 addresses are needed to own a majority of all LTC. The 10 richest litecoin accounts owned a tenth of all LTC wealth.

Litecoin may have the most unequal distribution of wealth out of the four major currencies analyzed, but ether has seen its wealth inequality rise significantly since 2018. This is based on the Gini index, a classic measure of wealth distribution in economics, which was used to measure the spread of wealth across each currency’s 10,000 richest addresses. The data shows that ether’s wealth inequality rose by 13% from 2018 to 2019. BTC had the lowest wealth inequality of the four major cryptocurrencies, with BCH the next after it.

“The fact that a few whales hold as much wealth as many small fry is true of all financial realms. It’s a hot topic among cryptocurrency enthusiasts because the lower liquidity and higher volatility in cryptomarkets mean whales can make bigger waves,” the researchers explained. “Concentrated ownership of wealth creates serious points of failure in a system designed to be robust through decentralization. This is perhaps most true for centralized exchanges, the singular custodians of many people’s wealth. Such failure can and does happen. The bigger the whale, the bigger the target – hackers and scammers hunt with big harpoons.”

Big Fish in Small Ponds

ERC20 tokens, those using the Ethereum platform, generally exhibit a lot of inequality. The researchers found that among the 100 Ethereum tokens with the highest market caps, the average number of addresses holding a majority was just 34. But the size of the majority group varied widely from token to token. Twenty-four of the 100 largest tokens were majority-owned by one address, almost always the token founder’s.

This inequality is often due to the way the availability of tokens is controlled by the founder, but having such centralized wealth brings its own risks. The initial coin offerings (ICOs) used to fund some tokens were identified as pump and dump scams, enticing investments that boosted the token’s value, only for the founder to cash out on the large number of tokens they withheld.

However, according to the study, the distribution of wealth in a token or coin may mean different things depending on how the currency originated. Huobi’s tokens had the highest wealth inequality of all ERC20 tokens, according to the analysis, but Huobi token was not funded via an initial coin offering and, therefore, possibly didn’t expose investors to the same level of risk.

To help understand which tokens are most likely to have very unequal distributions of wealth — a sign that a market could potentially be easily dominated by few individuals or manipulated by its founder — the researchers related the “top-heaviness” of tokens’ wealth distribution to the tokens’ market capitalization. A top-heavy wealth distribution would be one where large amounts of wealth were held by a small number of addresses – defined here by the log ratio of the mean address wealth to the median address wealth.

The higher a token’s market cap was the more likely the distribution of wealth was evenly spread compared to other tokens. In other words, the tokens that showed the greatest concentration of wealth in the fewest addresses were all tokens that have relatively small market capitalization – $100 million or less, in fact.

“These smaller token projects are lucrative investments for some because the returns can be monumental, but potential rewards reflect the risk,” the researchers warned. “Investors should do their research and consider many factors before buying any cryptocurrency. Just make sure one of the things you consider is how big the whales are in your sea – either you can swim in the current, or you’ll be swept along in their wake.”

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.

Cryptocurrencies have kept a relatively low profile in 2019 following a record-breaking rise in 2017 and then a spectacular crash in 2018. Are they worth revisiting in 2020? We asked these experts and Advisors in The Oracles to share where they think crypto is headed next.

1. Cryptocurrency will transform banking.

The world is getting ready for a financial and banking transformation. Engineers and product developers have been hard at work getting products together to bring Bitcoin to general use and distribution. In a year, there will be no reason to pay banks 2.5 percent to 4 percent every time you swipe your credit card. Bitcoin is a frictionless transaction. As it and other tokens like Tezos, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash become more prevalent, their value will increase. I predict a $250,000 Bitcoin price by 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. —Tim Draper, legendary VC, founder of Draper Associates and DFJ, and author of “How to Be the Startup Hero”

2. It’s excellent, long term.

Image credit: The Oracles

Whether you invest in crypto now should depend on whether you believe in the potential of blockchain technology. Yes, it didn’t live up to everyone’s expectations right away, but that’s also happened with basically every other disruptive technology. Investing in crypto now could be like picking up Amazon stock for less than IPO price, or it could be like stocking up on Betamaxes on clearance. Only time will tell.

Our developers at AE Studio work with blockchain companies like Protocol Labs, and we’re constantly impressed with the progress and innovation that’s happening in the space. Blockchain technology is evolving fast and becoming increasingly important; so I think of crypto as an excellent long-term, albeit high-risk, investment. If you think so too, my No. 1 piece of advice is to invest no more than you can afford to lose in things like BTC and ETH, which will likely positively correlate with blockchain adoption. And hodl long term! —Judd Rosenblatt, founder and CEO of AE Studio, an Agile web development and data science consulting firm with a mission to increase human agency with technology; vote for the charity they donate to next month

3. It’s the future.

While the markets may have crashed, the growth of the infrastructure enabling cryptocurrency has never really slowed down, especially at Skrill. According to many industry experts, the space is now stable, more mature, and ready to move into its next phase. To see something that started as no more than an idea in the depths of the internet spawn a new ecosystem and grow into a multibillion-dollar asset class is nothing short of remarkable to me. The largest companies and countries in the world now discuss cryptocurrency as a viable currency of the future. I would just remind budding investors that trading in such a dynamic space means the stakes are higher. Proper research and risk management are essential. —Lorenzo Pellegrino, CEO of Skrill, NETELLER, and Income Access at Paysafe; connect with Lorenzo on LinkedIn

4. Bitcoin will beat the critics — and here’s why.

Image credit: The Oracles

Remember the historic economic crash 10 years ago, when many people’s life savings were wiped out? That’s when Bitcoin was born; a cryptocurrency created partly in response to the leading financial intermediaries that helped bring down the economy.

Bitcoin has become more widely adopted for several reasons. It has a predictable inflation rate because only 21 million will ever be produced. It is borderless, with transparency that no bank can match. And it is trustless because the system was designed so you don’t have to trust anyone else for it to function. It has been declared dead by journalists 378 times, including 40 times this year. But Bitcoin won’t die because it can be trusted more than most government currencies. There is no intermediary. And in a world full of failed financial intermediaries, that is a big deal. —Dan Schatt, co-founder and CEO of Cred; connect with Dan on LinkedIn

5. Cryptocurrency adoption today is where the internet used to be.

Image credit: The Oracles

The cryptocurrency decline was good for the market because it taught investors that not all coins are as shiny as they might seem. We always encourage making decisions based on real market value instead of speculation. How do you measure the value of a token without deep knowledge? Look for platforms that can be integrated into enterprise processes to enhance their workflows. That’s how mass adoption happens.

When the internet started, companies had to integrate the technology to deliver content for users to consume. That’s where we are now with cryptocurrency, but we’re missing platforms that companies can leverage and are capable of operating on a global scale. That’s likely why the ROI of tokens from the top 11 blockchain platforms (WAVES, EOS, NEO, ETH, LSK, ADA, MATIC, FTM, ZIL, TRX, and ALGO) averages more than 1,000 percent. —Johann Polecsak, co-founder and CTO of QAN blockchain platform; connect with Johann on LinkedIn

6. 2020 will bring a historical milestone.

Image credit: The Oracles

In 1997, Amazon went public at $18 per share. The stock grew to over $300 per share before plummeting to under $6 when the dot-com bubble burst in 2001. Fast forward to 2018: Amazon reached $2,050 per share and became the second U.S. company to eclipse $1 trillion in stock market value. Many investors see this pattern happening with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin skyrocketed from about $3,600 per coin to over $19,000 in 2017. Then it fell below $3,500 before climbing to $12,000 in 2019.

My advice is to keep an eye on the Bitcoin halving in 2020, which can dramatically change the cryptocurrency supply and demand equation. I believe it will be remembered as a historical milestone for Bitcoin and the entire industry. It could be the turning point that takes Bitcoin from a niche, unstable asset to a mainstream form of payment. —Alex Althausen, CEO of StormGain, a cryptocurrency trading platform; connect with Alex on LinkedIn

At the time, I mostly focused on crypto-linked financial products, including the long-awaited bitcoin ETF. But while the majority of my predictions about the financialization of crypto came true, there’s one notable story my crystal ball didn’t reveal: the growing role of large social media players.

The story of 2019 has been Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra, announced in June, and its many missteps. I hardly could’ve predicted the ZuckBuck, let alone the PR saga that followed.

Libra’s wobbly beginnings took many by surprise—and quickly caused outrage. Policymakers accused Mark Zuckerberg of trying to create his own money, ostensibly to compete against the traditional financial system. And while Facebook has stood by a 2020 launch date for Libra, it seems the chances of the digital currency going live are dwindling. (Of course, even if Libra doesn’t launch, the company’s financial aspirations are clear: Facebook is already expanding its other payments services, such as WhatsApp Pay.)

Mirroring Libra, there hasn’t yet been a digital currency revolution on the global scale, either. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been a relative nonstarter. As world citizens, we must take seriously whispers about China’s digital yuan, but to date, the greatest evidence of CBDCs has arrived in the form of Venezuela’s petro crypto and the Marshall Islands’ very questionable national crypto. Realistically, broad-based crypto money—government-backed or otherwise—remains a pipe dream.

As we look ahead though, there are two major trends worth following: 1) the slow unraveling of ethereum, the second-largest crypto project, and 2) the seeds of decentralized social media, currently being explored by Twitter and others. Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, has funded decentralization research and open-source development of bitcoin (via Square, his payments company), nodding to a vastly different future for the web.

Regardless of whether these visions—distributed online platforms and deflationary, non-government currency—take hold, it’s clear that Twitter and Square are anticipating and responding to social changes. Before any of you complain that Dorsey’s late to the game, I’ll remind you: It doesn’t matter who starts, it matters who finishes.

My 2019 predictions, revisited

The SEC won’t approve a bitcoin ETF



Right! As of writing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission still hasn’t approved a bitcoin ETF. As the stock market regulator worries about bitcoin market manipulation, it seems unlikely to sign off on any financial vehicles to enable further speculation. For what it’s worth, even without an ETF, bitcoin rebounded almost 80% this year—jumping from $3,850 on Jan. 1 to $6,870 at the time of writing.

Privacy coins will make a resurgence

Partially right. So, I can’t give myself full credit for this. But in the first quarter of 2019, privacy coins like Grin and Beam were all the rage. Since then, it seems interest has tailed off. And based on price alone, I don’t deserve more than half-credit. Zcash has dropped nearly 50%, from $57 on Jan. 1 to $29 at the time of writing. *Grimace.* But Monero has remained fairly stable—$48 on Jan. 1 to $46 today.

The CFTC will approve ether futures



Wrong, so far. Admittedly, this was my most bullish prediction and I whiffed. Although ether futures haven’t come to market in 2019, there’s a good chance it will happen soon. My assessment was simply a bit premature. Earlier this year, the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission even said ether futures in 2020 were “likely.” And if there’s one person to trust, it’d be him.

Ethereum’s Proof of Stake will continue to be a mess



Right again! I saved my favorite prediction for last because, well, it’s a doozy. In addition to the Ethereum Foundation’s Virgil Griffith being arrested for allegedly helping North Korea evade sanctions, the project has endured yet another tough year. What matters is that ethereum’s claims of a new, decentralized internet are, well, essentially nonsense.

I’ve been reserved in my criticism, but ethereum’s most recent debacle is laughable—developers built in an “Ice Age” mechanism to slow the network and incentivize themselves to upgrade it (to Proof of Stake, an alternative issuance model). But in the latest network update, they forgot to push back the “Ice Age,” so now they have to update again. This could’ve killed ethereum, but all’s well that ends well, right? Right?!

In an industry built around digital scarcity, opinions are in plentiful supply. Everyone’s got one, and they’d love to share it with the rest of the cryptosphere. As the decade draws to a close and another prepares to launch, it’s the perfect time to consider what 2020 has in store. Here’s what thought leaders, professionals, and investors have to say about the trends that will define the coming year – starting with the predicted price of BTC.

Also read: Which Token Will Be Next Year’s 50x Winner?

In 2020, the price of BTC Will Reach…

Where BTC will venture next year depends heavily on whether you believe May 2020’s halving event is priced in – which no one can seem to agree on. The rational market theory holds that investors have had years in which to prepare, and thus the slashing of BTC’s block reward should have little effect on pricing. But since when have “rational” and “crypto markets” ever been synonymous? “Bitcoin needs bigger macro catalysts than a marginal 2% point reduction in inflation rates,” believes Messari’s Ryan Selkis. Yele Bademosi of Binance Labs expects that “the lowest price of BTC in 2020 will be higher than the yearly low of 2019 (~$3,300).”



Blockchain Capital believes BTC will surpass $20k in 2020, as does Su Zhu of Three Arrows Capital, while a partner at The Spartan Group believes bitcoin will reach $40k, and he’s not alone, with other bulls including Bithumb’s Seonil Moon, who has predicted that “in 2020, institutional investors will move beyond testing and will start to create new demand for crypto.” With Bitcoin Cash also due to halve its block reward next year, and Blockchain Capital predicting onchain BTC fees to hit $100, 2020 may also smile kindly on BCH. Next year’s biggest bull is John McAfee, of course, but no one in the industry believes his $200k EOY prediction for BTC will come to pass.

Blockchain Networks to Watch out for in 2020

The severity of the threat presented by quantum computing remains a matter of intense debate, with new breakthroughs in quantum supremacy by Google focusing attention on the security of crypto networks. There’s less debate over the prominence that quantum-resistant networks will play next year, which several crypto crystal ball-gazers have tipped to prosper in 2020. This includes Quantum Resistant Ledger, which has obtained draft approval from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) for Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes, the technology that secures its blockchain. QRL is about to hard fork to integrate decentralized onchain governance and more distributed mining with Randomx, and is one to watch next year.

Also tipped to prosper are smart contract blockchains that can rival Ethereum. In his 71-page Crypto Theses for 2020, Messari’s Ryan Selkis has highlighted Polkadot, which is set to launch next year, and Cosmos as the likeliest to succeed in this regard. He’s predicted that high volume dapps such as Earnbet, which has encountered scaling problems on EOS, will “build on their own Polkadot parachain or Cosmos zones.”

Web3 Protocols Tipped to Gain Ground

The decentralized web, borne along by Web3 technologies including IPFS, is also expected to come good in 2020. With Twitter’s Jack Dorsey launching Bluesky, a decentralized social media protocol, the spotlight has been shone on a vertical that promises to return data control to its owners and spawn censorship-resistant web platforms. On December 18, the New York Times addressed this trend, with Nathaniel Popper observing that “Decentralization used to be the thing the upstarts said would allow them to defeat Twitter and Facebook. Now Twitter and Facebook have adopted it as the solution to all the problems they are facing.”

Web3 projects that are projected to prosper next year include Cyber, a protocol that operates on top of IPHS (Interplanetary File System), providing an information consensus system for answers and a search engine. Its Interplanetary Search Engine and consensus computer will essentially form a decentralized Google that utilizes knowledge graphs. Permaweb storage solution Arweave, decentralized DNS Handshake, and Filecoin, which will launch in 2020, will also play a key role.

Next Year’s Likeliest to Succeed Altcoins

News.Bitcoin.com recently shared a list of predictions on the tokens likely to fare well in next year’s market. To that list can be added DOT – Polkadot’s native token – which Spartan Black expects to eventually reach a market cap in excess of Ethereum’s, reasoning “In China, it is the only project that comes anywhere close to Ethereum in terms of profile, community and investor interest.” He also expects Maker’s MKR to exceed $1,000.

Experts are less bullish on Telegram’s TON and Filecoin in terms of valuation, on account of the projects having launched late and raised amidst peak 2017-18 valuations. Blockchain Capital has predicted that none of the layer one networks to launch in 2020 will enter the top 10 by market cap. Spartan Black expects SNX and BAT to increase their market caps next year, but DOGE, NEO, and ICX to lose ground. Finally, Bram Cohen of Chia predicts that tether (USDT) will become the third largest digital asset by market cap.

Exchange Predictions

Coingecko’s Bobby Ong is skeptical that the exchange blockchains being developed by Huobi, Bithumb, Gate.io, and Okex will prosper next year, but is bullish on crypto derivatives, predicting that “Most crypto exchanges will start offering options to compete against Deribit.” Ari Nazir of Neural Capital anticipates that “Exchange tokens will continue to be the strongest performing non-vaporware investments in crypto.”

Bybit’s Ben Zhou has taken a more philosophical view of next year’s exchange landscape, telling news.Bitcoin.com: “As always, crypto remains a highly competitive market. I enjoy the constant competition as it reminds us to never rest on our laurels. However, we do not want to get too wrapped up in competing that we lose sight of our own goals. As Edward de Bono once said, ‘Companies that solely focus on competition will die. Those that focus on value creation will thrive.’”

These are my guesses for 2020 pic.twitter.com/ESa2Hgtukq — nic carter (@nic__carter) December 19, 2019

Staking as a service, which is now dominated by exchanges, is tipped to wither away next year due to saturation and increased awareness of the dilution caused by inflationary staking networks. “Staking fees will drop to near zero in 2020 and more than half of the 200+ stakers will go out of business,” predicts Spartan Black. Both he and Bobby Ong anticipate staking fees levied by exchanges will be slashed in a bid to compete with Binance. Ryan Selkis, meanwhile, cut straight to the point, writing “inflationary staking rewards are without qualification the dumbest thing this industry has deluded itself into believing since white paper investing caught fire in mid-2017.”

Decentralized Finance

Predicting the amount of value locked up in decentralized finance has become a variant on the annual BTC price prediction game. Defipulse.com currently records this figure as $645M, with Bobby Ong expecting $1B to be surpassed next year. Blockchain Capital is more bullish still, tipping $5 billion. Ong has also predicted that at least one defi app will be hacked next year, as does Charlie Noyes of Paradigm who projects that “at least one DAO is taken over by overtly malicious colluding voters for >$1mm in profit.”

Ryan Selkis anticipates further VC investment in defi-based wallet services “to compete as the gateways to crypto for “self-sovereign” crypto users.” The Block has predicted that next year will see greater leverage for defi derivatives, more liquidity, and more sophisticated financial products.

Bitcoin layer two solution Lightning Network, whose $6.2M of locked up BTC is recorded by defi aggregators such as Defipulse, may not fare so well next year. As news.Bitcoin.com recently showed, LN still isn’t ready for the masses, and even some of its former proponents have changed their tune. “Lightning is taking more time to develop than I’d originally thought,” conceded Ryan Selkis, writing that “it’s tough not to be disappointed with its lack of growth” in 2019.

Whatever 2020 may hold for bitcoin, altcoins, and the rest of the cryptoconomy, investors are eagerly looking forward to the dawn of a new decade. It’s a chance to wipe the slate clean and start with renewed determination to avoid shitcoins, dubious ICOs, and outright Ponzi schemes. Only time will tell whether the coming year will smile kindly upon the cryptosphere, bringing profitable trades and vindicated predictions to the current crop of crypto clairvoyants.

According to a letter written by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jessica Fender and Sheb Swett on behalf of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, “it is anticipated that defendant Reginald Fowler will enter a change of plea at the next court conference.”

U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter, who is overseeing the case in the Southern District of New York, endorsed the letter on Thursday, canceling a hearing set for Jan. 8, 2020 and setting one for Jan. 10, 2020.

Fowler, one of the alleged co-founders of payment processor Crypto Capital, was indicted and arrested earlier this year on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and operation of an unlicensed money transmission business, alongside Israeli national Ravid Yosef. According to an indictment, the pair opened bank accounts at various financial institutions to store funds on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges, but told the banks they would process real estate transactions.

While Yosef was also charged, she has not yet been arrested.

Fowler pled “not guilty” to all four charges during a hearing in June 2019.

Crypto Capital

Crypto Capital is otherwise known as the payment processor used by Bitfinex, QuadrigaCX, CEX.io and other exchanges in the past, after these firms had difficulty securing banking services.

Bitfinex famously stored close to $1 billion with Crypto Capital, which it lost access to after the company’s bank accounts were frozen by law enforcement authorities in multiple countries.

All told, Bitfinex lost $850 million, as revealed by the New York Attorney General’s office in an ongoing inquiry begun in April.

Bitfinex filed for a subpoena to depose individuals associated with Crypto Capital in an effort to regain its funds.

According to the subpoena, Bitfinex was unaware that Fowler had opened the bank accounts holding its funds in his name, rather than Crypto Capital’s.",2019-12-19 22:33:05+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-opposition-leader-navalny-raises-700000-in-crypto-donations/,"Russian Opposition Leader Navalny Raises $700,000 in Crypto Donations

Alexei Navalny, Russia’s leading critic of the current Kremlin administration, has attracted a serious amount of cryptocurrency in the form of anonymous donations for his corruption-combatting NGO. The digital coins collected since the beginning of this year have amounted to well over $700,000 at current prices.

Anti-Corruption Foundation Collects 110 BTC in 2019

Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (abbr. FBK in Russian), which investigates alleged cases of high-profile corruption in Russia, has received 109.6 BTC between Jan. 1 and Dec. 1, 2019, the Russian edition of RT reported this week. At the time of writing, that’s close to 49 million rubles or around $780,000. The bulk of the donations have been made between April and September, during the run-up to the Moscow city council election.

The TV channel tracks all transactions to the wallet used by FBK since 2017. The BTC address 3QzYvaRFY6bakFBW4YBRrzmwzTnfZcaA6E, which belongs to Navalny’s campaign manager Leonid Volkov, was initially published on the “Navalny 20!8” website after his bid for last year’s presidential election was announced in 2016. It was meant to be used until the candidate’s team registered an official fundraising account but supporters have continued to send crypto funds to this day.

A quick check using the Bitcoin.com block explorer shows that over 638 BTC (approximately $4.5 million today) has been deposited so far and that most of the money has been withdrawn already. The current balance stands at around 0.05 BTC after a total of 2,770 transactions. According to RT, 262.4 BTC were sent to the wallet in 2017 and another 242.2 BTC were deposited during the following year.

March, April, June, and September have been the months with the most transactions this year. In April 2019, when the campaign for the Moscow election started, the wallet received 31.7 BTC which is more than the funds raised during each of the previous months. 12.6 BTC were transferred to the same address in September with most of the money, 10.45 BTC, sent in a single transaction days after the vote for the city’s parliament. The amount was transferred from the 3DdBZ734DjaqBf29PvjxWv9mvU6VaQEs8H address which, according to the publication, is FBK’s biggest crypto sponsor, with 12 donations worth over 25.6 BTC in April alone.

FBK Registered as a ‘Foreign Agent’

Transactions to and from the FBK cryptocurrency wallet have decreased significantly since the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened a criminal case against people involved in the Anti-Corruption Foundation in early August. Only 1.47 ВТС were deposited by the end of that month. Donations dropped to a total of 0.54 BTC in October before bouncing back to 4.81 BTC in November.

The probe was launched into an alleged “legalizing” of illicit funds by Navalny’s NGO during opposition protests in Moscow this past summer. Russian investigators suspect members of the foundation and individuals associated with its activities of laundering 1 billion rubles (over $15 million) over the course of the past three years.

During the antigovernment demonstrations, the organizers of which are close to Navalny, the opposition leader himself was serving a 30-day prison term for inciting what authorities consider to be illegal protests against the banning of certain opposition candidates from running in the Russian capital’s elections. Hundreds of participants in the “unsanctioned” gatherings and walks through the city center were detained.

Then, in October, the Russian Justice Ministry added FBK to a list of “foreign agents.” According to the ministry, Navalny’s foundation meets the criteria of that definition while the organization maintains it’s not receiving any funding from abroad. More than 70 entities have so far been listed as foreign agents since the adoption of a special law governing their activities in 2012.

According to the legislation, a foreign agent can be either a private individual or an organization that’s involved in Russian politics but receives funds from foreign entities. Those that have been labeled as such by the Russian state are required to submit regular financial declarations, report their activities and are subject to annual audits.

Accounting for income or donations received in cryptocurrency is difficult in Russia where digital coins don’t have a legal status yet. A package of laws and amendments was introduced in the State Duma last year but the final adoption of the main bill, the law “On digital financial assets,” has been postponed multiple times due to various reasons including disagreements between the Central Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance over the status of decentralized cryptocurrencies.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has proposed amending the definition of “accredited investor” — a move that will increase access to regulated cryptocurrency investments. A number of them are currently only available to accredited investors. Among other changes, a person can qualify based on professional knowledge, experience, or certifications.

Modernizing SEC’s Approach

The SEC announced on Wednesday that it has proposed “to update accredited investor definition to increase access to investments,” which would result in more people being able to participate in SEC-regulated private capital markets. “The proposal seeks to update and improve the definition to more effectively identify institutional and individual investors that have the knowledge and expertise to participate in our private capital markets,” the Commission’s announcement reads. Chairman Jay Clayton elaborated:

The current test for individual accredited investor status takes a binary approach to who does and does not qualify based only a person’s income or net worth … Modernization of this approach is long overdue.

The proposal also amends the definition of “qualified institutional buyer” in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Certain limited liability companies and rural business investment companies (RBICs) will be added to the types of entities that are eligible for the qualified institutional buyer status. There will also be a “catch-all” category aimed at institutional accredited investors.

New Categories to Be Added

“The proposal would add additional means for individuals to qualify to participate in our private capital markets based on established, clear measures of financial sophistication,” Clayton continued. “I also am pleased that the proposal specifically recognizes that certain organizations, such as tribal governments, should not be restricted from participating in our private capital markets.” The SEC added:

The proposed amendments to the accredited investor definition would add new categories of natural persons based on professional knowledge, experience, or certifications.

According to the proposal, natural persons may “qualify as accredited investors based on certain professional certifications and designations, such as a Series 7, 65 or 82 license, or other credentials issued by an accredited educational institution.”

For private fund investments, there would be “a new category based on the person’s status as a ‘knowledgeable employee’ of the fund.” Other proposed additions include those concerning limited liability companies, registered investment advisers, rural business investment companies, family offices, and spousal equivalent. The SEC is accepting public comments on the proposal for 60 days.

More Eligible Investors for Crypto Investments

While the SEC has not approved any bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a number of crypto investments are available to accredited investors. According to the SEC’s current definition, an accredited investor includes:

Anyone who earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, or has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of the person’s primary residence).

Among crypto investments available only to accredited investors are those offered by Bitwise Asset Management. “Investors must be accredited and U.S.-based,” the company’s website notes. Bitwise had a proposed rule change filed with the SEC for a bitcoin ETF called Bitwise Bitcoin ETF but it was rejected in October. However, that decision is currently under review.

Another company with crypto investment products for accredited investors is Grayscale Investments. Its website explains that products offered are private investment vehicles that are not registered with the SEC or any other regulatory agencies, adding that their offerings are “made only to certain qualified investors who are ‘accredited investors’ as defined under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.”

What do you think of the SEC amending the definition of “accredited investor”? Let us know in the comments section below.

New cryptos have emerged and given the blockchain forefather a run for its (digital) money. Most notable among them is Ethereum, which is both an online currency and a platform for creating smart contracts and blockchain-supported apps. It typically runs second to Bitcoin in overall value but has been adopted by some corporate entities, acquiring a possible edge in legitimacy.

But the number two cryptocurrency, Ethereum, won’t have any chance at all to outperform Bitcoin if the current level on ETH/BTC price charts is lost, according to one outspoken crypto trader.

Ethereum Won’t Outperform Bitcoin Anytime Soon If Current Support Breaks Down

After spending most of 2017 being inflated by the ICO boom, Ethereum reached an all-time high price of $1,400, then went on to spend all of 2018 deflating alongside the crypto bubble, reaching a low of $80.

Ethereum has not fared well in 2019, especially not in comparison to Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency started out the year around $150, nearly double the price of its bottom, but has since fallen back below that number, and is trading at roughly $125 at the time of this writing.

Because Ethereum and other altcoins have so underperformed next to the first-ever cryptocurrency, many analysts had been expecting an alt season to occur that could even the score against Bitcoin maximalists who have watched the king of crypto absorb the capital from nearly every other crypto asset on the market throughout 2019.

However, according to a price chart shared by one outspoken crypto trader, if the current level acting as support on ETH/BTC price charts fails to hold, any chance of Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin in the near term dies along with the support.

ETHBTC Must Hold 0.018 on Ratio Or Risk For Further Decline Increases

The analyst is specifically looking at the 0.018 level on the ratio, which acted as support in August, but later was broken through as resistance turned support once again in September.

ETH/BTC has remained above the key level since then, holding throughout October, November, and now December, but is once again flirting with a break of the line.

If 0.018 fails on the ETH/BTC ratio, an attempt to retest 0.016 is the next likely scenario, and if that level breaks, it could be an extremely long time before any altcoins, Ethereum or otherwise, stand a chance at performing strongly against Bitcoin.

During the last two weeks as cryptocurrency prices slid below long term foundational support, speculators assumed Plustoken scammers may be behind the dump. Blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis published a report which claimed Plustoken coin sales might be dragging BTC prices down. Moreover, on December 19, Plustoken scammers moved 789,525 ETH ($101 million) from one address to another.

$101 Million of Ethereum Moves

On December 16, the blockchain surveillance firm Chainalysis published an excerpt from its January 2020 report indicating the Plustoken Ponzi scheme might be behind the declining crypto prices this year. The Plustoken project was a wallet created by a group of South Korean nationals who told people the wallet would reward users with 6-18% in monthly profits. By the time the scam ended with arrests, close to $3 billion dollars in a variety of digital assets had been defrauded from Plustoken users. Chainalysis called the Plustoken scam one of the largest crypto-based Ponzis ever created. Following the report, BTC dropped below the $7k zone and Kim Grauer, senior economist at Chainalysis, said that Plustoken scammers dumping is “certainly something to consider” when thinking about where the short term price is going.

Since then, BTC’s fiat value jumped back above the $7k region and other digital assets followed suit, regaining losses. However, crypto enthusiasts and traders are aware that the Plustoken scammers still have 20,000 more BTC to unload and 789,000 ETH as well. Then on December 19, armchair sleuths noticed that the 789,525 ETH ($101.2 million at press time) had moved from one address to another. The cofounder of Three Arrows Capital, Su Zhu, spotted the 789k ETH movement and said: “Imagine if they throw this into ETH2 Phase0 staking — Perpetual endowment yield.” The ETH has since been resting in the wallet and has not moved since Thursday. The funds are flagged by ETH block explorers like Etherscan and in red the transaction notes the ETH stems from the “Plustoken Scam.”

Someone Claims to Be the Plustoken Scammers and Government Conspiracy

After the 789,000 ETH moved, an account tied to the social media site Bishijie.com explained in a video recorded in Mandarin that they were associated with the Plustoken transactions. The CEO of Sino Global Capital, Matthew Graham, shared the video on Twitter and said: “Plustoken scammers trying to explain away their token transactions, the brazenness is really incredible.”

“Note: it’s important to understand that we don’t have full visibility on what’s going on here,” Graham stressed, alluding that the person could be lying. “This may be people affiliated, but not really part of the original team, it’s hard to say exactly,” he added. According to another person, the Mandarin speaker’s words loosely translated indicates that “the speaker just describes the transfers (e.g. xxx ETH was transferred from address A to address B) and frames it as ‘good news’ and ‘moving house’ but doesn’t really give a particular reason.”

The large sum of ETH has the cryptocurrency community on edge and lots of people are discussing it on Twitter. “There is now $100M worth of stolen ETH from Plustoken Ponzi sitting in one ETH wallet,” The Block analyst Larry Cermak tweeted. “[The] majority of stolen BTC has already been laundered by using various mixing techniques and through Huobi — Can anything be done if the scammers start swapping ETH on Uniswap?” Cermak asked. BTC proponent Alistair Milne had a different theory about the Plustoken scammers and said: “Plustoken holdings are being liquidated by the authorities.” Milne hypothesized that private keys were probably surrendered upon arrests and “coins are mixed to try to obfuscate in order to not be interpreted as a government ‘endorsement’ of Huobi.”

“They will sell more carefully now people are aware,” Milne added. Despite the blockchain analysis reports from multiple intelligence teams and the variety of Plustoken-based coin movements over the last few weeks, the public are left still guessing.

Digital currencies have the potential to bridge the global wealth gap, hedge-fund chief Mark Yusko told Business Insider.

Developing regions throughout Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa have had exposure to blockchain technology since 2017. Charity organizations that use cryptocurrencies are focused on helping people build credit, access loans without a bank account, and receive bitcoin dollars that turn into resources like clean water.

This article is part of Business Insider's ongoing series on Better Capitalism.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

The mysterious nature of bitcoin has led to common misperceptions about its use, with many in the mainstream relegating it to the realm of hackers and gamers.

The history of cryptocurrency shows quite a different purpose: Bitcoin was actually created with the intention of bridging the global wealth gap. The domain name ""bitcoin.org"" was registered online in the midst of the Great Recession of 2008. Soon after, the mysterious and purported creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, released statements explaining the electronic cash-to-cash system was developed as a means to fight centralized currency manipulation.

Nevertheless, wealth inequality has become so drastic that many in the lower and middle classes can't afford to own bitcoin dollars. Inequality in the US has reached a record high since the US Census started tracking it five decades ago, with the federal data showing evidence of a shrinking middle class.

Though the global economy continues to face substantial pressures, experts say the growing popularity of bitcoin might help return it to its intended use: fighting income inequality.

How bitcoin is helping to strengthen the middle class

What's unique about bitcoin is that it functions on another network, one that's a lot more transparent than a corporate bank. Every bitcoin transaction is always recorded in its public archive — the blockchain.

Blockchain is the record of all exchanging cryptocurrencies, essentially digital money, between two parties. It is an independent, shared encrypted database of money entries — think of it as a shared Google Doc. Bitcoin is one type of cryptocurrency among others like litecoin, ethereum, and ripple.

Mark Yusko, the CEO and CIO of investment advisory company Morgan Creek Capital Management, told Business Insider that he believes the blockchain network and its fundamental growth can be leveraged to alleviate income inequality. Yusko is known to be a longtime cryptocurrency bull, drawing investors toward more exposure with bitcoin.

""The government and the elites want to have all the wealth, so they manufacture inflation and the wealth flows to the top,"" he said. ""And that's why we have the greatest wealth inequality in the history of mankind. Bitcoin helps solve that because now we can opt out as an owner of assets from that fiat system.""

The hedge-fund chief explained one of the main economic problems Americans face today is not owning any or enough assets like real estate property and stocks. Not having money to invest in markets and living from paycheck to paycheck is a major setback for the poor and middle class.

There are more opportunities to acquire assets through blockchain technology. For instance, bitcoin is now accepted in some real estate markets, where investors can own parts of a building if they can't afford the whole unit, reports CNBC. This new business model can help distribute wealth and widen the investor demographic. It can also open possibilities of owning property across international borders.

Introducing financial literacy in developing countries

While encouraging people to own assets is a way to fight income inequality in the US, developing countries need a different game plan.

As more people around the world own smartphones, bitcoin has the potential to reach even more users in the 2020s. Because cryptocurrency is only transferred electronically, having the most basic internet connection immediately helps anyone access and trade the currency.

Attention toward expanding the crypto space in developing countries first emerged in 2017, when fintech expert Anton Dzyatkovsky cofounded MicroMoney, a money-lending app targeting Southeast Asian countries like Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines that provides services to help people build a credit history on the blockchain. There are 1.7 billion people around the world who don't have bank accounts and can't access loads, according to The World Bank. Bitcoin has the potential to reach this demographic and provide those financial services.

""We are proud of the fact that we can help people who have no access to the classical, but outdated centralized economy of the bank,"" Dzyatkovsky told Business Insider.

Cryptocurrency is also making a breakthrough in Latin America, Business Insider reports. In 2018, the Venezuelan government devalued its currency by 95% due to hyperinflation, prompting more than 400,000 Venezuelans to flee from the economic collapse. After the government issued a new cryptocurrency called petro, the fleeing citizens were able to make cross-border transactions without relying on paper money. The petro is still used in 2019.

In another case in 2017, an anonymous bitcoin millionaire going by the alias ""Pine"" committed $5 million worth of bitcoin donations to GiveDirectly, an organization that's running the world's largest basic income experiment in Kenyan villages. The bitcoin dollars went toward giving people access to clean water and sending money directly to people living in poverty who are facing food shortage, school fees, and home repairs.

""If this money were to be given to everybody, this would be a very good thing,"" Edwin Odongo Anyango, a 30-year-old day laborer at one of the Kenyan villages, told Business Insider. ""What this money does is it creates hope. And when people have hope, they are happy.""",2019-12-20,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/12/155491-hong-kong-crypto-exchange-coinex-receives-operating-license-in-estonia/,"CoinEx, a global and professional cryptocurrency exchange service provider, announced on Friday it received an operating license from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).

The Crypto-Currency Act of 2020 sets out which Federal agencies should regulate each type of crypto assets.

Three flavors of crypto asset

One of the key things that the draft bill does is define three types of crypto asset; crypto commodities, crypto currencies, and crypto securities, per a discussion draft of the proposed bill.

Crypto-commodities are defined as economic goods or services, stored on a blockchain, with fungibility and which the market treats with no regard as to who produced it.

Crypto-currencies are defined as representations of U.S. currency or synthetic derivatives resting on a blockchain. This covers reserve-backed stablecoins, and currencies determined by decentralized oracles or smart contracts.

Crypto-securities cover all debt, equity and derivative instruments on a blockchain, other than those which are operated and registered as complaint money services businesses.

Not ‘One Federal Crypto Regulator’ to rule them all

Each type of crypto-asset would fall under the jurisdiction of a different regulatory body, to act as the ‘Federal Crypto Regulator’ or ‘Federal Digital Asset Regulator’ for that type.

As might be expected, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) would be the agency in charge of crypto-commodities, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would cover crypto-securities.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) would then be left to regulate crypto-currencies.

Uncertainty currently stifling innovation

While it remains to be seen how far the bill progresses, it is likely to receive support from the cryptocurrency industry which has been calling for regulatory clarity for some time.

As Cointelegraph reported, the EU’s Fifth Anti Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) is set to come into force on Jan. 10, 2020, bringing regulatory clarity to the industry on the other side of the Atlantic.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/coincasso-launches-worldwide-crypto-christmas-challenge/,"CoinCasso Launches Worldwide Crypto Christmas Challenge

Crypto research group Coin Metrics recently released issue 30 of its “State of the Network” series, which ranks crypto assets by auditability. Taking into account node operation, synchronization, normal operation, code audit and extraction of ledger data, the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap were ranked. These were also ranked on ease of ledger reconstruction, and in both categories bitcoin cash emerged as a top-ranked, grade A crypto.

Methodology

Released on Tuesday, the Coin Metrics report goes into great detail describing the methodology for its rankings. “As well as running nodes for most major crypto assets, we also extract raw blockchain data from them to rebuild the asset’s ledger independently. This allows us to compute many of our metrics (for example, realized capitalization) but also to more deeply analyze each asset,” the post details.

Rating node operation, synchronization, normal operation, auditability of code, and extractability of ledger data, Coin Metrics ranks the top ten market cap cryptos on their overall soundness and transparency. For example, citing the Binance chain’s code the report reads: “In that dimension, of the more than 35 unique nodes that Coin Metrics manages, one is unique: Binance Chain. It’s the only one whose source code is not available: only signed binaries are provided to would-be node maintainers.”

Regarding difficulty of synchronization and EOS, it is noted that “synchronizing a full archive EOS node took more than one month and required a machine with terabytes of NVMe SSDs, some of the fastest storage available.”

Bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin and bitcoin SV all received an A rating with the aforementioned auditability dimensions considered. Ethereum got a B “Since historical ledger auditing for ethereum requires a node with tracing and they take a long time to synchronize.” As for tether, the Omni Layer it utilizes was found by Coin Metrics to have “many different ways to credit and debit native units, each accessible through its own API endpoint,” resulting in complications.

“Despite having a very clean accounting model for an asset of its complexity, EOS gets an F due to the complexity of extracting all the necessary data to run a complete audit,” the report reads. When it came to Binance, they struck out on two counts: a “complex fee schedule for its DEX” and closed source code for the same which “makes reverse engineering this schedule very hard.”

Ledger Reconstruction Rankings

The second major evaluation of the Coin Metrics report focuses on ledger reconstruction. With the nodes synchronized, auditors can then rebuild the various ledgers. “The way this is accomplished depends on the asset’s accounting model: UTXO-based (like Bitcoin and its derivatives) or account-based (Ethereum and many others),” the report notes.

Some idiosyncrasies and important notes are made regarding how supply is determined. Where bitcoin is concerned, OP_Return outputs and the genesis block’s output are not counted. Regarding Ethereum, the report clarifies that “Account-based transactions, especially smart contract invocations, only describe the intent of the user, not its effects on the ledger. To be able to recover their impact on the ledger, nodes often need to be run with what is often called ‘tracing’.”

Also noted by the report are the difficulties arising with implicit block rewards and implicit ledger edits which are not an issue for most UTXO cryptos — as the reward amount is clearly seen in each block — but can present problems for account-based assets like ethereum.

“Ripple and Stellar are not graded as we do not reconstruct their ledger completely independently as we rely on APIs provided by third parties,” Coin Metrics notes. Their report continues:

Bitcoin and its derivatives (Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, BSV) receive an A as tracking their UTXO set is a simple task.

Omni gets a B this time due to multiple “ways to move native units which makes it harder to track.” EOS gets a B due to its large scale, which makes auditing difficult. “For Ethereum, the current state of the tools we use don’t allow a full reconstruction of the ledger only using the data exposed by tracing, the changes made in the DAO hard fork have to be manually implemented. It therefore receives a C,” Coin Metrics details. Binance chain once again got an F thanks to a lack of source code and its highly complex DEX.

Keep it Simple

The Coin Metrics report concludes with a statement on validating supply, and notes: “This category doesn’t have a ranking as it’s binary: either we can validate the supply or we can’t due to being unable to reconstruct its ledger. There’s been no case of an asset for which we couldn’t determine what the expected supply should be. A few assets’ nodes let users query what the actual supply is (most notably Bitcoin and its derivatives) which makes this task easy.”

Coin Metrics further clarifies that their rankings are not necessarily reflections on the various protocols themselves, but are also affected by the “nodes and tooling available to users.” In any case, networks like Bitcoin Cash which are easily auditable, straightforward and simple to interact with foster market confidence, and make keeping things decentralized and secure by running one’s own node a readily available option.

Given the great benefits offered by crypto exchanges, direct peer-to-peer transactions are still less popular, especially among traders.

Over the years, crypto exchanges not only converted cryptos but also became custodians and even lenders by offering funds for margin trading. Trading on such platforms became convenient, but what about their security? Many traders entrust their funds to crypto exchanges, which use both hot and cold wallets. However, the threat of hacking attacks has always been relevant even with the most reputable platforms.

Crypto hacking attacks don’t go away

Ironically, the prefix of the term “cryptocurrency” was meant to show how secure the transactions and crypto operations are supposed to be. The origin of “crypto” is from the Greek word “kruptos,” which means hidden or secret. In fact, a “cryptocurrency” is nothing else than a digital currency built on a cryptographic system. So, how is it that we constantly hear about crypto exchanges being successfully hacked?

Well, most cryptocurrencies are secure indeed, given that they rely on distributed ledger technology — an umbrella term that comprises blockchain. However, holding private keys is more challenging, as digital wallets — whether hot or cold — go beyond a blockchain’s horizon.

Large crypto exchanges are attacked by hackers on a constant basis because of obvious reasons. Exchanges like Binance, Bithumb and Coincheck have been successfully hacked in the last two years alone.

At the end of November 2019, South Korean exchange Upbit reported that it had lost 342,000 Ether in a hack, which worth $49 million at the time. The company was forced to suspend all functions for about two weeks. The “irregular withdrawal” happened when Upbit was moving all crypto funds from hot to cold wallets for security reasons.

Year-to-date, the total volume of crypto-related fraud and theft resulted in losses worth $4.4 billion, according to CipherTrace’s report for the third quarter of 2019.

The most common types of attacks on crypto exchanges include using social engineering, DDoS attacks and injecting malicious code through malware. Besides these hacking methods, some attacks may be the result of an inside job.

The most popular social engineering scheme is phishing. Crypto holders are tricked into believing that they are dealing with a genuine crypto service, while in fact they are handing their personal data and private keys over to hackers. This is why it’s important to make sure you’re doing business with a real crypto exchange rather than its clones.

DDoS attacks are malicious attempts to attack a crypto exchange’s server or network by directing an overwhelming flood of internet traffic to it.

Can an exchange impenetrable for hackers be built?

The security of large crypto exchanges has evolved to the point that there are very few points of failures — but they still exist. At this point, no crypto exchange that stores client funds can claim that it’s unhackable.

Still, there are exchanges that can brag about their success in beating hacking attacks since their foundation. The best example of this is HitBTC, which was established in 2013. Notably, it is one of the oldest crypto exchanges out there, which makes its history even more relevant. The platform applies advanced encryption technology, relies on cold storage, and encourages users to enable the two-factor authentication and whitelist withdrawals. These measures help HitBTC ensure a high degree of security.

HitBTC has managed to attract many crypto traders, becoming one of the largest spot trading exchanges — with over 800 trading pairs and over 500 digital assets.

In an article about social engineering scams, HitBTC explained:

“There are hundreds if not thousands of scammers out there trying to impersonate our employees and steal funds from our traders.”

Thus, all crypto exchanges are exposed to potential hacking attacks — there is no way to avoid them. However, some crypto exchange services claim that they have no single point of failure, as they don’t hold clients’ crypto funds. These are so-called decentralized crypto exchanges. If they reside on a secure blockchain network, then they’re most likely to never be hacked.

All in all, the security of most crypto exchange is far from being infallible, as the cryptocurrency market is still struggling with regular threats from hackers. However, this is also true of any other market, as many governments, banks and corporations are targeted by hackers as well.

The firm’s head of research Lawrence Lundy—which has invested in major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, Brave, and Chainlink—said that the next ten years will be about deployment, if the last decade was primarily about installment.

In an end-of-the-year report entitled “18 Predictions for 2020,” Lundy identified key trends in bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchain that would set the tone for the start of the deployment phase.

Trends of bitcoin

For major cryptocurrencies, scalability has always been the biggest issue as the demand for digital assets and blockchain usage increased.

Most blockchain developers generally agree that over the long-term, a second-layer settlement network on top of existing blockchains is crucial for growth.

Beginning 2020, the report suggested that the second-layer usage of bitcoin will see more light. Since its inception in 2009, bitcoin has been recognized as a store-of-value more than a payment settlement network.

With Lightning and other potential layer two solutions, Lundy said that bitcoin will increasingly be seen as an open financial platform.

“But the growth of LApps (Lightning Apps) and more broadly data anchoring will be a stronger fundamental signal of the development of a fee market and the long-term viability of Bitcoin,” read the report.

Trends of Ethereum

It is hardly any surprise but Outlier Ventures expect decentralized finance (DeFi) to continue to be the main narrative around Ethereum in the coming years.

In 2019, DeFi on Ethereum has seen explosive growth. Based on the data from DeFiPulse, the total value locked in DeFi platforms reached $661 million, the overwhelming majority coming from Ethereum.

Specifically, Ethereum’s largest DeFi platform Maker accounts for $329 million of the $661 million, and Ethereum is used as the main collateral for most DeFi applications.

Lundy noted:

“With Istanbul now live, we expect EIP-2028 to have a major impact on layer 2 adoption opening up use cases beyond crowdfunding and DeFi. Expect to see games currently using EOS and Tron to migrate over to Ethereum to take advantage of the DeFi lego available.”

Trends of Blockchain

In the area of blockchain, the report says that central bank-backed digital currencies will see significant progress with the lead of China.

On October 25, Chinese President Xi Jinping formally encouraged the development of blockchain and blockchain-related platforms while distancing from crypto.

Since then, as reported by NewsBTC, major industry executives have said that the reputation of the blockchain industry noticeably improved.

“In 2020, we expect this to be how the Chinese Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP) launches with licenses given to select exchanges and dominant platforms as distribution platforms to hundreds of millions of users like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent,” suggested the report.

Following China, France and other nations have signaled interest in developing government-owned digital currencies. There are expectations that South Korea is likely to be next with the hiring of a cryptocurrency specialist by the Bank of Korea.

Regulatory pressures as well as the development of third-party, intermediary and custodial services in the crypto space have been limiting the share of peer-to-peer trading. A new contender is now challenging established P2P exchanges by offering users a mobile service that allows them to determine the level of privacy they want to maintain, and use multiple payment methods including cash.

Peer-to-Peer Exchange on the Go

Tandem is a crypto startup recognizing that the long-term success of cryptocurrencies depends on mass adoption. And while bitcoin awareness has been increasing since 2009, the company’s team remarks in a blog post on Medium, “it is still only known, trusted, and accessible to less than 1% of the global population.”

The platform hopes to support the adoption of decentralized money by combining the best principles of the crypto space and traditional finance. It has recently launched an application that allows users to buy and sell coins on a peer-to-peer basis and on the go. Noting that Tandem’s goal is to encourage adoption across diverse geographies, the company’s founder Prashanth Swaminathan stated that widespread adoption is part of his company’s long-term vision.

The focus has been placed on providing traders in over 50 countries at launch — and more than 100 nations and regions in mind for the future — with a mobile product when the leading platforms in the niche, such as Localbitcoins, Paxful, and Hodlhodl are desktop-based. The app, which is already available in beta on the Apple App Store and Google Play, offers an accessible and feature-rich interface.

The Tandem P2P application enables traders to exchange traditional currency to and from cryptocurrency. They can publish ads where they offer to buy or sell crypto. The “no advertising fee” policy maintained by the platform allows you to create multiple orders. Trades are conducted directly between the users of the service while Tandem acts only as an escrow provider, not a custodian.

Tandem Supports In-Person Cash Trades

When two sides agree on a trade, they can either complete it entirely online or meet to exchange the digital coins for paper cash, something that has become harder to do via established P2P platforms. The Helsinki-based Localbitcoins, for example, removed in-person cash trades this summer. Since June, when the option was dropped, those who prefer this type of deal have been opting for alternatives such as local.Bitcoin.com, which offers people around the world the opportunity to trade bitcoin cash (BCH) locally using cash or a wide variety of online payment methods.

Tandem now puts forward a mobile alternative to the incumbents. A survey conducted by the startup showed that at least 60% of the polled P2P traders wanted to switch to a mobile application, with almost 70% of the respondents stating they were trading digital assets on a daily basis. The Tandem app starts with providing 28 fiat options to buy and sell bitcoin core (BTC) but it plans to soon expand the list of supported cryptocurrencies. As CEO Prashanth Swaminathan remarked:

Cryptocurrency is primarily known today as an investment vehicle for the rich. Over the course of time, we at Tandem would like to change this narrative to benefit other sections of the society within multiple nations.

Another feature that distinguishes the new P2P platform is that it allows you to set the level of privacy you want to have. Its KYC Level 1 requires only an email verification but it comes with a 1 BTC daily transaction limit, 0.3% maker fee and 0.6% taker fee, while those who prefer to have unlimited access and lower fees can switch to Level 2 after passing photo ID verification. These traders will also enjoy lower maker (0%) and taker (0.2%) fees. The mobile P2P exchange allows trades for as little as $10.

At a summit attended by leaders of Muslim countries, including Malaysia, Turkey, Iran, Qatar, and Indonesia, the Iranian president proposed creating a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar. The Malaysian prime minister supports the idea of a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries.

Unified Muslim Cryptocurrency

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the prospect of creating a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries on Thursday. The discussion took place at the “Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019,” a four-day event which started on Wednesday.

Leaders from countries such as Malaysia, Turkey, Iran, Qatar, and Indonesia attended the summit. They aim to “discuss and find new solutions to problems facing the Muslim world as well as to improve the wellbeing of Muslims and Muslim countries in general,” the official website of the Prime Minister’s Office of Malaysia describes.

The leaders of Malaysia, Turkey, and Iran spoke at a roundtable session on Thursday where the subject of cryptocurrency was discussed, the Associated Press reported, adding:

Rouhani proposed an Islamic financial payment with Muslim countries trading in local currencies and the creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar and weather the effects of market fluctuation.

He also urged Muslim nations “to deepen financial and trade cooperation to fight what he described as U.S. economic hegemony,” the news outlet conveyed. “The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime,” he was quoted as saying. The U.S. currently has sanctions against Iran. In addition, a Senate committee approved a bill last week to impose sanctions on Turkey.

Rouhani also talked about how rising extremism, coupled with other challenges such as weak governance, poverty, and corruption, are endangering sovereignty and paving the way for Western interference in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and other Muslim nations.

Malaysian Prime Minister’s Response to Muslim Crypto Proposal

After the roundtable session, the Malaysian prime minister was asked by the media about his response to Rouhani’s suggestion of a unified Muslim cryptocurrency. According to Bernama, the Malaysian government’s news agency:

Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir said he is open to the idea of a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries.

“It is the first time we hear Iran and also Turkey are of the opinion that if we do not have American dollars, we can use our own currency or one common currency that we (Muslim nations) can create if we agree,” the prime minister was quoted as saying. “Malaysia had mooted the idea of a common currency for Islamic nations a long time ago, but the big powers had then stood in the way of that proposal … This is because when their currencies are used by others, it gave them added strength,” he elaborated. The prime minister further said that Malaysia is willing to work with Iran and Turkey in technological fields as it is much more advanced in these areas than other Muslim countries.

The rhymes of the history.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/bybit-ceo-ben-zhou-on-crypto-derivatives-and-market-predictions-for-2020/,"Bybit CEO Ben Zhou on Crypto Derivatives and Market Predictions for 2020

12 months ago, crypto derivatives platform Bybit officially launched. The Singapore exchange, which also has offices in Hong Kong and Taiwan, has enjoyed a fruitful first year, attracting users from North America, Europe, Russia and Asia. With products including BTC, ETH, XRP and EOS perpetual contracts, and a matching engine capable of handling 100,000 tps, Bybit is looking to carry its success into 2020 and beyond. CEO Ben Zhou spoke to news.Bitcoin.com about its successes, challenges, and aspirations.

Building a Thriving Exchange Bit by Bit

Although 2019 will go down as a successful year for Bybit according to Ben Zhou, is has not been all plain sailing up to this point. While undoubtedly a cause for celebration, a growing user base presents its own difficulties – particularly since Bybit prides itself on no overloads or downtime, plus round-the-clock multilingual customer support.

“Keeping up with the growth both from a technical standpoint and internal management is the biggest challenge that we have faced,” admits Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit. “Because we’ve experienced over 100x growth from March ’18 to November ’19, we have had to constantly upgrade our systems to make sure we have no overloads and system lags.

“We’ve also had to stay on top of recruitment, sourcing the right talent to make sure we provide the best customer support and localization to our various markets. Thankfully, our efforts have paid off: we haven’t had any server downtimes, no overloads during volatility and low latency trading.”

New Frontiers in a Highly Competitive Market

In a bid to attract yet more day traders to its platform, Bybit has recently added Korean as a supported language, with English, Chinese, traditional Chinese and Japanese already in place. This internationalist outlook is very much at the heart of the business, which is looking to expand into new foreign markets in the New Year.

“We’re planning to move into the Thai, Vietnamese and Spanish markets as well as Turkey in 2020,” says Zhou, who spent seven years managing the Greater China region at Forex brokers XM before launching Bybit. It’s experience which makes his view on China’s attitude towards blockchain all the more interesting. In October, President Xi said the country had to “seize the opportunities” presented by blockchain. And that’s exactly what it appears to be doing, with over 500 blockchain projects already registered with the government.

“China is going full force with blockchain technology and will soon openly embrace the technology in many public channels,” Zhou predicts. “At the same time, the government is cracking down on illegal ICOs and scams, which is a positive thing for the whole space in China. The purge will get rid of the scam projects and leave the ones that are actually contributing to the space.

“Bybit has never had an ICO and doesn’t accept any fiat currency. We also banned Chinese IPs in compliance with the government until we get clear indicators that the laws and regulations have changed.”

Decentralization and Derivatives

If 2019 was the year of defi lending, 2020 could well be the year of defi derivatives. The Synthetix protocol has already gained traction, being described as a decentralized iteration of the popular derivatives exchange BitMex. Does Zhou see decentralization as a path Bybit may go down?

“We plan to commission our research team to delve into blockchain technology and brainstorm how we may apply it to the derivatives market. This is an exciting new initiative that could bring about some really novel changes. The team will conduct in-depth market analysis and report on the whole industry to provide more value to the space. Who knows, we might even decentralize part of the exchange or wallet to start with.”

Taking such steps could be a necessity rather than a luxury; while the crypto derivatives market is still relatively new, it is heating up. Binance recently took an equity stake in FTX exchange, having acquired JEX back in September. Huobi and Okex are also looking to cement their positions in the market. In the year to come, Zhou intends to add functionality and promote education to ensure Bybit stands out from the crowd.

What’s in Store for 2020?

“One of the main things we are excited about pushing in the first quarter of 2020 is a linear contract. That would be in addition to our current inverse trading contracts. The linear contracts will be settled in USDT with portfolio margin functionalities to allow full account-wide usage of the available margin, and allow users to utilize the unrealized PnL as margin for more positions.

“On top of this, we’ll also offer the ability to hedge within the position area. So instead of merging the long and short as is the case with our inverse contract, we’ll separate the long and short positions and allow traders to have both at the same time.”

Although blogs about crypto derivatives are easy to come across, Zhou says full-fledged educational resources don’t exist – and it’s an oversight he intends to rectify.

“Honestly, I haven’t seen any systematic programs that focus on derivatives traders from Beginner to Advanced, and this is something we’d like to offer our traders so that everyone has the opportunity to learn and grow.

“We’ll soon be launching a space where expert traders, thought leaders or just savvy crypto enthusiasts can share and educate fellow traders in one space. In the long term, we want to create value for our traders beyond just trading, and we hope to create a community that is actively engaging and educating one another.”

Audacious predictions are par for the course in the crypto space, but given the many famous fails we’ve witnessed in the past decade, the focus for CEOs like Zhou must be on getting the basics right: growing their user base, keeping funds and data safe and providing outstanding customer service. This is something he appears to acknowledge, while issuing solid predictions for the coming year:

BTC will once again be the strongest in 2020, whereas altcoins will continue to rely on BTC’s price stability to see any significant growth. Tokenized securities will need a massive breakthrough if they are to live up to the hype while shitcoins will continue to fade into oblivion. Ultimately, I am very bullish about crypto in the long run.

In times of mounting pressure on crypto companies to comply with expanding due diligence requirements, Poloniex has taken a step in the opposite direction. The exchange is lifting restrictions that applied to unverified users in response to customer demand. New and current accounts will enjoy access to unlimited trading and deposits.

Access for Email-Only Accounts

Over the next few months, the current accounts of unverified customers will be unfrozen and upgraded to Level 1 accounts, the platform announced in a tweet this week. These users will have access to unlimited spot trading and deposits, while withdrawals will be restricted to a daily maximum of $10,000. Starting now, all new customers can create an account using only an email address and password and begin trading, Poloniex revealed in a blog post on the matter, stating:

We’ve heard your feedback time and time again about wanting to use Poloniex without giving up your identity. We’ve wanted to make this a reality for a while now and are sorry it has taken us longer than we’d like.

The new account tier means that anyone who signs up for the exchange from now on will be able to start trading immediately and already existing accounts of unverified users will be gradually upgraded to Level 1. “We know how frustrating your experience has been recently and we’re dedicated to improving that for you,” Poloniex emphasizes, addressing its long-time clients. “We are striving to provide the highest level of support and security possible for customers and appreciate your patience,” the exchange adds, advising customers to activate two-factor authentication as well.

Swimming Against the Tide

Traders with unverified accounts will enjoy some additional benefits. For example, they will be able to participate in competitions, take advantage of staking services and gain access to Trollbox, the platform’s forum for traders. Level 1 users can also buy cryptocurrency with bank cards. The exchange currently supports dozens of digital coins including leading currencies such as bitcoin core (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ethereum (ETH), and litecoin (LTC) as well as new cryptos like the Mimblewimble-based grin.

Poloniex’s move comes amid a global trend towards implementing stricter know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) rules in the crypto space which has been traditionally quite sensitive to privacy infringement. Governments around the world have been introducing more stringent regulations to comply with the crypto standards adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the provisions of the European Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5).

These developments have forced established platforms in the industry to change their policies requiring clients to provide detailed personal information and pass extensive verification procedures. Poloniex restores access for unverified accounts after its separation from Circle which bought the trading platform in early 2018. The formerly U.S.-based digital asset exchange was reportedly acquired by an Asian investment group and is now operated by the Seychelles-registered company Polo Digital Assets Ltd. On Nov. 1, the platform terminated trading services for customers residing in the United States.

Just.game has been dubbed “a showcase of how blockchain technology can be used to create an autonomous company that constantly generates revenue and distributes it to anyone crazy enough to play with it.” In other words, it’s Fomo3D on steroids.

Fomo3D Is Reborn With Added AI and Bigger Buzzwords

Accompanied by a 59-page whitepaper explaining its game theory, it’s safe to say Just.game isn’t just another blockchain game. Like previous releases by the meme lords at Team Just, Just.game promises to combine highly addictive rewards mechanisms with just enough randomicity to keep players returning regularly for their dopamine fix. Loot boxes, crowd psychology, and puzzling paradoxes are all thrown into the mix with Just.game, which launches on December 22.

Although Ethereum’s dapp ecosystem rose 118% this year, with daily value surging 166%, Team Just have opted to build Just.game on Tron due to its better scalability and higher throughput. This is not another greed-is-good lottery game, though: Just.game uses what its creators call “autodecentric technology” and aligns economic incentives, crowd power, and lateral thinking.

Game-Changing Gambling Dapps

In essence, Just.game provides financial incentives for users who help its AI, known as CURVY, accomplish “her” goals. These incentives can include bonuses distributed to the last 100 participants before the game’s timer reaches zero, and opportunities for investment in speculative assets that can only rise in value. Players who are unable to cash out at the top should at least learn a thing or two about autodecentric (aka self-decentralizing) infrastructure, AI and gamified economics.

Although runaway successes such as Fomo3D and Exitscam.me make interesting case studies for anthropologists – and have more than a few things to teach about human avarice – there’s no denying the clever mechanisms built in which have broader applications for tokenized systems. Leaving the philosophical insights to the academics, here’s a retrospective of two dapps that had the crypto world salivating.

Crypto Dapps That Became Cause Célèbres

It’s been a couple of years since Cryptokitties launched on Ethereum, but it’s fair to say the effects of its success still resonate. After all, this was when the cryptosphere learned that a dapp’s popularity could threaten to actually bring down a blockchain. Cryptokitties was everywhere in December 2017, a disarmingly simple yet addictive game wherein users bred, collected and traded quirky digital kittens – some commanding six-figure price tags.

At one stage, the dapp’s popularity was such that it accounted for almost 11% of all traffic on the Ethereum network, leading many to speculate that the blockchain could grind to a halt. Thankfully, a crack team of developers from projects such as Metamask and Grid+ were dispatched to ease the burden on the network, introducing measures such as a transactional queue, indicators and a button that would let users resubmit their transaction with higher gas prices. The crypto world breathed a collective sigh – then returned to breeding cute kitties.

Gambling dapp Fomo3D was another crazily addictive entry to the space, one whose appeal also succeeding in slowing the Ethereum network to a crawl. The goal of the game was to purchase the last key before the timer reached zero, whereupon you could win a veritable treasure chest of ether. A heady blend of game theory, mathematics and psychology compelled endless gamers to rek themselves chasing its bounty, with 150,000 Ethereum transactions recorded a day at the title’s peak. Last August a lucky punter hit pay dirt, scooping 10,469 ETH – just shy of $3 million at the time.

Shameless Ponzis that preyed upon the greed of users? You be the judge. Whatever the case, these dapps got gamers’ all fired up, prompting them to frantically empty their wallets like there was no tomorrow. Just.game looks set to continue that tradition. In the words of its creators, “Just.game should be treated with the same caution as you would an emotionally manipulative human partner. The A.I accomplishes many of its goals by creating emotions for you, it’ll show you love and adoration, then scare you into action, and eventually might even break your heart.”

As Ethereum nodes kept falling over the course of 2019, nodes in Bitcoin’s network continued to grow.

As per Trustnodes, Ethereum’s network was the largest when it came to the number of nodes, and the blockchain dominated the industry in terms of size. However, the number started falling in 2019, currently being down by around 3,000 since the start of the year.

Almost half of the lost nodes were shut down since Ethereum’s December hard fork, which is quite a sudden change for its blockchain. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s nodes kept rising throughout the year.

Bitcoin even managed to overtake Ethereum at one point earlier this year, when it had around 10,266 nodes, while Ethereum’s high point in 2019 was only at 10,078 nodes. However, according to a report published by Bitcoinist back in May of this year, Bitcoin never had ‘only’ 10,000 nodes. Instead, its network surpassed 100,000 around the time the report was published.

This would indicate that Ethereum was never even close to BTC, provided that these calculations are true.

However, that still doesn’t change the fact that Ethereum’s nodes were, indeed, falling at a rapid rate throughout the year, and especially in December. At its lowest point, ETH hit 6.500 nodes, although this was soon followed by a recovery that has recently brought it back to around 7,000.

Why is Ethereum Losing Nodes?

The sharp drop in ETH nodes was surrounded with speculation for quite some time, with many assuming that it may have something to do with lower interest in the project. After all, Ethereum’s price has been falling for the last six months, just like Bitcoin’s. However, ETH’s maintenance upgrades might also be responsible, as the project had to cut off quite a few of them to go through with those upgrades.

This drop was the most obvious a few weeks ago, when the project hard forked in order to add some gas fee efficiencies. Meanwhile, any node that failed to upgrade properly got cut off from the network, costing ETH around 1,500 nodes in the process.

This is not the worst part for Ethereum, however, as the project is bound to see another hard fork in the near future in order for it to delay its difficulty bomb for another two years. This means that in less than two weeks — the project will likely lose another wave of nodes that fail to upgrade.

Why is This not the Case with Bitcoin?

Bitcoin has a different approach, and it gives nodes the ability to choose whether or not they wish to upgrade. If the nature of the upgrade doesn’t give the nodes a choice, the blockchain simply doesn’t implement it.

According to some reports, Bitcoin used to have only 5,000 nodes, which changed during the bull run of 2017. The increased adoption started bringing new nodes to the blockchain, and it never really stopped.

Ethereum, on the other hand, had 25,000 nodes back in 2017, while now, two years later, it has nodes somewhere between 7,000 and 7,500. There are plenty of similarities between the two networks — both of them run at 1MB per 10 minutes (although bitcoin’s node capacity can go to 2MB), and both have similar spread.

Some estimates claim that Germany is on a sharp rise as a hot spot for nodes within Bitcoin’s networks, likely due to a great undergrounder coders scene.

What do you think about the reducing number of Ethereum nodes? Let us know in the comments below.

One of the most prominent of these predictions has been one from Tim Draper, one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent venture capitalists, having made early investments in companies from Skype and SpaceX to Tesla. Draper, notably, bought his first Bitcoin over five years ago, buying millions of dollars worth of the leading digital asset in an auction held by the U.S. government.

Draper, for over a year now, has been saying that the price of BTC will easily hit $250,000 — over 3,400% higher than the current price of $7,200 — by the end of 2022 or by early 2023.

Bitcoin Prediction Irresponsible, Vays Declares

Tone Vays, a former Wall Street trader turned cryptocurrency analyst, however, says that this prediction is rather irresponsible.

Speaking to industry outlet Block TV in a recent interview, Vays quipped that he believes saying Bitcoin will hit $50,000 in 2023 is “much more responsible than an adult” than Draper’s rhetoric, going on to explain that he thinks the Silicon Valley venture capitalist’s call is more of an attempt to drive clicks and say irrational opinions rather than a based analysis.

Others Still Convinced

While Vays thinks that the call is irresponsible, there is some evidence to suggest that Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by 2023, making the call not that irrational.

Brian Kelly, an investor that focuses on crypto assets and blockchain investments, noted that if you look at BTC’s long-term logarithmic growth channel, the upper bound of that channel, which the asset has been trading in for eight years now, is somewhere in the $200,000 range by 2022-2023. Considering the importance of this channel and the fact that Bitcoin has interacted with it for years implies that technically speaking, the prediction has a fair likelihood of becoming reality.

That’s not to mention the positive effects the Bitcoin halvings should have on the price of the cryptocurrency. In six months’ time, the number of BTC issued per block will get cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25, marking a negative supply shock for this nascent market.

PlanB, a pseudonymous quantitative analyst, notes that this should give Bitcoin a fair value of at least $55,000, per his statistical model, accurate to an R squared of 95% — very accurate in statistics lingo. The thing is, Bitcoin often outperforms the model by hundreds of percent, making $250,000 by 2023 entirely feasible by historical standards.

HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China may debut the breakout fintech innovation of 2020. Beijing is primed to launch the world’s first digital sovereign currency. The initial roll out looks cautious, focusing on consumer spending. Deploying the new technology more widely in the country’s banking system could be the disruptive next step.

A 2019 survey from the Bank of International Settlements found that 70% of the world’s major monetary authorities are studying their own digital versions of money. The People’s Bank of China, worried about private alternatives like Facebook’s Libra and Bitcoin, is likely to be the first major economy to launch its own.

Details are scarce, but Mu Changchun, the head of the PBOC’s digital currency research institute, hinted in November that an “e-yuan” will be distributed via commercial banks, Tencent, and Alibaba-backed Ant Financial, national giants of online payments. Mobile wallet users will hardly notice the difference.

But the underlying distributed ledger technology - essentially, a shared database that is constantly synchronised by a network of computers - would give authorities unprecedented ability to track and monitor online spending flows. That could arm watchdogs with a powerful tool against fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.

Using digital currency in wholesale financial markets would make interbank settlements and other transactions more efficient and secure. Putting it to work in the more backwards corners of China’s financial system could also aid efforts to clean up 2.4 trillion yuan ($341 billion) of officially recognised bad debt.

One of China’s biggest problems, for example, is the illegal but widespread practice of pledging the same asset - bonds, deposit certificates, and shares - as collateral for multiple loans. Distributed ledgers could be more effective at detecting this practice than traditional databases used elsewhere. Many local businesses also still trade so-called discounted banker’s acceptance notes as cash-in-kind. Digitising these pieces of paper would also reduce fraud risk.

Rushing into the initiative would be risky but with President Xi Jinping backing blockchain, officials will have to deliver something. The PBOC will become China’s next fintech star.

Scott Army is the founder and CEO of digital asset manager Vision Hill Group. The following is a summary of the report: “An Institutional Take on the 2019/2020 Digital Asset Market.”

No. 1: There’s bitcoin, and then there’s everything else.

The industry is currently segmented into two main categories: bitcoin and everything else. “Everything else” includes: Web3 innovation, Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”), Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, smart contract platforms, security tokens, digital identity, data privacy, gaming, enterprise blockchain or distributed ledger technology, and much more.

Non-crypto natives are seldom aware there are multiple blockchains. Bitcoin, by virtue of it being the first blockchain network brought into the mainstream and by being the largest digital asset by market capitalization, is often the first stop for many newcomers and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

No. 2: Bitcoin is perhaps market beta, for now.

In traditional equity markets, beta is defined as a measure of volatility, or unsystematic risk an individual stock possesses relative to the systematic risk of the market as a whole. The difficulty in defining “market beta” in a space like digital assets is that there is no consensus for a market proxy like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones. Since the space is still very early in its development, and bitcoin has dominant market share (~68 percent at the time of writing), bitcoin is often viewed as the obvious choice for beta, despite the drawbacks of defining “market beta” as a single asset with idiosyncratic tendencies.

Bitcoin’s

size and its institutionalization (futures, options, custody, and clear

regulatory status as a commodity), have enabled it to be an attractive first

step for allocators looking to get exposure (both long and short) to the

digital asset market, suggesting that bitcoin is perhaps positioned to be digital

asset market beta, for now.

No. 3: Despite slow conversion, substantial progress was made on growing institutional investor interest in 2019.

Education,

education, education. Blockchain

technology and digital assets represent an extraordinarily complex asset class

– one that requires a non-trivial time commitment to undergo a proper learning

curve. While handfuls of institutions have already started to invest in the

space, a very small amount of institutional capital has actually made it in

(relative to the broader institutional landscape), gauged by the size of the

asset class and the public market trading volumes. This has led many to

repeatedly ask: “when will the herd actually come?”

The reality is that

institutional investors are still learning – slowly getting comfortable – and

this process will continue to take time. Despite educational progress through 2019, some

institutions are wondering if it’s too early to be investing in this space, and

whether they can potentially get involved in investing in digital assets in the

future and still generate positive returns, but in ways that are de-risked

relative to today.

Despite a few other

challenges imposed on larger institutional allocators with respect to investing

in digital assets, true believers inside these large organizations are

emerging, and the processes for forming a digital asset strategy are either

getting started or already underway.

No. 4: Long simplicity, short complexity

Another trend we

observed emerge this year was a shift away from complexity and toward

simplicity. We saw significant growth in simple,

passive, low-cost structures to capture beta. With the lowest-friction investor

adoption focused on the largest liquid asset in the space – bitcoin – the

proliferation of single asset vehicles has increased. These private vehicles are a result of

delayed approval of an official bitcoin ETF by the SEC.

We also observed a growing

institutional appetite for simpler hedge fund and venture fund structures. For

the last several years, many fundamental-focused crypto-native hedge funds

operated hybrid structures with the use of side-pockets that enabled a barbell

strategy approach to investing in both the public and private digital asset

markets. These hedge funds tend to have

longer lock-up periods – typically two or three years – and low liquidity.

While this may be attractive from an opportunistic perspective, the reality is it’s

quite complicated from an institutional perspective for reporting purposes.

No. 5: Active management has been challenged but differentiated sources of alpha are emerging.

For the year-to-date period ended Q3 2019, active managers were collectively up 30 percent on an absolute return basis according to our tracking of approximately 50 institutional-quality funds, compared to bitcoin being up 122 percent over the same time period.

Bitcoin’s performance this year, particularly in Q2 2019, has made it clear that its parabolic ascents challenge the ability of active managers to outperform bitcoin during the windows they occur. Active managers generally need to justify the fees they charge investors by outperforming their benchmark(s), which are often beta proxies, yet at the same time they need to avoid imprudent risk behavior that can potentially have swift and sizable negative effects on their portfolios.

Interestingly, active management performance from the beginning of 2018 consistently outperformed passively holding bitcoin (with the exception of “opportunistic” managers who also take advantage of yield and staking opportunities, as of May 2019). This is largely due to various risk management techniques used to mitigate the negative performance drawdowns experienced throughout the extended market sell-off in 2018.

Source: Vision Hill Group

Although 2019 has challenged the large-scale

success of these alpha strategies, they are nonetheless in the process of

proving themselves out through various market cycles, and we expect this to be

a growing theme in 2020.

No. 6: Token value accrual: Transitioning from subjective to objective

At the end of Q3 2019, according to dapp.com, there were 1,721 decentralized applications built on top of ethereum, with 604 of them actively used – more than any other blockchain. Ethereum also had 1.8 million total unique users, with just under 400,000 of them active – also more than any other blockchain. Yet, despite all this growing network activity, the value of ETH has remained largely flat throughout most of 2019 and is on track to end the year down approximately 10 percent at the time of writing (by comparison, BTC has nearly doubled in value over the same period). This begs the question: is ETH adequately capturing the economic value of the ethereum network’s activity, and DeFi in particular?

A new fundamental metric was introduced

earlier this year by Chris Burniske – the Network Value to Token

Value (“NVTV”) ratio – to ascertain whether the value of all assets anchored

into a platform can be greater than the value of the base platform’s asset.

The ETH NVTV ratio has steadily declined throughout the last few years. There are likely to be several reasons for this, but I think one theory summarizes it best: most applications and tokens built and issued atop ethereum may be parasitic. ETH token holders are paying for the security of all these applications and tokens, via the inflation rate that is currently given to the miners – dilution for ETH holders, but not for holders of ethereum-based tokens.

This is not a bullish or bearish

statement on ETH; rather it is an observation of early signs of network stack

value capture in the space.

No. 7: Money or not, software-powered collateral economies are here.

Another trend we observed this year is a larger migration away from “cryptocurrencies” in an ideological currency (e.g., money/payment and a means of exchange) sense, and toward digital assets for financial applications and economic utility. A form of economic utility that took the stage this year is the notion of software-powered collateral economies. People generally want to hold assets with disinflationary or deflationary supply curves, because part of their promise is that they should store value well. Smart contracts enable us to program the characteristics of any asset, thus it is not irrational to assume that it’s only a matter of time until traditional collateral assets get digitized and put to economic use on blockchain networks.

The benefit of digital collateral is it can be liquid and economically productive in its nature while at the same time serving its primary purpose (to collateralize another asset), yet without possessing the risks of traditional rehypothecation. If assets can be allocated for multiple purposes simultaneously, with the risks appropriately managed, we should see more liquidity, lower cost of borrowing, and more effective allocation of capital in ways the traditional world may not be able to compete with.

No. 8: Network lifecycles: An established supply side meets a quiet but emerging demand side.

Supply side services in digital asset networks are services provided by a third party to a decentralized network in exchange for compensation allocated by that network. Examples include mining, staking, validation, bonding, curation, node operation and more, done to help bootstrap and grow these networks. Incentivizing the supply side is important in digital assets to facilitate their growth early in their lifecycles, from initial fundraising and distribution through the bootstrapping phase to eventual mainnet launches.

While there has been significant growth of this supply side of the equation in 2019 from funds, companies, and developers, the open question is how and when demand for these services will pick up. Our view is that as developer infrastructure continues to mature and activity begins to move “up the stack” toward the application layer, more obvious manifestations of product-market fit are likely to emerge with cleaner and simpler interfaces that will attract high volumes of users in the process. In essence, it is important to build the necessary infrastructure first (the supply side) to enable buy-in from the end users of those services (the demand side).

No. 9: We are in the late innings of the smart contract wars.

While ethereum leads the space on adoption and moves closer to executing on its scalability initiatives, dozens of smart contract competitors fundraised in the market throughout 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to dethrone ethereum. A handful have formally launched their chains and operate in mainnet as of the end of 2019, while many others remain in testnet or have stalled in development.

What’s

been particularly interesting to observe is the accelerative pace of innovation

– not just technologically, but economically (incentive mechanisms) and

socially (community building) as well.

We expect many more smart contract competitors operating privately as of

Q4 2019 to launch their mainnets in 2020. Thus, given the incoming magnitude of

publicly observable experimentations throughout 2020, if a smart contract

platform does not launch in 2020, it is likely to become disadvantageously

positioned relative to the rest of the landscape as it relates to capturing

substantial developer mindshare and future users and creating defensible

network effects.

No. 10: Product-market fit is coming, if not already here.

We don’t think human and financial capital would have

continued pouring into the digital asset space in such great magnitude over the

last several years if there wasn’t a focus on solving at least one very clear

problem. The questionable sustainability of modern monetary theory is one of

them, and Ray Dalio of Bridgerwater Associates has been quite vocal about it. Big Tech centralization is another. There are also growing

global concerns related to data privacy and identity. And let’s not forget

cybersecurity. The list goes on. We are at the tip of the iceberg as it

relates to the products and applications blockchain technology enables, and mainstream users will come with growing

manifestations of product-market fit. As more time and attention gets spent on

diagnosing problems and working on solutions, the industry will begin to

achieve its full potential. Facebook’s Libra and

Twitter’s Bluesky initiative confirm that as an industry we are heading in the

right direction.

A 2020 look ahead

We see 2020 shaping up to be one of the brightest years on record for the digital asset industry. To be clear, this is not a price forecast; if we exclusively measured the health of the industry from a fundamental progress perspective, by various accounts and measures we should have been in a raging bull market for the last two years, and that has not been the case. Rather, we expect 2020 to be a year of accelerated industry maturation.

According to one researcher, quantum computing faces more hurdles than many realize when it comes to achieving viability in breaking encryption. In a recent report Dr. Subhash Kak, Regents Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oklahoma State University, notes that there are issues such as “noise” and error correction that render the buzz about quantum supremacy when it comes to Bitcoin, still largely theoretical.

Also Read: What Google’s Quantum Breakthrough Means for Blockchain Cryptography

Where Quantum Supremacy Falls Short

In essence “quantum supremacy” refers to the demonstration that a quantum computer can solve some problem classical computers can’t. There’s no doubt this has been done, but the important question for those in the crypto space centers on what kind of problem is being solved. While the development of quantum supremacy is a haunting specter indeed for hodlers worried about their private keys, there’s yet little evidence the problems being solved by this technology have much utility in cracking encryption where cryptos are concerned.

“These companies are trying to build hardware that replicates the circuit model of classical computers. However, current experimental systems have less than 100 qubits. To achieve useful computational performance, you probably need machines with hundreds of thousands of qubits,” states Dr. Subhash Kak in a recent article.

Though groups like D-wave boast 2000 qubits (quantum bits) the applications are different. D-wave’s focus is on optimization via a process called quantum annealing which, according to Kak, is a “narrower approach to quantum computing … where qubits are used to speed up optimization problems.” As such, D-wave’s claims have garnered some criticism, with one recent report on the topic calling the D-wave system “skim milk” compared to other computers.

Noise and Error Correction

The real difficulty in achieving practical quantum code-cracking resides in the concepts of noise and error correction, according to Kak. The researcher details:

“For computers to function properly, they must correct all small random errors. In a quantum computer, such errors arise from the non-ideal circuit elements and the interaction of the qubits with the environment around them.”

For these reasons the qubits can lose coherency in a fraction of a second and, therefore, the computation must be completed in even less time. If random errors – which are inevitable in any physical system – are not corrected, the computer’s results will be worthless.

This error correction complicates things even more. The potential for noise-related errors necessitates the need for more qubit power. Theoretical physicist Mikhail Dyakonov describes the mind-boggling nature of the problem, saying:

“While a conventional computer with N bits at any given moment must be in one of its 2N possible states, the state of a quantum computer with N qubits is described by the values of the 2N quantum amplitudes, which are continuous parameters (ones that can take on any value, not just a 0 or a 1). This is the origin of the supposed power of the quantum computer, but it is also the reason for its great fragility and vulnerability.

So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment … is much, much greater than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe.

In other words, the strength of practical quantum computing can also be seen as its Achilles heel. Because it can process so many variables, these seemingly endless variables also open the door for greater potential error. Resulting hardware and logistical considerations are not as often discussed as other issues, but according to the two researchers these areas are of critical importance.

Looking Past the Hype

Dyakonov, like Kak, points to the hype surrounding the field of quantum computing, which has been in development and a source of energized speculation for decades. While it is unclear exactly how far classified government and high-level scientific developments may have come by now, as far as the educated observer can tell, it seems there’s a long way to go before the Bitcoin network may be in danger. At which point algorithmic upgrades have been suggested by many as a potential solution.

Still, like ongoing work in nuclear fusion, quantum computing is not to be ignored. An unforeseen breakthrough could theoretically happen at any time and change the game. Kak, for his part, remains skeptical: “As someone who has worked on quantum computing for many years, I believe that due to the inevitability of random errors in the hardware, useful quantum computers are unlikely to ever be built.”

Asia and Europe are the fastest growing markets for digital assets at the moment … Besides the exchange of knowledge and technology, possible fields of collaboration include the cross issuance and listing of digital assets, trading and brokerage as well as the creation of the first global custody bridge.

Boerse Stuttgart’s Growing Presence in the Crypto Space

Boerse Stuttgart Group launched a digital asset trading platform called Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange (BSDEX) in September. Earlier this month, the group opened the platform to all traders in Germany.

The company describes the platform as “Germany’s first regulated trading venue for digital assets where investors’ orders are executed directly against each other according to fixed rules.” It meets the regulatory requirements in accordance with section 2, paragraph 12 of the German Banking Act. The platform operator, Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange GmbH, is a joint venture of Boerse Stuttgart GmbH, Axel Springer SE and finanzen.net GmbH. Blocknox, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, acts as the custodian holding customers’ cryptocurrencies.

Early this year, Boerse Stuttgart launched a crypto trading app called Bison, developed by Sowa Labs, a fintech subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures. The smartphone app can be used to buy and sell BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP from financial services provider Euwax AG, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart.

SBI Has Been in Crypto Business Since 2016

The SBI Group is a major Japanese financial services company group based in Tokyo. The group has been in the crypto business since 2016. Among its crypto-related affiliated companies are SBI VC Trade, one of the first registered crypto exchanges in Japan; SBI Crypto, which specializes in crypto mining; SBI Crypto Investment, which invests in crypto startups; and SBI Mining Chip, which manufactures mining chips and develops mining systems for crypto assets.

SBI VC Trade was registered with Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), in September 2017 to operate a crypto exchange. It was one of 11 crypto exchange operators the FSA approved that month. Japan now has 21 registered crypto exchanges. SBI launched a crypto spot trading service called “Vctrade” in July last year for pre-registered investors and proceeded with the public launch the following month. The group also established SBI Ripple Asia in 2016 and SBI R3 Japan in January. Furthermore, on Oct. 1, SBI Securities and five other Japanese brokerage firms established the Japan Security Token Offering (STO) Association.

However, many times, the price follows fundamentals higher with a lag. The crypto markets have an uncanny ability to surprise analysts by moving opposite to the general perception.

As the year draws to an end, the focus will shift to the events of the next year. Bitcoin’s halving, the United States Presidential election and the United Kingdom’s Brexit, are just a few of the events that might influence crypto prices.

It is difficult to predict the reaction of the crypto markets to such events. Therefore, as investors, identifying the trend of cryptocurrencies is important. Buying in a downtrend can quickly turn the position into a loss and can be mentally taxing. Many times, if the price continues to decline, investors lose patience and dump positions at the bottom. Therefore, it is best to buy in an uptrend or at least after the prices have bottomed out.

After the recent declines, do any of the major cryptocurrencies show signs of bottoming out? Let’s analyze the top performers of the past seven days to see if we spot any buying opportunities.

HT/USD

With a rise of just above 2% in the past seven days, Huobi Token (HT) has turned out to be the best performer. There was no specific news in the past seven days which supported the price increase. Does it mean that the price has declined to levels that make it attractive for the aggressive bulls? Let’s analyze its chart.

The HT/USDT pair has been trading inside a descending channel since topping out in early August. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in negative territory, which indicates that bears are in command.

Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally from $0.88 to $5.3506. This shows demand at lower levels. If the buyers can push the price above the resistance line of the channel, the pair is likely to pick up momentum. The first target is the $4.08 to $4.37 zone and above it $5.3506. We will wait for the price to sustain above the descending channel before turning positive.

Conversely, if the price turns down from the moving averages at $3 or from the resistance line of the channel at $3.30 and plummets below the recent low of $2.7539, the pair will turn hugely negative.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has held up relatively well in the current decline. This shows that stronger hands are not dumping their positions. The digital asset’s market dominance has increased from about 66.3% to about 68.3% over the past week.

Earlier this week billionaire Bitcoin bull Tim Draper reiterated his long-term bullish view on Bitcoin. He expects Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by 2022. Draper’s view was endorsed by Brian Kelly, founder and CEO at BKCM LLC and Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee. Is Bitcoin a good investment at current levels or can it plummet further? Let’s find out.

The BTC/USD pair is stuck inside a falling wedge pattern. If the bulls can propel the price above the wedge, it will signal a change in trend. The bulls held the critical support at $6,512.01 during the week, which shows buying at lower levels.

A breakout of $7,856.76 will complete a double bottom pattern, which is a bullish sign. This setup has a minimum target objective of $9,201.51. Above this level, a move to $10,360.89 is possible. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $7,856.78 and keep a stop below the recent low of $6,435.

Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the pair might consolidate between $7,856.76 and $6,512.01 for a few more weeks. The pair will resume its downtrend on a break below $6,512.01. Such a move will dampen sentiment and delay the start of the next leg of the up move.

TRX/USD

TRON’s (TRX) founder Justin Sun has committed $1 million to young Swedish activist Great Thunberg’s initiative to raise awareness about the climate. The altcoin was the third-best performer of the past seven days with a marginal rise of just over 1%. Can the bulls build on this outperformance or will the bears pounce on this attempt to bounce? Let’s study the chart.

The bulls have once again held the support at $0.011240, which is a positive sign. This shows accumulation by the buyers at lower levels. The TRX/USD pair can now move up to $0.0163957, which is likely to act as a strong resistance.

If the price turns down from $0.0163957 or from the 20-week EMA, it might remain range-bound for a few more weeks. The pair will resume its downtrend on a break below $0.011240.

Conversely, if the bulls can scale the price above the 20-week EMA, a rise to $0.02340 is possible. We will wait for the price to rise and sustain above $0.0163957 before turning positive in the short-term.

NEO/USD

NEO was among the top five performers for the second consecutive week. This is a positive sign as it shows that NEO’s investors are not dumping their holdings in the recent decline. Is this a sign that the altcoin is getting ready for a sharp rebound? Let’s find out.

The bulls bought the dip below $8 in the past week, which is a positive sign. It shows buying at lower levels. However, we anticipate the NEO/USD pair to face stiff resistance at the moving averages.

If the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will again attempt to sink the pair to the critical support at $5.58. A break below this level will be a huge negative and will resume the downtrend.

On the other hand, if the bulls can propel the price above the moving averages, a rally to $13.88772 is likely. We will wait for the price to bounce off the support at $5.58 or sustain above the moving averages before turning positive.

LEO/USD

UNUS SED LEO (LEO) slipped by about 2% in the past seven days but still turned out as the fifth-best performer among major cryptocurrencies. This shows that the sentiment remains negative across the crypto sector.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is attempting to attract customers by expanding its services. It recently announced that its users can purchase cryptocurrencies with both debit cards or credit cards directly. Will these steps by Bitfinex boost LEO’s price? Let’s analyze its chart.

The LEO/USD pair is in a downtrend. It dipped to $0.83712 levels during the week, which was very close to our target objective of $0.8276. We anticipate this level to provide some support. The RSI has also dipped into the oversold zone, which suggests a relief rally is likely.

On the upside, the bulls will face stiff resistance at $0.941. If the price turns down from this level, the bears will attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below the recent low of $0.83712 can drag the price to $0.65.

The pair will show strength if it sustains above $0.941. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before turning positive.

As the end of 2019 approaches, it means there will be one year left for John McAfee’s infamous wager that said the price per bitcoin would “reach $1,000,000 before the end of 2020.” If the forecast doesn’t come to fruition, he said that he would eat his family jewels on television. At the moment, the price of BTC is 95% below McAfee’s prediction.

John McAfee’s Infamous Bet

In 2017, John McAfee made a bet that the price of BTC would touch one million dollars before the end of 2020. The new year is less than 10 days away and BTC has a long way to go in order for McAfee to win his notorious wager. At the time of publication, the price per BTC at $7,400 per coin is 95.47% below the $1 million mark. The bet is well known throughout the cryptosphere because McAfee promised to indulge in an interesting endeavor on television. The 2020 U.S. presidential candidate promised to “eat” his genitals “on national television” if he loses. At the time, McAfee’s bet was lower as his target price was initially $500K per bitcoin. However, he upped the stakes to $1 million and insisted he would still perform the crazy act on TV if he is wrong.

Later in 2019, McAfee discussed his price prediction again when he told the public he was misquoted in regards to the technical terms of his wager. “Dec. 31, 2020, is not an exact date — Let’s all be clear again: I predicted Bitcoin would reach $1,000,000 before the end of 2020. That is not saying it will hit that price on that date,” McAfee explained in February. 2020 is fast approaching and McAfee has been on the run from U.S. authorities and living off the grid. He’s still super busy and launched a crypto trading multi-platform called ‘Magic’ and started a decentralized token exchange with no restrictions. McAfee recently caught up with news.Bitcoin.com during the first week of December and discussed a variety of subjects.

Price Tracking and Countdown Websites Dedicated to McAfee’s Wager

McAfee’s wager has sparked lots of conversations on social media and crypto forums but it’s also invoked a data analysis site called dickline.info. The website shows how far BTC has to go to reach McAfee’s predicted target. Right now the digital asset would have to climb at a rate of 0.484095526 % per day to get to the $1 million mark. The creators of the data website dedicated to McAfee’s wager do not dismiss the fact that it’s quite possible McAfee’s prediction could come to fruition. “Compared to the enormous price changes, half a percent does not sound like much to you — This is the magic of exponential growth,” the website states.

The website also lets users make their own price prediction and there’s a calculator that allows visitors to change parameters. In addition to dickline.info’s statistical information, there’s the countdown website dickening.com. The site is fully dedicated to the McAfee wager and it says there are 375 days left until the last day of 2020. The website also notes that the ‘Halvening’ will take place first and also explains that McAfee could be correct.

“Conversely, if bitcoin is worth one million dollars by that day, most of the world is going to feel like dicks for not listening,” the website states. At this time of year, thought leaders and crypto influencers are prone to make price predictions, but it’s likely most people will forget these forecasts. McAfee’s bet, on the other hand, will be remembered as people are eagerly tracking his prediction.

Tax authorities around the world are increasing their focus on crypto transactions and companies are rushing to help investors navigate the unclear regulations. The latest example is Thomson Reuters which has added a new tool for American tax payers to report crypto dealings to the IRS.

Thomson Reuters Gosystem Tax Now Supports Crypto

Toronto-headquartered multinational mass media and information firm, Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE: TRI), has revealed that its Individual Gosystem Tax system is launching a “Virtual Currency Organizer” for IRS 1040 form preparation. The tool will be a single point of data entry for crypto dealings including exchanges, forks, purchases and payments. Users of the income tax software suite will now be able to review all transactions in a central location and have the information properly reported on the relevant forms.

“Virtual currencies, or cryptocurrencies, continue to be a dizzying draw to investors. Many times, the investors are not considering, or fully aware of, the tax implications of their activity in this exciting new asset class. The IRS, however, has been keenly aware of the obligations in this area and has recently raised its scrutiny and compliance level,” the company explained. “Given both the IRS focus on and accelerating proliferation of digital assets, Thomson Reuters recognizes the additional challenge that this digital asset class introduces and is committed to providing industry-leading solutions in this new frontier of tax reporting.”

To deliver this new service, Thomson Reuters has entered into a collaboration with a firm that specializes in the accounting and reporting of cryptocurrencies, Verady. Its Ledgible platform allows investors, tax preparers and financial institutions to perform portfolio tracking and reporting of cryptocurrency activity. It has been specifically designed to simplify the lengthy and complex process of consolidating records from exchanges, wallets, blockchain explorers, and other cryptocurrency data sources.

Ledgible supports many digital assets including BTC, BCH, BTG, BSV, DASH, EOS, ETC, LTC, XMR, XLM, ZEC, ETH and ERC20 tokens. The supported exchanges are Bibox, Binance, Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini, Hitbtc, Huobi, Kraken, Lbank, Okex, Poloniex and ZB. The platform also supports a wide array of hardware and custodial wallets including Trezor, Ledger and Bitgo.

IRS Focuses on Crypto Traders

The launch of new crypto tax services at this time is not surprising considering the focus by IRS on the field. As news.Bitcoin.com previously reported, 2019 will be the first year that the IRS will explicitly ask U.S. taxpayers to disclose all their cryptocurrency dealings. In fact, the new 1040 IRS filing form for the 2019 tax year now includes a “Question #0” at the very beginning of the form asking about any taxpayer activity with virtual currencies.

In July of this year the IRS sent out 10,000 letters to American tax payers that it suspected of having crypto transactions that they failed to report and pay the resulting tax from or did not report their transactions properly. “Taxpayers should take these letters very seriously by reviewing their tax filings and when appropriate, amend past returns and pay back taxes, interest and penalties,” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said as the time. “The IRS is expanding our efforts involving virtual currency, including increased use of data analytics. We are focused on enforcing the law and helping taxpayers fully understand and meet their obligations.”

Last week Lukka announced its DIY tax preparation product for U.S. taxpayers invested in cryptocurrencies. It is designed to provide taxpayers with a secure, guided tax reporting experience that enables the accurate calculation of taxable gain/loss on crypto investments at an affordable price. The new offering evolved from Libra Tax, the commercial crypto tax calculator released in 2014, and is built to complete crypto data collection, enrichment, and calculation processes not supported by traditional tax preparation software solutions.

“Lukka is bringing institutional-grade tax preparation products to all consumers with scalable and secure tools that have guided experiences and are incredibly easy-to-use,” said Jake Benson, Founder and CEO of Lukka. “Considering the intense IRS focus on compliance and lack of accuracy in prior year reporting, we believe that the do-it-yourself taxpayer requires a purpose-built crypto tax product they can trust will comply with IRS requirements; Lukka Tax meets that need.”

Authorities in Uzbekistan have effectively banned residents from purchasing cryptocurrencies on digital asset exchanges licensed in the country. Crypto holders will only be able to sell their coins and that’s if these have not been obtained through anonymous transactions, amendments to the local regulations postulate.

Uzbekistan Amends Its Crypto Regulations

The Central Asian republic made it to the crypto media headlines last year, when it legalized cryptocurrency trading and introduced licensing for exchanges with a presidential decree issued in the fall of 2018. An earlier decree, signed by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev in the summer of that same year, prepared the legal grounds for other activities related to the circulation of digital coins. For a while, the country looked like a promising destination for crypto business.

However, the National Agency for Project Management, which is subordinated to the presidency, has recently adopted amendments to the regulatory regime that significantly limit options for local private individuals using cryptocurrency. According to a new order issued by the agency on Dec. 6, Uzbekistan citizens will only be allowed to sell crypto assets on registered exchanges, Sputink and Forklog reported. Besides, using decentralized cryptos as a means of payment is now prohibited in the country.

On top of that, performing any transactions with coins that have been acquired through anonymous transactions is banned as well, although it remains unclear how regulators will determine whether someone’s digital money has been involved in such transfers. Trading platforms should only serve users with verified identities, who are 18 years or older, and whose names are not on the government’s list of individuals suspected of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Changes Inspired by FATF Standards

Cryptocurrency exchanges have been obliged to keep records of all trades conducted on their platforms for at least five years. Any violations of the country’s laws should also be recorded and reported to Uzbekistan’s law enforcement in writing. According to the media reports, these new requirements have been inspired by the global standards on crypto assets adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in June this year.

Uzbekistan authorities have nevertheless not given up entirely on their initial intention to accommodate crypto businesses in the country. The project management agency under President Mirziyoyev hopes that despite the stringency of the newly adopted rules, the overall regulatory framework will attract fresh foreign investments. The executive power in Tashkent also expects that crypto companies will generate additional revenues for Uzbekistan’s commercial banks that provide services to the sector.

When the crypto industry was granted regulatory recognition last year, Uzbekistan sought to acquire know-how from others with more experience in the field. The government signed an agreement with the Korean Blockchain Business Association which had to help with the implementation of the Uzbekistan Revolution 4.0 project aimed at developing the country’s blockchain space. The cooperation had to lead to the establishment of a national cryptocurrency exchange, industrial mining center, blockchain academy, and the legalization of coin offerings. It’s unclear whether there’s been any substantial progress on this track since then.

Eight lawmakers have sent a letter to the IRS seeking answers to new questions stemming from the latest crypto tax guidance. They pointed out a number of major issues including unwarranted tax liabilities for crypto users who unwillingly receive forked or airdropped coins.

Guidance Comes Years After Major Forks

Eight members of the U.S. Congress have sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requesting answers regarding the tax treatments of crypto transactions, pointing out major issues in the agency’s latest guidance. The letter, dated Dec. 20, is addressed to IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig. It was signed by Congressmen Tom Emmer, David Schweikert, Lance Gooden, Matt Gaetz, Bill Foster, Darren Soto, French Hill, and Warren Davidson. Firstly, the congressmen wrote:

The guidance appears inequitable as it comes almost two years after the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash fork and three years after the Ethereum fork.

The lawmakers referenced their April letter to the commissioner urging the issuance of tax guidance for crypto users. The IRS published its newest guidance in October, which supplements the previous one published in 2014. However, the crypto community immediately spotted numerous problems with the guidelines.

Unrealistic

The congressmen proceeded to address the tax issues surrounding hard forks and airdrops which the guidance focuses on, claiming:

The hypothetical fact patterns concerning forks and airdrops offered in this guidance do not appear to bear a close resemblance to actual forks or airdrops as they have occurred in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

“Without clear and accurate hypotheticals for taxpayers to measure against, it is difficult to interpret IRS policy as it relates to actual events,” the letter adds.

Unwarranted Tax Liability

Another major issue raised by the congressmen concerns how the IRS plans to tax an airdrop following a hard fork. “The IRS appears to adopt as a standard ‘dominion and control’ over forked or airdropped assets in order to determine when a taxable event occurs,” the letter details. According to the tax guidance, recipients will “have ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received … provided you have dominion and control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency.”

However, the congressmen asserted that this treatment appears to diverge from established tax rules in other areas such as the receipt of unsolicited prizes or samples. Emphasizing that it would mean crypto owners would owe taxes from forks or airdrops even if they have no knowledge of them or take no step to claim or access airdropped or forked tokens, the lawmakers elaborated:

This creates potentially unwarranted tax liability and administrative burdens for users of these important new technologies and would create inequitable results. We do not expect this is the intended effect of the guidance, and we urge the IRS to clarify the matter.

The IRS has tried to clarify how it plans to treat promotional airdrops but has yet to provide clear answers.

Guidance Ignores Many Crypto Products

The IRS primarily focused on hard forks and airdrops in its guidance and failed to address many other crypto-related products on the market that may lead to tax liabilities, the letter conveys. The lawmakers stressed the importance of the agency providing guidance on how income related to all crypto transactions are taxed, noting:

The guidance also does not contemplate the vast variety of products offered in the cryptocurrency market: futures, retirement accounts invested in crypto assets, and interest paid on crypto deposits, to name just a few.

Tax Withholding, Reporting, Established Law

The lawmakers then addressed two more problems. The first concerns tax withholding and reporting, and they claim the IRS has failed to provide any clarity on these areas. They explained that taxpayers rely on forms such as 1099 to help complete their income taxes. However, “Since many are either not reporting 1099s at all or are reporting incorrect or incomplete information, it is imperative that the IRS publish clear information in further guidance.”

The second problem concerns how “the form of the guidance appears to indicate that this is ‘established’ law,” the letter describes. The congressmen then urged the IRS to recognize that cryptocurrency is a new and developing area and allow for reasonable interpretations. While commending the IRS for issuing its guidance, the lawmakers suggested “increased work with the industry into the future.”

Three Pressing Questions for IRS

After detailing the problems with the guidance, the lawmakers asked the IRS three questions. They noted that legislation has been introduced to protect taxpayers from liabilities from forks and airdrops until the IRS has provided clarity.

“In spite of the recent guidance, cryptocurrency users continue to lack any meaningful clarity about their tax obligations with respect to forks and airdrops,” the letter adds, concluding:

Until there is clear guidance that is prospective in nature, we urge the IRS to use its authority for penalty relief in those instances in which taxpayers made a good faith effort to comply.

New US Crypto Bill, SEC’s Proposal, Letter to IRS

U.S. lawmakers are reportedly discussing a new bill entitled “Crypto-Currency Act of 2020.” Its stated purpose is to “clarify which federal agencies regulate digital assets, to require those agencies to notify the public of any federal licences, certifications, or registrations required to create or trade in such assets, and for other purposes.”

The bill divides cryptocurrencies into three types: “crypto-commodity,” “crypto-currency,” and “crypto-security.” It proposes that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates the first type, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) the second type, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the third type.

Meanwhile, the SEC has proposed amending the definition of “accredited investor” to allow additional qualifications such as those based on professional knowledge, experience, or certifications. This will boost access to crypto investments since a number of them are currently only available to accredited investors. The Commission has also postponed its decision on the proposed rule change filed by NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the “United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust.” It has now designated Feb. 26 as the date by which it shall either approve or disapprove this proposed rule change.

As for crypto taxation, eight congressmen have sent a letter to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) asking for clarification on how certain crypto transactions are taxed. The lawmakers pointed out a number of issues in the agency’s latest guidance, including unwarranted tax liabilities for crypto users who unwillingly receive forked or airdropped coins.

Among them are House Bills 4102-4107 which “is a package of bills that amends various sections of the Michigan Penal Code to add direct and indirect reference to cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology,” the announcement describes.

House Bill 4102 prohibits the collection of any property or other valuables, including cryptocurrency, for the fighting baiting, or shooting of an animal. House Bill 4103 modifies the definition of “financial transaction device” to include the use of cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.

House Bill 4104 modifies the definition of “racketeering” while House Bill 4105 specifies that “other personal property” would include cryptocurrency. House Bill 4106 makes altering a record made using distributed ledger technology a felony, and House Bill 4107 adds cryptocurrency to the definition of “monetary instrument.”

France’s First Approved ICO

The French financial markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), has approved the country’s first initial coin offering (ICO). The issuer is a company called French-ICO. French Law No. 2019-486 of 22 May 2019, also referred to as the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation (Pacte) law, has introduced a regulatory framework for crypto assets and ICOs in France. The law gives issuers the option to obtain approval for their token sales from the AMF. “Although this approval is optional and ICOs without AMF approval will therefore continue to be legal, only those public offerings that have received the AMF approval may be marketed directly to the public in France,” the regulator explained.

Muslim Crypto

At the four-day Kuala Lumpur Summit, the leaders of a number of Muslim countries discussed creating a unified Muslim cryptocurrency. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani “proposed an Islamic financial payment with Muslim countries trading in local currencies and the creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar and weather the effects of market fluctuation,” the Associated Press detailed. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad supported the idea. “It is the first time we hear Iran and also Turkey are of the opinion that if we do not have American dollars, we can use our own currency or one common currency that we (Muslim nations) can create if we agree,” he said.

China Questions Crypto Exchanges

Eight crypto companies have reportedly been placed under inquiry by the authorities in Shenzhen, China. Two of them were allegedly trading platform operators and six were associated with initial coin offerings. The authorities reportedly questioned representatives of the companies at a meeting hosted by the Financial Regulatory Bureau of Shenzhen Municipality on Dec. 18, with the participation of 10 other regulatory bodies. The regulators said they have conducted both online and offline investigations. A representative of the bureau clarified that the companies that have been questioned “have troubles,” but emphasized that it does not mean those that have not been questioned have no problem.

ECB’s Eurochain and ‘Anonymous’ CBDC

The European Central Bank (ECB) published a 10-page report entitled “Exploring anonymity in central bank digital currencies” on Dec. 17, showcasing its blockchain technology proof-of-concept. It explains how a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could work. The concept, aimed to contribute to the broader discussion of central bank chains, deploys several features created by R3 and Accenture. The ECB calls the network “Eurochain.”

The report highlights the benefits of the hypothetical network and discusses how anonymity can fit into the logistics. It also describes how the ECB plans to enforce AML/CTF limits on the amount that a CBDC user can spend without the AML authority’s involvement.

Indian State to Produce 20,000 Blockchain Specialists

The Indian state of Kerala is planning to produce thousands of blockchain specialists. The state’s Information Technology Secretary Shri. M Sivasankar declared during the Blockhash Live 2019 conference: “The coming two years are crucial for us as we plan to produce 20,000 blockchain experts. The emphasis is on enhancing the quality of manpower steered by young startup companies.” He believes that blockchain technology is “a promising, new-age cutting edge technological innovation,” noting its potential to disrupt various business sectors including banking, insurance, trade finance, and retail. The event was organized by Kerala Blockchain Academy. It was attended by civil servants and industry representatives who spoke about positioning Kerala as the blockchain hub of India.

Poland Backdates Crypto Tax

The Polish tax administration has clarified that the Civil Law Transactions Tax (PCC) is applicable to crypto trades conducted before last year’s moratorium on its collection. The PCC is a 1% or 2% tax levied on sales of assets outside the scope of Europe’s value-added tax (VAT). The Polish Ministry of Finance imposed a temporary hold on its collection in the summer of 2018, which was extended in July this year until June 30, 2020.

Coinbase is shutting down the startup Earn.com which it acquired for an estimated $100 million last year. The email service allowed senders to pay users in digital currency for replying to commercial messages or completing tasks.

Coinbase Says Goodbye to Earn.com

San Francisco-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase has reportedly decided to shut down Earn.com (formerly known as 21 Inc). The exchange notified clients of the decision via email, explaining that it is “sunsetting Earn.com to focus exclusively on Coinbase Earn,” The Block reported on Monday. Users of the service were given about two months’ notice until they have withdraw all their funds.

The company also added that it plans on “scaling Coinbase Earn even further by adding more campaigns to the platform, to connect more blockchain networks with engaged crypto users.” Coinbase Earn is a service meant to incentive people to learn more about new cryptocurrencies. The educational platform rewards users with tokens for completing various tasks such as watching videos and taking quizzes on crypto-related content.

$100 Million Acquisition

The idea behind Earn.com was allowing senders to pay users in digital currency for replying to emails and completing tasks, which is meant to benefit both normal email users and large-scale senders of commercial emails. A normal email user could earn crypto by replying to emails and also use the price of inbound emails as a signal to rank them by importance. Senders of commercial email could use Earn.com to pay users to get them to reply to messages regrading subjects such as recruiting, fundraising, and marketing which most users just filter as spam under normal circumstances.

Coinbase only announced that it had acquired Earn.com in April 2018. The two sides have not revealed the financial details of the deal but it wa estimated at the time to be just above $100 million. This was considerably lower than previous valuations for the startup and caused a push-back from investors according to Silicon Valley media reports.

As part of the acquisition, Earn’s co-founder and CEO Balaji Srinivasan joined Coinbase as the company’s first Chief Technology Officer (CTO). Earn.com promised its users at the time that it was not ”going down” or drastically changing. In fact, the company claimed that the product was only going to get “bigger and better” as a consequence of this deal.

The cryptocurrency mining confiscation came as part of an inspection of more than 70,000 households, 3,061 merchants, 1,470 communities, as well as factories, mines, courtyards and villages in the Kaiping District of Tangshan city. The inspection was carried out by Tangshan police in collaboration with State Electric Power Department and other authorities looking to inspect suspicious electricity use.

During the investigation, which initially started in April last year, the authorities seized 6,890 ASIC miners and 52 high-power transformers. According to the police, crypto miners were stealing electricity from a nearby village. The police also said that Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines were operating 24 hours a day, consuming electricity at rates up to 40 times those of a regular family.

Crackdown on crypto mining

China, whose BTC miners are currently responsible for as much as 66% of global hash rate, has been actively fighting illicit use of energy by crypto miners. In mid-November, regulators in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region tightened their grip on crypto mining companies, as they intend to dispatch inspection units to assure the “clean-up and rectification of crypto token mining companies” in the region.

Some other jurisdictions like Abkhazia have also intensified work on the identification of crypto mining farms. The government brought to notice earlier in December that the significantly increased loads on electric networks were aggravated by the emergence of an ever-growing number of illegal crypto mining farms connected to a local power utility.

In November, Iranian authorities offered a bounty to anyone who exposes unauthorized mining operations in the country. People who expose cryptocurrency mining operations that are illicitly using subsidized electricity will purportedly receive up to 20% of the recovered damages.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-subreddit-subscribers-surge-following-cryptos-summer-bull-run,"The Bitcoin (BTC) subreddit has seen a remarkable increase in its number of subscribers since the cryptocurrency’s price spike last summer.

Cypherpunk and proclaimed Bitcoin maximalist Jameson Lopp posted a tweet on Dec. 23, saying “the rate of new subscribers to the /r/bitcoin subreddit accelerated after the exchange rate jumped this summer. It grew in size by 222,000 users - 22% growth in 2019.”

At the beginning of 2019, the subreddit broke a milestone of 1 million subscribers, which means that it has added more than 200,000 new members over the past year.

Reddit is a major forum for the cryptocurrency space, with many industry-related firms and foundations using it to interact with their user base. The Bitcoin community on Reddit started at the end of 2012, slowly gaining popularity until the leading digital currency hit $20,000 at the end of 2017, having grown by 1,950%.

The surge in the Bitcoin price met a generous response from markets, triggering mass consumer interest in both buying and trading the virtual currency, as well as joining the Bitcoin community online.

Examining Reddit community sentiment and crypto prices

In May, the University of Notre Dame and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory released a study on the speed and scale of cryptocurrency discussions on Reddit, which covered Reddit threads created in official subreddits and the broader crypto subs between January 2015 and January 2018. The researchers claimed to have found a strong correlation between Reddit conversation volume and coin prices.

In August, research firm Comparitech used a machine learning-based analysis tool to study more than 48,000 Reddit posts to determine which cryptocurrencies were viewed most favorably by the masses.

At the time, Sritanshu Sinha, an independent crypto author and analyst, noted that the overall reception that the crypto industry has received thus far on forums such as Reddit and Twitter has been quite warm. He was also quick to point out that, since the Reddit community views itself as being anti-establishment, its users are usually drawn to crypto much more than average investors.

Not all crypto observers believe social media sentiment to be an accurate gauge for crypto activity. One twitter user and self-purported Bitcoin observer responded to Lopp’s tweet, stating, “user numbers on social media platforms are meaningless in this day and age. they might all be bots.”",,https://www.coindesk.com/corporations-need-bitcoin-they-just-dont-know-it-yet,"This post is part of CoinDesk’s 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Chris Dannen is co-founder at Iterative Capital, a New York-based cryptocurrency investment manager, and CEO of i2 Trading, a wholesale dealer and trading desk.

Anyone who has attended cryptocurrency conferences in 2019 has experienced the narrative confusion that hit after the ICO bubble. “Blockchain” companies push lame enterprise products that are, at best, nice to have; token issuers shill new issuances; exchange operators search for capital.

Who isn’t there? Big corporate technology customers. Like any technological device of the last 50 years, cryptocurrency needs to catch their attention before large-scale adoption is feasible.

But two years after the bubble, killer apps are nowhere to be seen. So at the start of a new year, it’s worth asking ourselves what sort of path might bitcoin and its competitors take to get there, and whether 2020 is an inflection point.

Whatever the path and timeline, the transition period for corporations building on bitcoin is sure to be painful; at a big company, technological change always is. Automating payroll, invoicing, expense reporting and other financial operations on top of the bitcoin network would be a slow and expensive process, requiring a massive amount of time and money spent on building software and retraining workers.

Only an extremely serious problem could be the impetus for such a scenario. Does such a problem exist today, and if so, how might cryptocurrency solve it?

The speed of corporate implosion

Consider a few data points:

In 1958, the mean lifespan of a blue-chip company was 61 years; by 2016 it had dropped to 24 years.

Almost three-quarters of a billion hours per week are spent by U.S. workers on internal compliance activities, roughly half of which do not create value.

The return on assets of the top 25 percent of public companies declined from 12.9 percent in 1965 to 8.3 percent in 2015.

Things are going badly for workers, too; since 1976, productivity growth (from technology) has outstripped wage growth by a factor of 5.9.*

From Nokia to Microsoft to Borders to BlackBerry, incumbents fail again and again to preserve their market position and grow wages, despite all the market data they vacuum up each year, all the consultants they pay and all the bright young college grads they hire.

This is a big problem. Why is it so?

The problem is digital technology has advanced the “practical arts” (from spreadsheets to moviemaking) to such a degree that advanced planning and hyper-efficient processes – once strengths of the large hierarchical organization – are no longer as valuable. In an unpredictable, ad-hoc business environment, agility rules and bureaucracy are a drag.

If bitcoin and similar networks can’t help large companies become more agile, they may have little relevance in the economy of the next 20 years. What is the path to utility?

The philosopher Bertrand de Jouvenel theorized we can reason about the future by conceiving of “futuribles.” “A future state of affairs enters into the class of ‘futuribles’ only if its mode of production from the present state of affairs is plausible and imaginable,” he wrote. “A futurible is a descendant of the present, a descendant to which we attach a genealogy” that extends from conditions today.

What are the “conditions” of the whirlwind corporate world of the last decade? In their attempts to move faster and forestall their early demise, the largest incumbents have begun to reorganize to reduce hierarchy and push more decision-making to the margins of the business and away from upper management. What is the corresponding futurible as we look to the 2020s?

What sort of operating model might corporations be forced to adopt next as the physical world digitizes and the speed of business further increases?

The dual-OS company

While he’s never written about cryptocurrency, Harvard Business School professor John P. Kotter originated the concept of “the dual-operating-system company,” which combines a traditional hierarchical management organization with a “network” of supertemps, some paid and some unpaid, outside the office walls.

Hierarchies, he says, are good for planning, creating budgets, defining roles, HR functions and measuring results. “What they do not do well,” he wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 2012, “is identify the most important hazards and opportunities early enough, formulate creative strategic initiatives nimbly enough, and implement them fast enough.”

He advocates what he calls a “second operating system,” a network of people who design and implement strategy from outside. The network half of the dual-OS company is like an immune system for the traditional corporate hierarchy, constantly surveying the business, its markets and its competitors to bring new information and practices in.

Kotter says about 10 percent of the network should be comprised of full-time employees, and the rest carefully selected part-timers and volunteers who are given highly structured processes to make sure their contributions are meaningful, and whose work is seen at high levels of the hierarchy.

There are a few practical problems with an ideal implementation of Kotter’s dual-OS model, however, especially with a very large network. One is payroll. If roles are nonstandard with varying schedules of compensation for part-time, full-time and contract work (and payees constantly dropping on and off at high volume), an army of HR staff would be needed to handle the load. It’s even worse if paychecks are being remitted around the world to a network of external contributors, in places where the business doesn’t have a local office.

Could it be dual-OS is the panacea to ailing corporations and it needs a new sort of financial infrastructure to be implemented economically?

Where bitcoin comes in

Bitcoin is, at heart, infrastructure built for (and by) leaderless groups, operating by emergent consensus. Examples of leaderless groups include not just FOSS developers but also hashtag-based movements like #metoo, or Occupy Wall Street-style protests like the Arab Spring in 2011. In Kotter’s dual-OS company, the “network” half is one such leaderless group.

Bitcoin is ideal infrastructure for leaderless groups because wallets can be issued without permission and bitcoin payments are easy to automate, giving companies the flexibility to pay people in very small or very large amounts, at large scale, anywhere in the world.

Another headache of dual-OS is budgetary permissions. Companies like to set thresholds where staff can spend money with or without permission, but these rules are often not very granular at the corporate credit card level, and enforcing them otherwise can be hard. Custom wallet software, perhaps with multi-signature functionality for large wallets, can help companies put the spending power in the hands of employees, reducing the bottleneck of managerial approval by formalizing the spending rules into the wallet software iself.

Remittance is another issue, for corporations and their employees overseas. Remote offices often need to remit payment back home, but forex conversions can be difficult, slow and expensive in some geographies. Employees working in far-flung places need to be paid locally but also like to send money home; fees and delays abound with existing financial systems. The increasingly global nature of business means that suppliers, manufacturers and logistics agencies may need to be paid in dozens of different currencies.

Thus, the dual-OS operating model seems like a valid futurible for today’s corporations, and its challenges create a need for digitized financial infrastructure.

To the business world, bitcoin and its competitors are effectively competing to be the premier inter-settlement-network network. That is, networks that transmit value between poorly connected fiat systems, filling gaps where other services are too expensive, bureaucratic or slow.

Before long, local money transmitters will be able to push large amounts of value cheaply and instantly through Lightning (or similar) channels from one country to another, meaning their customers never even need to own bitcoin to benefit from the technology to remit value overseas.

This has been a cursory look at how bitcoin might find its way into the mission-critical enterprise stack. In an attempt to remain agile, large incumbents have already begun to wrap themselves in permeable networks, even without knowing how such a dual-OS structure might scale. As they grow their networks, it’s only a matter of time before the cryptocurrency narrative regains its strength.",2019-12-23 14:00:00+00:00,,,

Crypto YouTubers are greeting the holidays with reports that their content appears to have been censored by the platform.

In a tweet published on Dec. 23, Chris Dunn — a crypto YouTuber with 210,000 subscribers and almost 7.5 million channel views — claimed that:

“@YouTube just removed most of my crypto videos citing ""harmful or dangerous content"" and ‘sale of regulated goods’... it's been 10 years of making videos, 200k+ subs, and 7M+ views. WTF are you guys doing @TeamYouTube?!”

In a separate tweet on Dec. 23, crypto education channel Node Investor wrote:

“Merry Christmas to you also @YouTube. Apparently a video I posted two years ago on researching crypto’s is now illegal...Rules are changing.”

Strike Action

Screenshot allegedly showing YouTube’s notice to Chris Dunn. Source: @ChrisDunnTV

In Chris Dunn’s case, a screenshot of the alleged intervention by YouTube apparently indicates that he was served with a “strike” action against at least seven videos, each of which have been designated as “harmful or dangerous content.”

These videos’ titles include “50 Crypto Trading & Investing Lessons from the Past 5 Years,” “Is Bitcoin Really Money?” and “The Future of Initial Coin Offerings.”

According to a second screenshot shared by Dunn — apparently showing a further explanatory notice from YouTube — a “strike” against a channel prevents the YouTuber from uploading, posting or streaming content for one week. A second strike extends this restriction to a two-week period, while a third within any 90-day period results in the permanent removal of the channel.

Node Investor’s tweet reveals a similar notification — apparently pertaining to just one video — indicating that the content has been removed due to a violation of the platform’s “sale of regulated goods policy.”

Cointelegraph has reached out to Chris Dunn and Node Investor and will update this article should any further information be forthcoming.

Platforms’ evolving crypto stance

Even as YouTube does not ostensibly restrict legitimate crypto-related content, cybersecurity researchers have recently detected abuses of the platform for the purposes of spreading cryptojacking malware.

Once blanket-banned on Facebook, Google and Twitter, restrictions on blockchain-related advertisements have now gradually been lifted, and some provisions have been introduced to nuance the policy and permit most forms of crypto-related content, except for misleading or scammy ads.

Cointelegraph has itself faced a brief stint of censorship from Facebook — the first social media platform to initially ban cryptocurrency-related ads — soon after the CT Facebook page published a documentary on the use of cryptocurrencies in the adult entertainment industry.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/greek-court-suspends-decision-to-extradite-alexander-vinnik/,"Greek Court Suspends Decision to Extradite Alexander Vinnik

The Supreme Administrative Court of Greece has suspended a decision to extradite the alleged BTC-e operator Alexander Vinnik. The temporary measure has been imposed to allow the review of an appeal against the extradition. The Russian national, accused of laundering billions of dollars through the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange, started a new hunger strike last week.

France Is First Destination for Vinnik, Russia Listed Last

The decision to extradite Vinnik to France was signed on Friday by the Greek Minister of Justice Konstantinos Tsiaras, who also ordered the director of the Korydallos prison to prepare the necessary documents. It details that the United States should be the second possible destination for Vinnik’s departure, while the Russian Federation has been mentioned as the last option. All three countries have previously asked Greece to hand over Vinnik who was arrested on a U.S. warrant in Thessaloniki more than two years ago.

U.S. prosecutors allege that the Russian blockchain specialist is one of the owners of BTC-e and accuse him of laundering between $4 billion and $9 billion through the trading platform, including funds stolen in the Mt Gox hack. But he is also wanted in France and in his native Russia for various other crimes. Vinnik rejects all these accusations. At the same time, he has already stated he is ready to face trial in his home country. Russian authorities want to prosecute him for the theft of 600,000 rubles (less than $10,000) from a defrauded entity.

Vinnik’s defense believes that if he is handed over to the French authorities, he will eventually end up in U.S. custody. Quoted by Reuters, his Greek lawyer Zoe Konstantopoulou described the ministerial decision as unfair and even called it a “death sentence.” She added that its suspension was a recognition of the risk he would face if he was extradited. Konstantopoulou also revealed that Alexander has begun a new hunger strike and warned that his health is deteriorating.

Next Hearing in Vinnik Case to Be Held in January

On Tuesday, Ekaterina Sakellaropoulou who presides over Greece’s Council of State, the highest administrative court in the country, scheduled the next hearing in the case for Jan. 10, 2020, RIA Novosti reported, quoting Vinnik’s Russian lawyer Timofei Musatov. Initially, the hearing was planned for March 24. He also revealed that an expanded panel of judges will review the case next time, with the Greek court citing its “extraordinary importance.”

Vinnik’s fate has become a source of contention between Europe and America, on the one hand, and Russia on the other. Meanwhile, Greece has found itself under significant pressure from all sides and from his lawyers who insist he is being held against its own laws. The Russian citizen has spent 29 months in Greek jails when according to the country’s constitution, no one should be held in custody for more than 18 months without sentence. They also point out that while the Greek justice ministry has decided to hand him over to France, the European extradition order expired long ago.

There have been four separate decisions by Greek courts so far for the extradition of Vinnik, to the U.S., to France, and two for Russia. The latest issued by the executive power in Athens comes weeks before the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to Washington in early January. Greek media have speculated that their government may extradite Vinnik in the hope of winning President Trump’s backing in the recent disputes with Turkey, including over territorial waters. Greece has made it clear it also expects support from the EU.

Police Seize Thousands of Miners

Chinese police forces from the city of Tangshan, Hebei province, have seized 6,890 bitcoin mining rigs, state broadcaster CCTV (China Central Television) reported on Monday. According to the report this was the result of “special operations to combat the crime of power theft” by public security agencies in various places across the country, in conjunction with the State Electric Power Department.

The Hebei Tangshan Police claim that since April last year they have conducted comprehensive inspections of more than 70,000 households, factories, mines, courtyards, merchants, communities and villages, in conjunction with power supply and other departments. During one of these investigations, the police first found a suspicious private transformer in a compound in a village in Shuangqiao Town, Kaiping District, Tangshan, Hebei. After investigating the site, it was determined that the privately connected transformer was used to mine bitcoin. They seized 1,906 bitcoin miners.

The police also followed a lead and seized three high-power transformers and 790 bitcoin mining machines that were allegedly stealing electricity in a nearby village. According to the police, a rough estimate of the power consumption of the 790 bitcoin mining machines that were seized in that one incident gives them the same consumption of electricity for one day of continuous operation equivalent to the electricity consumption of more than 5,000 Chinese households a day. Police said that the crackdown on electricity theft will continue.

72 Cloud Token Operators Arrested

Police forces in the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi province, have arrested 72 Cloud Token operators according to an official video shared on social media platform Weibo on Monday. The video shows officers hauling off dozens of people in a local train station, hands handcuffed behind their backs, wearing numbered yellow vests and black sacks over their heads. The caption claims that Taiyuan Public Security successfully detected the first Cloud Token platform case in the city that used blockchain to trade virtual currencies in a scam involving more than 30 million yuan (over $4 million) and more than 300 victims.

According to media reports from the country, Cloud Token is a Chinese multi-level marketing scheme with high referral fees that started operating in January of this year. It is said to have similarities to the massive Plus Token Ponzi scam that some believe is responsible for crashing crypto prices.

However, many of the entryways into cryptocurrency markets have a hefty fee between 1-4% of the overall purchase and in order to obtain fiat for crypto the fees are just as high. Many people believe the high fees associated with crypto on-ramps are a deterrent to mass adoption and a concept that minimizes friction will triumph in the end.

The Fees Associated With Fiat-to-Crypto On-Ramps and Off-Ramps

In order to get into the cryptoconomy, there are a few different ways, like earning digital assets for certain services performed. You can also obtain cryptocurrency from popular exchanges that allow people to swap fiat for bitcoin or a variety of other coins. However, it can be pretty costly to get into crypto markets and just as expensive to exit as many companies charge anywhere between 1-4% of the overall sale.

For instance, one of the most popular on-ramp methods in the crypto world is using Coinbase. The San Francisco exchange “charges a spread of about one-half of one percent (0.50%) for digital currency purchases and digital currency sales.” The spread could change due to market fluctuations and Coinbase also charges another fee in addition to the spread. Coinbase charges customers 3.99% for credit or debit purchases and 1.49% for bank-based purchases. The Coinbase fee disclosure also states:

If the total transaction amount is less than or equal to $10, the fee is $0.99.

If the total transaction amount is more than $10 but less than or equal to $25, the fee is $1.49.

If the total transaction amount is more than $25 but less than or equal to $50, the fee is $1.99.

If the total transaction amount is more than $50 but less than or equal to $200, the fee is $2.99.

More recently Square’s Cash App has become a well known choice for buying and selling BTC. Yet despite the popularity, lots of people complain about the app’s fees per transaction. The Cash App also has two types of fees for U.S. users who utilize the application to either enter or exit the cryptoconomy using BTC. First, the Cash App charges a flat 1.75% fee for all purchases and sales, but the platform also charges a “volatility fee” based on price movements. The Atlanta-based payment processor Bitpay charges a fee of 1% per processing fee and the company explains that “merchants may choose to pass this fee on to the buyer.” According to a report published in March by Frank Chaparro, Gemini “has the highest trading fees for retail.” “Gemini’s fees come in at a whopping 2% or 200 basis points,” Chaparro wrote at the time.

The biggest problem in crypto fees. These companies are robbing us blind. It just cost me $12 to sell $2500 of BTC on @coinbase.@jacks's Cash App is even worse, they charge a whopping 1.75 percent per BTC transaction. The company that solves the onramp fee issue wins. — SHILL GATES (@ImShillGates) December 13, 2019

Flat Fees, Variables, and Exchange Tokens

Fiat on and off-ramps to get into cryptocurrency have always involved fees, especially when it comes to deposits and withdrawals. A lot of the time these businesses calculate fees in two different ways and the most common is the flat fee. However, some exchanges have variable fees and unique tier structures that can change the fee depending on sale size and the market’s volatility.

Most exchanges in 2019 have similar rates and have adopted each other’s fee schedules and guidelines. Bitstamp has a minimum fee of €10 in withdrawal fees for SEPA transfers and international withdrawals will incur an additional 0.09% using the European exchange. Bitpanda charges 1.29% to sell and 1.49% to buy and Coinmama charges 5% if the customer uses a debit or credit card. Fees tend to be slightly higher when customers opt to use credit or debit cards and entry into the cryptoconomy in this manner can be costly.

Despite the fact that users don’t like high fees and it might deter newcomers from entering the cryptosphere, it seems high fees are here to stay. Over the last few years, however, exchanges have created exchange-developed coins that are used specifically to alleviate the cost of trading fees. This concept has become popular and exchanges like Binance, Coinflex, and Coinex have leveraged this idea. For instance, the Coinflex token FLEX is an SLP-based token that’s used to give Coinflex traders payouts depending on how much volume the user trades. FLEX tokens are then used to reduce the cost of trading fees on the exchange “incurred during the previous day.”

Bitcoin.com is also launching an exchange token called BCE and according to the whitepaper: “Users will get a discount on exchange fees by paying with the BCE token as per the discount schedule — the discount schedule will be refreshed at year five.” The first year will save users 50%, the second year 25%, year three 12.5%, year four 6.75%, and the fifth year will be announced nearer the time. It’s quite possible that exchange tokens could be the solution that helps reduce friction associated with crypto exchange fees.

For example, in January, the total market capitalization of this burgeoning sector was around $130 billion. However, by July, the market at large had witnessed an influx of bullish momentum that pushed the total capitalization value of this space to a whopping $373 billion. Following this period, the aforementioned bull run proceeded to subside quite a bit, with the market now hovering a tad under the $200 billion threshold.

A few cryptocurrencies maintained a strong financial standing all year long and were able to stave off the various economic slumps that were observed throughout 2019. Here are the standout cryptos not named Bitcoin.

ChainLink

While a fair few people may be surprised to see ChainLink (LINK) in the list of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of 2019. The platform essentially seeks to bridge the gap that exists between blockchain-based smart contracts and real-world applications.

From an economic standpoint, LINK started the year relatively slow — with the price of a single token rising from $0.31 to just over $0.45 over a five-month period. However, by the first week of July, the currency reached its financial apex, with a single LINK token being traded for as high as $3.74. And while the currency has lost a bit of its insane financial momentum over the last couple of months, LINK is still trading slightly above the $1.90 mark.

All in all, the LINK/USD trading pair has surged by over 500% since the start of the year, and the LINK/BTC pair has also gained more than 300% over the same time period — which is quite an impressive feat, to say the least.

Binance Coin

Released onto the market back in mid-2017, Binance Coin (BNB) is a token that can be used for trading purposes as well as for the facilitation of various fee-related payments within the Binance exchange platform. Not only that, but Binance also provides BNB holders with various incentives and discounts for making use of the digital currency for internal transactions.

In regard to BNB’s performance, the currency started the year at a price point of around $6. However, by the final week of May, the price of a single BNB token rose to $35.20 — thereby signaling a growth of more than 450%. During the third quarter of 2019, BNB’s value slid from $33.10 to $15.79, thus showcasing a drastic reversal in the currency’s fortunes. However, over the last couple of months, BNB’s value has remained relatively stable, with the asset’s average value in December currently floating just below the $14 mark.

Since the start of the year, the overall value of the BNB/USD pair has increased by over 140%.

Tezos

Tezos (XTZ) is a decentralized computing platform that makes use of a formal verification protocol as well as a proof-of-stake consensus module for its internal governance-related matters. In regard to how the system works, XTZ holders who stake their tokens are eligible to receive additional tokens as an incentive for creating and verifying blocks.

From a financial performance standpoint, XTZ started off the year at a price point of $0.47. However, by the end of the first quarter of 2019, the value of a single token had scaled up to an impressive $1.06. XTZ’s performance continued to surge between April and June, with the currency touching its annual high of $1.88 on May 19. During this year’s third quarter, XTZ’s value continued to hover around the $1–$1.20 region. However, since the start of December, the crypto asset has once again picked up momentum, with a single token currently trading for $1.51.

Over the course of 2019, the value of the XTZ/USD trading pair has increased by over 190%.

Synthetix Network Token

The Synthetix Network Token (SNX) is an ERC-20 token that is meant to facilitate all of the native transactions associated with the Synthetix exchange. Additionally, SNX tokens are traded using a peer-to-contract model and are also used as collateral to back SNX synthetic assets, called Synths, that are employed within the Synthetix Network to track the market value of any basic asset.

Between January and April, the price of a single SNX token touched a maximum of $0.07. However, since May, the digital currency has continued to soar in value — with the only major slip coming on Nov. 26, a time when the crypto market at large experienced a major financial pullback.

Overall, since the start of 2019, SNX’s value has increased by over 200%, with the currency currently trading for $1.33.

Bitcoin Cash

Currently one of the market’s top 10 cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is basically a hard fork of Bitcoin.

From a financial perspective, one BCH was trading for $135 during the second week of January. However, by the beginning of April, the currency had soared to over the $300 threshold. The currency reached its annual monetary apex on June 26, when the asset was trading for $479.96. During the third quarter of 2019, BCH’s value remained relatively stable — hovering around the $300 mark — but since the start of November, the currency has been continually slipping in value, with a single coin currently trading just over $195.

All in all, over the course of the last 12 months, the value of the BCH/USD trading pair has risen by over 30%.

Cosmos

Cosmos (ATOM) is a decentralized network comprising of various blockchains that are independent, scalable and interoperable. The platform has gained a lot of attention over the course of 2019, especially since cryptocurrency associated with the network, ATOM, surged dramatically during the month of May. To put things into perspective, it bears mentioning that on Jan. 1, ATOM was trading for a price of $0.001.

As things stand, the currency is selling well over $4.20.

Litecoin

Litecoin (LTC) is a top 10 cryptocurrency that was created by Charlie Lee to serve as a more resource-friendly version of Bitcoin.

LTC was trading for $32 during the first week of January. But by June 22, the altcoin had risen to an impressive price point of $141.73. Since then, LTC’s performance has continued to decline, with the currency trading for an average price of around $43 throughout December.

All in all, the value of the LTC/USD trading pair has increased by around 40% since the start of the year.

Basic Attention Token

Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a digital currency used in the Brave internet browser. Brave is a blockchain-based internet browser that incentivizes its users’ internet habits by rewarding them with BAT tokens for watching ads, spending a certain amount of time on a particular website, etc. From a technical standpoint, the browser’s native framework is quite similar to that of Chromium — a project that was created by Brendan Eich, the man behind JavaScript and the co-founder of the Mozilla project.

BAT started off the year trading at around $0.13. However, by the second half of April, the currency had already scaled up to its annual high of $0.44. Following this period, the top 50 asset continued to slide in value until September, after which it once again began a financial ascent, reaching a relative high of $0.27 on Nov 17. Since the start of December, BAT’s value has remained relatively stable around the $1.70 region.

Over the course of 2019, BAT’s value has increased by around 35%.

Ether

Ether (ETH) is a top 10 crypto asset that is widely recognized as being the second most popular digital asset (i.e., after Bitcoin) on the market today. Ethereum developers envisioned the platform as a “world computer” for smart contracts — a digital protocol that helps facilitate, verify and enforce a contract whose terms have been predetermined. Not only that, but the Ethereum ecosystem also allows for the issuance of ERC-20 tokens.

On Jan. 13, Ether was trading for $116. However, over the course of the following six months, the value of the second-biggest cryptocurrency continued to increase, finally scaling up to its annual high of $334.66 on June 26. Following this period of bullish momentum, Ether once again continued to slide before finally settling down around a price range of $150–$180, except for a brief period in September when the currency surged above the $210 mark.

Since late November, Ether has been trading steadily between $130 and $150, thereby showcasing an overall value increase of around 20% since the start of the year.

EOS

EOS is a cryptocurrency platform that can be used by developers to devise a number of novel decentralized applications. In this regard, the EOS token is used to facilitate the eponymous system’s native transactions as well as its internal processes. Additionally, the EOS blockchain has been designed to be highly scalable and leaves a lot of room for customization — which is one of the main reasons why the project is so popular in the first place.

In terms of EOS’s financial performance, the digital currency was trading for $2.23 during the second week of January. Between the months of February and May, the asset surged quite dramatically, with the value of a single token reaching a price point of $8.54 on May 31. Over roughly the next five months, the currency’s value continued to float between $3–$3.80. However, since the last week of November, EOS has remained quite stable, currently trading around the $2.55 mark.

Presently, the EOS/USD trading pair has gained around a 10% value since the start of the year.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/redditor-creates-btc-themed-game-as-holiday-gift-for-crypto-community,"A Redditor has introduced a new Bitcoin (BTC) video game as a holiday gift to the crypto community.

Shared on Dec. 24 on Reddit, the new “Satoshi vs. the Shills” Bitcoin game is a survival shooter game featuring Bitcoin’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto as the main character.

The arcade game is available on the Google Play store for Android. Big Hands, the developer of the game, has not yet specified to Cointelegraph whether its team is planning to roll out the game on iOS or other platforms as of press time. This article will be updated if new comments come in.

“Bitcoin is dead, bro”

With the game letting players assume the role of Nakamoto, they will have to stand against crowds of shills — people referred to by the crypto community as those who promote cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. On their way to approach the player, these enemies shout out typical shill messages like “Check my grandma's ICO,” “Yeah, but I know of a better coin,” or “Bitcoin is dead, bro.”

The player’s mission is to shoot the shillers and stop them from taking over the world, according to a description available on Google Play.

Close interaction of crypto and game industries

Gaming is one of several sectors highly affected by growing cryptocurrency adoption. Crypto not only serves as a source of game plots (as it does here) but also provides new technology to innovative gaming opportunities. United States IT firm Advanced Micro Devices joined the Blockchain Game Alliance to help advance the technology’s use in the industry on Dec. 12. And according to a recent expert opinion shared with Cointelegraph, gaming is purportedly the key to mass adoption of crypto — gamers are allegedly more tech savvy and open to new ideas than the average internet user.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/startup-brings-crypto-payment-option-to-over-730-locations-worldwide,"Slovenia-based crypto payment infrastructure provider aims to boost cryptocurrency adoption through its global expansion.

GoCrypto, a merchant-oriented upgrade of Eligma’s crypto payments solution Elipay, is targeting expansion into more countries around the world. The plans follow recent contribution into the project, in which Eligma secured 4 million euros (roughly $4.4 million) from Bitcoin.com and Swiss-based Pangea Blockchain Fund.

With the objective to make GoCrypto a global payment scheme that connects cryptocurrency owners, wallets, merchants and cashier systems to enable instant crypto payments, the company’s point-of-sale solution is currently available in nine countries. Initially starting from Slovenia and Croatia, Eligma has broken into other European countries such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Portugal, Slovakia, Turkey and the United Kingdom.

Recently, Eligma’s GoCrypto merchant network has been joined by craft beer producer Brewdog in Hungary’s capital city, Budapest, and Burger King in Slovenia, with the latter being the first physical Burger King location in the world to accept crypto.

As such, GoCrypto now enables customers to use digital currency as a means of payment in more than 730 physical locations across the globe. The service claims a heightened interest from merchants, which are purportedly joining the network on a daily basis. Indeed, this marks a notable increase in the number of partnering stores, up from 240 locations reported in January 2019.

Eligma says that its near-term expansion plans include several countries in South America, whereas in the Columbian and Venezuelan markets, GoCrypto will be present through Xpay, a platform for accepting online payments from e-commerce websites.

GoCrypto is available here

Simple to use

Currently, GoCrypto supports custodial Elly wallets and noncustodial Bitcoin.com wallets, with the latter bringing more than 5 million users worldwide. Through the Elly wallet, consumers can conduct payments with major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as well as the platform’s native token GoC.

According to Eligma, GoCrypto does not require that merchants and users have prior knowledge of the blockchain or cryptocurrency industry or undergo dedicated training. The app’s infrastructure enables both online and offline merchants to accept instant payments with different mobile crypto wallets and receive settlement in their local fiat currency. Moreover, the firm is working on a system that allows merchants to choose between receiving crypto and fiat.

The platform processes real-time, crypto-to-fiat conversion of each payment with no hidden costs or fees. Once a payment is made, GoCrypto enables merchants to produce fiat withdrawals to their wallets or bank accounts, view their payments, and receive reports for their accounting purposes.

The future is for crypto

The company emphasizes its goal to bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream and make them part of daily life and commerce, including a payment alternative in countries with high inflation rates. To achieve this, Eligma developed GoCrypto as an easy-to-use solution that merchants can integrate into existing software with no need to change their hardware.

Dejan Roljic, the CEO of Eligma, previously said: “The development of finance is going towards cash becoming a thing of the past. Among other things, this is because doing business with it is quite time consuming and expensive. We must not forget that cryptocurrencies were envisioned as the electronic cash of the future.”

The purge is here.

Cryptocurrency channels are the latest casualty in YouTube's attack on content creators. Could this be part of Google's overarching plan to enter the financial industry? | Image: JOSH EDELSON / AFP

YouTube mass deletes cryptocurrency videos suddenly and without warning.

Tactical timing over the Christmas holidays suggests the social media sought to minimize outrage and pushback.

This could be a pre-emptive proxy attack by Google in its quest to make a move into the finance industry.

While the world slept on Christmas Eve, the YouTube team was busy carrying out a mass deletion of cryptocurrency videos.

Numerous content creators in the cryptocurrency space were issued with community guideline strikes which judged their videos as “harmful or dangerous content”. Masses of crypto videos were unceremoniously deleted in one fell swoop.

The timing of YouTube’s coordinated attack on the cryptocurrency space betrays part of its motive. By striking at the cryptocurrency space during the busiest time of the year, YouTube apparently hoped to minimize any pushback.

Any notion that YouTube wants to work with its users to resolve its problems can be put safely to bed. Rather, this pre-emptive strike on the crypto world may be YouTube’s first step in removing a competitor from its turf.

YouTube Deletes Swathes of Cryptocurrency Videos

The first sign that something was amiss came on Dec. 23 when YouTuber Chico Crypto’s channel was hit with numerous community strikes. Chico Crypto, real name Tyler Swope, maintained that his videos didn’t violate YouTube’s guidelines.

Indeed, the titles of the videos listed above run the gamut of everyday news articles, research pieces and opinions typically found in the crypto space. Not to mention the often more sensational mainstream media.

Later that night, another cryptocurrency YouTuber, Chris Dunn, was hit with the same sudden mass deletion. Dunn, who has garnered 211,000 subscribers, was also deemed to have engaged in the “sale of regulated goods”.

Then, on Christmas Eve, another YouTuber with over 200,000 subscribers, Ivan on Tech, went down. Like Chico Crypto and Chris Dunn, Ivan on Tech was banned from uploading to YouTube for one week.

YouTube has offered no additional explanation at this time. In search of a reason why it would strike at the crypto space without warning, we land on a Google press announcement from last month…

Google Wants to Crush Competition

Google’s plans to push further into the banking space were met with deep cynicism by the media in November. Its plan to open up a checking account service was seen as a tactical first step in securing a spot in the finance sector.

That’s on top of the proliferation of the Google Pay app, which trebled its monthly user base to 67 million leading into 2019.

Cryptocurrency may still be young and relatively toothless, but its presence on the world stage must be a thorn in the side of Silicon Valley’s mega-corporations.

Not only do corporations lose the custom of cryptocurrency users, they also lose something more valuable – their data. It has been suggested that Google is really attempting to crack the “banking data” industry, rather than the banking industry.

If that really is the case, then it’s easy to see why Google would launch this proxy attack through YouTube. Personal data is the one thing that blockchains don’t require; cryptocurrencies in a time of big data collection, become a threat to the corporations.

Community Rallies Around Threat

Despite the doom and gloom, YouTube’s attack on crypto had the unintended result of bringing the community together.

Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), suggested the blockchain community should attempt to build its own censorship resistant social media platform.

Despite past grievances, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin seconded CZ’s suggestion. While Bitcoin.com’s Executive Chairman, Roger Ver, also showed up to mark his approval with a ‘like’.",2019-12-25 15:45:57+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-influencers-speak-out-on-youtube-deleting-crypto-related-content,"YouTube, one of the most popular social media platforms for video sharing, has aggressively started deleting cryptocurrency-related content from some of the biggest influencers in the industry.

Based on Twitter and Reddit threads, YouTube suddenly began deleting a number of cryptocurrency videos on Dec. 23.

YouTuber Chris Dunn, whose channel has over 210,000 subscribers, noticed on Monday that the platform had removed all of his videos that mentioned cryptocurrencies.

Following this, Dunn tweeted, ""@YouTube just removed most of my crypto videos citing 'harmful or dangerous content' and 'sale of regulated goods'... it's been 10 years of making videos, 200k+ subs, and 7M+ views. WTF are you guys doing @TeamYouTube?!""

YouTube: The Grinch Who Stole Cryptomas

Dunn hasn’t been the only YouTuber affected by the platform’s sudden ban. On Dec. 24 — Christmas Eve — Robert Beadles, host of YouTube channel Crypto Beadles with over 89.3 thousand subscribers, tweeted that YouTube had shut him down temporarily.

“Hey peeps! @YouTube @YTCreators has shut us down for a while. Guess free content and never taking a penny for any content is bad? We’ll post on my Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram going forward all accounts are under Robert Beadles there. God Bless #censorship #youtube #bitcoin”

While it appears that the Crypto Beadles YouTube page is up and running again, some influencers haven’t been as lucky.

YouTuber Ivan on Tech, whose channel has more than 210,000 subscribers, has also been affected by the ban. His account received one strike and he has set all of his videos to private ""as a precaution."" He told Cointelegraph:

“This is an attack not only on crypto, but on the entire notion of free speech. Centralized platforms have become way too big and powerful for their own good and their deplatforming is the reason decentralized platforms will conquer.”

A Tweet sent out on Dec. 24 by Omar Bham (@crypt0snews) shows an updated list of all the YouTubers who have recently had their crypto-related content banned from the platform.

Why Is YouTube Deleting Crypto Content?

YouTube has not yet released a public statement on why they are banning crypto-related content. The video giant, a Google subsidiary, did not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. This story will be updated if YouTube responds.

The lack of communication from YouTube has left influencers to speculate on the reason for the sudden crackdown.

Shortly after sharing the updated list of accounts that have been affected by YouTube’s ban, Bham tweeted that it seems YouTube is deleting crypto channels with links to external websites or exchanges listed in video descriptions.

“It seems that a reason why YouTube would have to go after crypto channels is any links to external websites/exchanges in video descriptions.”

Although this is an assumption, Bham may be onto something.

For instance, YouTuber Rachel Siegel manages Crypto Finally, a YouTube channel with 2.54 subscribers. Siegel told Cointelegraph that she has not been affected by YouTube’s ban on cryptocurrency-related content:

“I have not personally been affected by the apparent ban on cryptocurrency videos on YouTube, however, I think it is clear that this is some sort of targeted attack. Tech censorship has been getting a lot of public spotlight lately, and as we continue to grow as an industry I can expect we will continue to see more mass bans and crypto content takedowns.”

Siegel confirmed that she does not link to external websites or exchanges in any of her videos.

“I once referenced Coinbase, but took that down,” said Siegel.

Interestingly enough, while some YouTube channels have not yet been censored by the platform, reports continue to flood Twitter on channels that have been impacted.

@TheMoonCarl recently tweeted, “The YouTube purge has now reached my channel! One video from 27th of January 2019 ""broke the rules"" because it was ""Harmful and dangerous content"". Sure, #Bitcoin is harmful and dangerous for the banks, but this is just ridiculous.”

Before sending this tweet, Carl told Cointelegraph:

“I hope this is a mistake by YouTube, because if not, then this is censorship in its purest form. Big YouTubers have seen their videos deleted. These videos did nothing more than educate people about the power of Bitcoin. It’s only a matter of time until my channel is attacked.”

While crypto influencers are still unsure as to why YouTube is banning crypto-related content, the Twitter account @TeamYouTube replied to Bham’s tweet that showed an updated list of crypto influencer that have been banned from the platform.

The below tweet, which was posted 18 hours ago at press time, said that YouTube will be looking into the matter, with an update to come soon.

No further updates have yet been released from @TeamYouTube on Twitter.

Regarding the matter, Bham told Cointelegraph, “That thread with Team YouTube was the extent of any direct responses that I've heard of. Team YouTube last updated us by linking to the regular YT community guidelines, and a reminder that we can appeal videos with a strike. Several YouTubers appealed, and had their appeals rejected, with no clear reason again as to why the video directly violated guidelines.”

Will An Alternative Emerge?

Although YouTube is ranked as the second most popular social media platform, with over 1.9 billion users, crypto influencers are looking for other platforms to share their content. In particular, blockchain-based social media platforms are proving to be appealing to the crypto community.

For example, LBRY is a sharing platform that uses blockchain technology to allow users to publish content and get paid. LBRY helps its users monetize their published material with its built-in payment system.

Monetization is also a critical aspect for many YouTubers. Recent statistics show that a number of YouTube channels generate six figures each year, an amount that is increasing by 40 percent every year.

According to Bham, who has been uploading crypto-related content to his YouTube page since 2016, a channel hit with a strike such as this may be unable to livestream for up to 90 days, heavily impacting a user’s income.

“As far as income, even with a successful appeal, a channel hit with a strike may be unable to livestream for up to 90 days,” Bham told Cointelegraph. “This has happened to me, and plummeted my income, since I relied heavily on real time engagement for my shows.”

However, while LBRY offers a monetization system and a YouTube platform that lets YouTubers republish their content to the LBRY network, the platform is still not being utilized by many YouTubers just yet.

Naomi Brockwell, Host of YouTube channel NBTV, which has more than 30,000 subscribers,, told Cointelegraph that while she was not affected by the YouTube ban, she believes it is time to start looking at decentralized platforms like LBRY:

“I haven't been affected by the youTube ban yet, but I would just add that we've had alternative decentralized platforms like LBRY for a long time with limited support from youtubers. Hopefully this is a wakeup call.”

However, some YouTubers who use decentralized platforms like LBRY have pointed out that their audience is limited on these channels, as most already have an understanding about cryptocurrency and blockchain.

“In addition to YouTube, many creators including myself are using decentralized content platforms such DTube, Steemit, Minds, LBRY, Bitchute & Bittube, explained Siegel of Crypto Finally. “While these platforms do solve the issue of censorship and takedowns of our content, it unfortunately still does limit our audiences. Meaning it limits everyday people from getting involved in crypto in the first place,”

Moreover, while audiences are still limited on emerging decentralized platforms, there are other challenges that still need to be addressed. Privacy rights, regulations, copyright protection and more must be resolved before serious YouTubers migrate their content to these platforms.

Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, chimed in on Twitter about the dilemma, saying, “It may be time the crypto community take a stab at its own blockchain-enabled sensorship-resistant social media platform. Lots of challenges though, spam, scam, trolls, incentives, copyright, token economics, governance, stickiness, privacy… But It’s about time!”",,https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/bitcoin-s-halving-is-about-to-shake-cryptocurrency-markets/5214239.html,"

If you are not someone following the ups and downs of bitcoin, you probably have not heard about a big event next year. It is called the “halving.” It will cut creation of the cryptocurrency by 50 percent.

A cryptocurrency is any form of money that exists online and operates without a central bank. Bitcoin is one of several such currencies.

No one person or group is in control of this halving process. It is a rule written into bitcoin’s computer program by its creator Satoshi Nakamoto more than 10 years ago.

The event is expected in May of 2020. It would cut by 50 percent the number of new bitcoins given to bitcoin miners. These miners create the world’s supply of cryptocurrency by solving complex mathematical questions.

The halving represents a big change in a market worth about $120 billion. Bitcoin worth several billion dollars are created every year.

Bitcoin market players are predicting sharp price increases as well as sharp drops in the value of the cryptocurrency. Such moves have happened in earlier halvings, which take place about every four years. The point of a halving is to keep down the number of bitcoins and control inflation.

There are likely to be winners and losers. So, those who buy and sell bitcoin are trying to predict the future of the cryptocurrency markets.

“This is the biggest question right now for most of the industry,” said Eyal Avramovich. He is chief executive of MineBest, a Poland-based company that mines bitcoin.

The drop in bitcoin’s production is one reason why the digital currency has not been accepted by established financial markets and organizations. Its future value is decided by technology and not, some say, by the rules of economics.

The rules of economics say that if supply is cut and demand stays the same, prices rise. The Reuters news agency spoke with seven cryptocurrency traders who said that the halving will lead to greater price volatility. They added that since the cut in supply is expected, the price may slowly rise or fall before the cut is made.

Making money from price swings

Bitcoin miners use modern, high-tech computers to compete against other computers in the cryptocurrency world. They are working to add new “blocks” to the blockchain ledger that supports the cryptocurrency.

Blockchain is the name of the system that records cryptocurrency creation, buying or selling. The system rests with many computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. It is believed that the network protects cryptocurrencies from attack and other financial crimes.

Bitcoin miners receive a set number of bitcoin, currently 12.5. The next halving will take place in May, when the number will drop to 6.25.

The two past halvings took place in November 2012 and July 2016. In the one year periods that followed, bitcoin’s value rose close to 80 times in 2012 and four times in 2016.

It is not clear how much of these price increases resulted from the halving. There may have been other influences.

Jeff Dorman is with Arca, a U.S. investment company specializing in cryptocurrency. He says bitcoin markets look like they will rise and fall during and after the halving event.

Such volatility in bitcoin markets is usually good for traders who work in the high-tech cryptocurrency industry because they can profit from a small change in price.

“For us, the event will be positive because it will cause activity in the market,” said Ha Duong. He is a cryptocurrency investor in Berlin who works for a large trading company.

Miners, however, hold large amounts of bitcoin. They do not want volatility. They want a leveling of prices, which enables them to invest in the newest computer technology to earn more bitcoin.

Every year, Bitcoin faces a new foe intent on crippling it by undermining the foundations it was built upon. From mining cartels to developer disputes, Bitcoin has faced a barrage of threats over the past decade. When it’s not internecine conflict taking its toll, it’s external forces including politicians and regulators seeking to exert control. In 2020, the cryptosphere will face one of its toughest challenges yet as the KYC war heats up.

The Battle Lines Have Been Drawn

This year, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued strict new global standards for crypto assets. In 2020, the guidance will begin to come into force, while in January the EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) kicks in. The upshot of this is more Know Your Customer (KYC) enforcement, stricter controls on buying and selling cryptocurrency, and increased compliance. Bad news for bitcoiners, in other words, who value their privacy.

The threat placed by the incoming legislation doesn’t just strip individuals of their right to anonymity, either – it also strips business owners of their livelihoods. Crypto payment service Bottle Pay, mining pool Simplecoin, and interactive bitcoin faucet Chopcoin have already been forced to shut down ahead of AMLD5. As news.Bitcoin.com reported:

Providers of crypto-related services, such as exchanges and custodial wallets, are considered “obliged entities” and will have to comply with the union’s AML regulations in the future. That means abiding by the rules applicable to other financial institutions including the obligation to perform customer due diligence and submit suspicious activity reports. That also applies to investment firms, tax advisors, accountants, notaries, and lawyers who transfer or receive payments equivalent to €10,000 and more.

A Global Problem

Encroaching KYC isn’t just a European Union problem: it’s a global one, as former fly-by-night exchanges start cleaning up their act and enforcing KYC to appease regulators, as they eye global expansion. Binance, which now operates multiple exchanges in various territories, has come under fire after its Singapore platform threatened to suspend a user for withdrawing to a coin mixing service. The backlash forced Binance CEO CZ to publish an AML explainer, but critics weren’t impressed, with one dubbing it a “statement by @cz_binance about how he is forced to boot-lick the local extortion gang by harassing his clients.”

Given that Binance and Huobi both operate out of Malta, there is speculation that the pair may be forced to enact blanket KYC to all users in the near future. At present, Binance’s main exchange enables withdrawals of up to 2 BTC without KYC provided its AML systems haven’t flagged the transaction as suspicious. Binance Singapore’s zero-tolerance policy for contraventions of its compliance standards is widely seen as the shape of things to come for every major exchange.

In ""Mars Attacks"" the Martians keep saying, ""WE COME IN PEACE"" as they disintegrate everything with ray guns. It's like Bitcoin companies sloganeering like revolutionaries when they're KYC enforcing, account closing, key custodying wannabe banks with a shiny face. What a joke! pic.twitter.com/3qdNOVPODI — Beautyon (@Beautyon_) December 21, 2019

Maximalists Protest ‘Surveillance Exchanges’

Bitcoin maximalists, generally defined as hardcore bitcoiners who have short shrift for altcoins and anything else that falls outside their narrow interpretation of what Bitcoin should be, have bitterly protested the creeping KYC that has permeated the industry. “Buy BTC, Coinjoin, put it in your wallet, STFU & HODL. F*** surveillance exchanges,” tweeted one.

“Now is the moment to show you are a bitcoiner! Avoid KYC exchanges! Use HodlHodl or Bisq! Coinjoin your UTXOs!” entreated another. Under the hashtag #coinjoinday, bitcoiners have scheduled April 5, 2020 – Satoshi Nakamoto’s stated birthday – for using Coinjoin en masse to mix coins. The move is reminiscent of the Shuffle Saturdays favored by members of the BCH community who use Cashshuffle for the same purpose. In addition, Proof of Keys day is returning on January 3, when bitcoiners are encouraged to withdraw their crypto from exchanges and store it non-custodially.

Last week, the Marty’s Bent newsletter reflected on the latest spate of invasive KYC:

Time and time again throughout Bitcoin’s first decade, we have seen exchange after exchange pop up that promise a service without any KYC/AML compliance only to attain a certain scale, draw the ire of regulators, and force the compliance restrictions on their users. Withholding their funds from them until they send a picture of their passport, a selfie, information about where they work, where they live, and all other types of data that will surely be stored in an insecure way. A nice, old fashioned bait and switch tactic that seriously invades an individual’s privacy and could be seen as a form of financial harassment.

The Next Bitcoin War Will Be Over KYC

In defense of crypto exchanges, they are obliged to follow the law in every territory where they operate, and are not immune to AML legislation. Nevertheless, it’s hard to shake the sensation that platforms are sometimes overreaching in their desperation to appease regulators. The biggest determinant of how the KYC war plays out next year may have more to do with the fate of initial exchange offerings and altcoins. If BTC increases its dominance, IEOs continue their decline, and the market remains bearish, there will be few incentives for bitcoiners to trade on ‘surveillance exchanges.’

Conversely, a new alt season could tempt even cautious hodlers to endure KYC and its privacy incursions in a bid to make more BTC through trading. Whatever way the markets play out, 2020 is set to be a landmark year for crypto and KYC. Will the industry kowtow to KYC, or will there be a drive towards decentralized exchanges and more privacy-friendly platforms like Utorg, local.Bitcoin.com, and Bisq?

What are your thoughts on KYC and ‘surveillance exchanges’? Let us know in the comments section below.

In 2011, Mike Caldwell created the notorious Casascius physical bitcoin collection, and since then the series of coins has become extremely valuable. Over the last two months, a bunch of people have redeemed their Casascius coins and on December 23 someone peeled a 100 BTC ($723K) Casascius bar.

2011-2013 Casascius Coins and Bars Sell for a Premium

Years ago, people made physical bitcoins and there’s been so many manufactured that there’s actually an encyclopedia that covers the subject. These days, however, there’s not as many physical bitcoin manufacturers as government regulations have stifled the industry. There are definitely a few creators still minting loaded crypto coins, but there’s nowhere near the number of physical coin makers as there was back in the day. Casascius coins are the most popular of all the physical BTC coinage ever created. Unfortunately on November 27, 2013, Caldwell had to suspend sales of all the items he manufactured that contained digital bitcoins. Throughout the Casascius manufacturing period, Caldwell minted coins and bars that contained 1, 10, 25, 100, and 1,000 BTC increments.

Casascius coins have always been in high demand and many have sold for a premium, well above the amount of BTC held on the metal. For instance, in April 2018, someone created a post on the shiresociety.com forum selling four 2011 Casascius coins for $10K per coin. Each of the coins sold on the website at the time contained a 1 BTC load under the hologram sticker. The price per BTC during the month of April 2018 was around $8k so the seller added a $2K per coin premium. On July 1, 2019, a 2011 mint-condition gold Casascius coin (MS65) that held 1 BTC sold for $99,000 on eBay. In November 2017, a Casascius physical bitcoin with a hologram error was purchased for $50K on the online auction site. In January 2018, another graded MS65 Casascius sold for $28.7K on Ebay.

100 BTC Casascius Bar Peeled

This week, on December 23, an individual peeled a 100 BTC Casascius bar currently worth $723K just for the BTC alone. According to data from casasciustracker.com, the Casascius S2-BAR-100 held 100 BTC and was created on February 4, 2013. In fact on Twitter, there’s a bot that tracks all the peeled (redeemed) Casascius coins and bars. The bot called @Casasciusbot recorded the last big peel, which saw a 25 BTC (S2-COIN-25) redeemed the day before.

100 BTC Casascius bar from 2013 was just peeled. 👀 https://t.co/7YX7HvirPT — Melik Manukyan ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️ (@melikmanukyan) December 23, 2019

In the last 30 days, the Casasciusbot has documented lots of coin peels mostly in increments of 1 BTC every few days. But there’s been plenty of higher denominations redeemed as well and many derive from the series 2 batch. The month of November saw 27 Casascius coins peeled worth approximately 71 BTC. 11 of those redeemed coins were from 2013 and the rest of the pieces derived from 2012 and 2011.

To date, there are 46,329 active BTC left on unredeemed Casascius coins and bars. There’s also been 44,940 BTC loaded Casascius-made products that have been peeled to date. It’s interesting to watch the timeline of people peeling these coins and wonder why they decided to redeem the funds now, especially when they might have more numismatic value in the future.

What do you think about the 100 BTC Casascius bar that was redeemed on December 23? Would you peel a Casascius coin or would you save it for a future date in time? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Cryptocurrencies have become valuable over the last few years and hardware wallets are now a mainstay within the cryptosphere. More recently, steel-crafted wallets that store crypto keys on a hard piece of metal have become increasingly popular. The following is a look at the wide variety of so-called ‘doomsday’ digital currency wallets fabricated from metal components.

The Steel Wallet Trend

Steel crypto wallets have become a popular form of storage in 2019 and there’s a slew of products crypto proponents can choose from today. News.Bitcoin.com reviewed a few steel wallets in the past that were created by the startup Cryptosteel. In January 2017, our newsdesk looked at Cryptosteel’s first iteration, which safely stores private keys, BIP39 compatible seeds, and secret cryptographic messages. In November 2019, news.Bitcoin.com reviewed the Cryptosteel Capsule, a steel cylinder device with 800 lettered tiles.

Moreover, Casa CTO and software developer Jameson Lopp has published his “Metal Bitcoin Seed Storage Stress Test” series, which covers steel wallet products extensively. People like the idea of metal-grade wallets that can last a long time and sustain critical amounts of damage. For instance, if a crypto holder’s home was on fire, an electronic hardware wallet or a paper seed would surely go up in flames. Steel wallets, although not perfect, can withstand a lot more stress and easily sustain water and fire damage. For example, steel can sustain heat temperatures around 2500°F, as aluminum can only withstand roughly 1225°F. Plastics have an extremely low melting point between 320°F and 410°F. Most hardware wallets today are constructed of plastic and aluminum components, which can be easily harmed by fire and water.

Crypto Key Stack

The Crypto Key Stack is a wallet that is shaped like a card but is manufactured with black anodized stainless steel that offers extreme fire protection. The startup claims the product can withstand fire heat up to 2200°F, which is twice the average temperature of a house fire. Users who purchase the Crypto Key Stack engrave their seeds with an electric engraver and the wallets are also waterproof and rust-resistant. The Explorers Stack product costs $70 dollars and it contains three blank mnemonic plates. The Crypto Key Stack comes with an engraver and plates can hold 24-word mnemonic seeds.

Crypto Keys

The $28 “Universal Key Package” made by Crypto Keys is another engravable wallet for mnemonic seed storage. Crypto Keys are also made of steel and the set comes with 13 double-sided keys, punch set, and stamping jig. The company sells a few different packages for different types of hardware wallets or mnemonic phrases. Each key is designed to store two words so 12 keys would be sufficient for a 24-word mnemonic. The 3D printed plastic stamping jig is used to align the letters on the metal key so the owner can punch set the words. Crypto Keys are durable steel pieces that can resist damage from floods and home fires.

Cyphersafe

The Cyphersafe Cypherwheel is an interesting looking steel wallet that stores BIP-0039 and SLIP-0039 private keys or other sensitive information. However, unlike the $70 Crypto Key Stack and the $28 Crypto Keys package, Cypherwheel has a hefty price tag at $200 per unit. But unlike the others, Cypherwheel can be locked with a padlock adding more security and it has the ability to store up to 96 characters. The metal wallet can withstand 2000 degrees of fire-based heat, and it’s also rust-proof and waterproof. Similar to the steel products mentioned above, Cyphersafe does carry a cheaper wallet called the Cypherplate which starts at $49.95 and has a unique numbered seal.

Steelwallet

Another metal wallet sold on the market today is Steelwallet, which is an offline steel backup tool that allows users to engrave a seed on two laser engraved sheets. Steelwallet packages are made of stainless A2 / ASIS 304 / SS304 steel and they can withstand fire, water, corrosion, and electricity. The two laser engraved sheets allow owners to store 12,18 and 24-word seeds or other types of encrypted secrets. The $65 Steelwallet package comes with a metal punching pen so customers can engrave their mnemonics. For a few dollars less, people can order two engraved steel sheets without the puncher.

Cryptosteel Capsule

The autonomous offline storage product called the Cryptosteel Capsule is a steel cylinder wallet that starts at $82. The capsule weighs 515 grams and there are 800 stress-resistant tiles included with the package. The shell is made of AISI 303 steel and has more than 99% coverage for hexadecimal strings up to 123 characters and random ASCII strings up to 55 characters. The company still carries the classic Cryptosteel Cassette products as well and they start at $92. Cryptosteel’s two steel wallet devices are also fire, water, and corrosion-resistant.

Simbit

The Simbit steel wallet uses a rail system so pre-made steel tiles can slide into place much like the original Cryptosteel Cassette. Simbit stores up to 114 characters and the package comes with 400 tiles to choose from. The product can withstand “prolonged exposure” to heat 600°F hotter than the typical house fire. Simbit uses 316 marine grade stainless steel alloy and because it uses this type of metal it is more corrosion-resistant than traditional stainless steel. One Simbit and 400 tiles cost $110 and the company sells packages of two as well.

Quadrat Register

The Quadrat Register is another cylinder-shaped metal wallet much like the Cryptosteel Capsule, although the Quadrat Register is far more expensive at $330 per unit and another $155 for the steel protective tube. Quadrat Register also offers two-point encryption because users can generate 128 different symbols or words and tether it to the GENESIS code list. Just like the other steel wallets mentioned above, Quadrat Register is fire and water-resistant as all the metal parts are made from German stainless steel.

A Myriad of Different ‘Doomsday’ Protection Features

There are many other types of metal wallets and products on the market today. Other variations can be made of metals such as iron and titanium, like the products sold by bulletproofbitcoin.com. Many long term holders appreciate the idea of extremely durable wallets, because they can withstand far more damage than a phone or electronic device. These benefits have invoked startups to create a wide variety of metal wallets that offer a myriad of ‘doomsday’ scenario protections such as shock resistance, higher melting points, and waterproof features. To some people, the steel wallet process seems extreme, but others wouldn’t use anything less than metal-grade products.

CNF takes a look ahead and has selected its top 5 Altcoins for 2020.

The Christmas season is not only the end of the year, but also the beginning of the time of forecasts for the coming year. In the crypto-community the question is which coins have the biggest potential for the coming year. In this article we therefore want to take a look at which old coins are most promising in 2020.

However, as the Crypto News Flash Team we would like to point out that the following information cannot be regarded as investment advice. We only share our thoughts about the crypto market. Readers are invited to form their own opinion on the contents of this website and to conduct their own research.

In order to select the top 5 Altcoins in 2020, we have tried to take into account all the important factors that can significantly influence the price of a cryptocurrency. From our point of view these are: acceptance, demand and price. The most important point from our point of view is the degree of acceptance.

Only if the project creates numerous use cases, for example through new partnerships, the price is likely to increase. In this respect, it should also not be ignored that news are a major price driver in the crypto market. Ultimately, acceptance but also demand will increase through the creation of new use cases. The price plays a role for many private investors in as much as “cheaper” coins are more affordable. New investors in particular start with smaller amounts and prefer the so-called “penny” coins.

Based on these factors, we have selected our top 5 Altcoins for 2020.

Basic Attention Token (BAT)

The Basic Attention Token (BAT) is trading at around 0.17 USD at the time of writing and could benefit even more from the growth of the Brave Browser in 2020 than in 2019. At the beginning of December, the developers of the Brave Browser reported an increase in active users to 10.4 million. This corresponds to a tripling of active users within one year.

The Brave Browser aims to revolutionize the online marketing industry and build a decentralized ecosystem that brings users, publishers and advertisers together and distributes the monetization of advertising revenue through the Basic Attention Token (BAT). If the number of active users, especially the number of publishers and advertisers, continues to grow as rapidly as it did in 2019, when a 12-fold increase to 340,000 publishers was achieved, the BAT price could benefit greatly.

The team behind Brave and BAT also speaks for the success of the project. With Brendan Eich, co-founder of Firefox and Mozilla and creator of JavaScript, the project is led by a strong personality. The project also has a prestigious list of investors, including Founders Fund, Foundation Capital, Propel Venture Partners and Pantera Capital.

VeChain (VET)

VeChain already caused a stir in the last two months. For a long time the Singapore based project flew under the radar of many investors. In recent months, however, the project has received increased attention, and not without reason. Since the mainnet launch of VeChain Thor blockchain, the team has been able to establish more renowned partnerships than any other project in the crypto market.

VeChain Thor blockchain’s use cases focus on digital business transformations in various industries such as fashion, wine, automotive, food safety, carbon emission reduction and agriculture. Partners include global corporations such as DNV GL Group, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the National Research Consulting Center (NRCC) from China, DB Schenker, Kuehne & Nagel, BMW Group and Renault.

Most recently, VeChain has entered into a cooperation with the Anhui Tea Industry Association in China, under which up to 670 Chinese companies from the tea industry can use VeChain Thor Blockchain.

So why could the big breakthrough come in 2020? China’s head of state, Xi Jinping, gave a speech in October 2019, which was widely acclaimed in the crypto community, in which he called for a major blockchain initiative. As the VeChain Foundation pointed out in a recent blog post, the focus is on the creation of value through the blockchain. VeChain corresponds to this standard, as it was stated in the publication:

The cooperation between VeChain and the Anhui Tea Industry Association is in line with the government’s goal to increase the competitiveness of all stakeholders in the industry through blockchain technology.

In this respect, China could become an important factor for VeChain if further use cases and partners in China will follow.

Cardano (ADA)

The cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA)created by Charles Hoskinson definitely belongs in the “penny coins” category at a current price of USD 0.03. Despite the low price, Cardano has great potential. This became apparent not least a week ago when the Incentivized Shelley testnet with stake pools was launched.

Within the first 48 hours, 240 stake pools were formed and over 5.4 billion ADA, about 17 percent of the total supply, were delegated. The launch of Shelley on mainnet is expected to take place in 2020. Then the participation in the Proof of Stake is likely to increase significantly, especially as exchanges such as Binance will also offer staking to their users.

Furthermore, Cardano has announced a major marketing campaign for 2020, which will be developed by the well-known agency McCann Dublin, which has already worked with Microsoft, LinkedIn and Norwegian Airlines, among others.

Chainlink (LINK)

Chainlink was already the biggest winner within the top 40 in 2019, as CNF analysed. With a price increase of 586 percent (until 15 December) since the beginning of the year, the LINK price recorded substantial growth. In June 2019 it was announced that Google is working on a project using Chainlink.

In detail, the tech giant wrote that it is working on applications that store cloud-generated data on a blockchain. To integrate the external data into the blockchain, the Google project used Chainlink. Chainlink also has SWIFT, Oracle, Gartner and IC3 as partners. In October, Intel, HyperLedger and EntETHAlliance joined the project to promote blockchain adaptation in the enterprise sector.

But why does Chainlink have great potential in 2020? In 2020, the topic of getting external data into the blockchain will become even more important. With its Oracle technology, Chainlink is well positioned to forge further strong partnerships and integrate into new services.

Ethereum (ETH)

Even though Ethereum as the second largest cryptocurrency by market capital is certainly not an insider tip and with a current price of around 130 USD is also not a bargain, Ethereum has a big year ahead of it. After slightly less than five years, Ethereum will enter the “Serenity” phase (or Ethereum 2.0). Even though the roadmap below (from May 2019) is no longer quite up to date, as the Istanbul hard fork and the Beacon Chain (Serenity Phase 0) have been somewhat delayed, it gives a good overview.

The launch of Ethereum 2.0 could be a strong factor in the price of ETH. Already in 2019, Ethereum has shown that it is still the number 1 smart contract platform. With the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, numerous strong partners and global corporations stand behind the project. For example, Microsoft launched a token-based reward program for the Microsoft Azure platform at ETH Blockchain in early December.

As Forbes reported, Ernst & Young, one of the world’s largest professional services companies, is investing in the development of data protection tools for the Ethereum ecosystem. The “Nightfall” project is, as Forbes writes, “a great example of how one day all companies will use the public mainnet for transactions with sufficient privacy comfort”.

One topic that has already dominated in 2019 and could become even bigger in 2020 is Decentralized Finance (DeFi). As ConsenSys recently stated in a report, DeFi has the potential to grow into a billion dollar industry. In this respect, there are numerous arguments for the Ethereum price to outperform 2019 in the year 2020.

The links between cryptocurrency and crime have long been documented. Silk Road’s infamous collapse after it was shut down by law enforcement in 2013, for example, highlighted how the technology was being exploited by criminals in the hidden corners of the internet.

Criminals use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for various purposes: laundering dirty money, scamming victims out of funds, defrauding investors, monetizing ransomware, or buying illicit goods. For years, reports have also suggested that well-known terrorist organizations such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda were using cryptocurrencies to procure funding.

Hard Fork has covered countless stories about cryptocurrency-fueled crime. We’ve also covered instances where law enforcement has successfully caught the culprits.

From our coverage, we can deduce that law enforcement’s success in catching the bad actors largely hinges on collaboration with fellow agencies and on using new technology. But sometimes the criminals help investigators by inadvertently doxxing themselves.

Charles Delingpole, the founder of ComplyAdvantage, a company that screens entities and monitors transactions, told Hard Fork: “The most famous mistake made by a cryptocurrency criminal is to de-anonymize oneself. When running Silk Road Ross Ulbricht did this by using aliases that were identifiable and traceable back to his real-world identity.”

Analyzing the blockchain

Unlike cash, which is completely traceless and anonymous, blockchain technology is pseudo-anonymous and behaves like an infinite, immutable, data ledger that houses every single cryptocurrency transaction ever made — but it also lets law enforcement agents trace and follow the money.

The fact that Bitcoin transactions leave a trace is not enough to deter criminals. We know that law enforcers aren’t able to immediately identify the parties involved in a Bitcoin transaction, but they can spot and study patterns in the movement of cryptocurrency to profile and de-anonymize suspects.

“The archetypal cryptocurrency crime is that of theft of cryptocurrency. This began with exchange hacks, as we saw with Mt Gox,” Delingpole added.

“The biggest crime, however, is the theft of savings from thousands of overly trusting millenials and libertarians who believed that somehow cryptocurrencies were a panacea for the failure of investments or the lack of wage growth elsewhere,” he noted.

Law enforcement agencies aren’t working alone, though. They are in fact actively collaborating with several specialized firms in the space such as ComplyAdvantage and Elliptic.

Based in London, and founded by Tom Robinson in 2013, Elliptic provides blockchain analysis services. In fact, when police in the UK wanted to catch a dark web dealer selling sizeable quantities of MDMA, they contacted the company.

“Our focus is on preventing money laundering rather than tracking down criminals,” Robinson told Hard Fork, adding: “To achieve this, we provide tools to businesses such as cryptocurrency exchanges and financial institutions, that allow them to screen cryptocurrency transactions for links to criminal activity.”

“By making it harder for criminals to launder their proceeds in cryptocurrency, we help discourage the illicit activity in the first place,” he said.

Elliptic visualization of the most active XRP accounts and the transactions between them.

Elliptic’s tools are based on blockchain monitoring. So, when a bank or an exchange screens a Bitcoin transaction through its software, the company is able to trace it back through the blockchain to see whether the funds originated from wallets associated with criminal activity — for example, a ransomware wallet or a dark web marketplace.

“This means that we have to continually collect data relating to cryptocurrency addresses associated with this illicit activity,” Robinson noted. To achieve this, Elliptic has a team of data analysts and uses several automated processes.

Of course, this is not as easy as it sounds. “The challenge we face is that not every cryptocurrency exchange uses tools like ours, and so there is always somewhere criminals can cash-out without being caught. The hope is that as anti-money laundering regulations are increasingly implemented, there will be fewer and fewer places that criminals can cash-out and launder their ill-gotten gains.”

ComplyAdvantage, founded in 2014, was born out of the frustration experienced by Delingpole, who previously worked as a money laundering reporting officer and lacked adequate resources to do his job.

“We [ComplyAdvantage] help file suspicious activity reports directly to FINCEN and other regulators around the world. We liaise closely with regulators to understand the latest patterns of criminal behavior and then ensure that our clients can then detect and prevent those typologies,” Delingpole told Hard Fork.

Similarly to Robinson, Delingpole was also open about the ever-growing challenges companies are facing in terms of preventing cryptocurrency crime and catching the criminals.

“The structural fundamentals of cryptocurrencies makes it very easy to facilitate crime. With legitimate flows masking illegal flows, it is very easy for criminals to launder money through cryptocurrencies.”

A new way of investigating

If you’ve been involved in Bitcoin for some time, you would have undoubtedly heard about Katherine Haun, the Department of Justice prosecutor-cum-cryptocurrency investor.

She might be best known as the first female general partner to join prominent VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and co-head of its $350 million cryptocurrency fund, but for years, Haun cut her teeth investigating prison gangs, corrupt officials, and the mafia.

However, approximately seven years ago, her career was sent in a new direction after a colleague at the DOJ asked her to look into a mysterious cryptocurrency.

“They said ‘we have this perfect assignment for you’ — there’s this thing called Bitcoin and we need to investigate it,” she told CNBC. “That was the first time I’d ever heard of Bitcoin.”

Interestingly, Haun said she thought of the cryptocurrency in the same way that she perceives cash: an enabler for criminal activity but by no means responsible.

“The government was able to use that same [blockchain] technology to actually track down criminal activity it might not otherwise have been able to,” she said. “Without the technology underlying Bitcoin, we never would have been able to catch those people.”

Her most extensive case to date saw Haun investigate white-collar crime and public corruption, where government agents were exploiting early adopters of cryptocurrency. One of the agents swindled approximately 20,000 BTC — which is now worth some $150 million — while another extorted Silk Road’s creator, and stole from other cryptocurrency investors.

Had that crime been committed in cash, Haun told CNBC, it would have been nearly impossible to track these people down.

Acknowledging the threat

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who owns the world’s biggest Bitcoin wallet, is no stranger to cryptocurrency crime.

Just recently, Christopher Wray, the agency’s director, said cryptocurrencies were “a significant problem that will get bigger and bigger.” In June last year, the Bureau said it had 130 active cryptocurrency investigations.

Then, in July, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating a task force that would in part focus on developing cryptocurrency fraud investigations.

The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL) is also working to keep cryptocurrency criminals at bay.

In fact, in early May, the agency supported Spain in dismantling a criminal organization providing large-scale crypto money laundering services to other criminal gangs.

A few weeks after that, the agency — alongside several other forces — clamped down on cryptocurrency mixing service Bestmixer.io.

Then, in June, more than 300 cryptocurrency experts from both law enforcement and the private sector attended the sixth Cryptocurrency Conference hosted at Europol’s headquarters in The Hague, Netherlands.

During the same month, Europol also declared its intentions to help authorities with the announcement of what it’s calling the “cryptocurrency-tracing serious game.”

“The Cambrian explosion of cryptocurrencies that we saw in 2016-2018 has abated. Anonymous cryptocurrencies like Monero and Dash which look like they were constructed to aid money laundering have seen their volumes reduce,” Delingpole said.

“But that does not mean that innovation has stalled – behind the scenes, the structural requirements for scale and mass adoption are being iterated upon. In order to mass adoption to occur, there needs to be more day to day adoption of cryptocurrencies by average users,” the entrepreneur continued.

“Cryptocurrency crime with this innovation and broader adoption, therefore, looks a lot like it does today: a mix of theft, blackmail ransoms, and laundering, albeit at a much larger scale,” he concluded.

Law enforcement is right to acknowledge the criminal threat posed by cryptocurrencies, and while the landscape is not necessarily set to change much, they will have to change and adapt if they’re to continue catching bad actors who will undoubtedly continue to exploit a technology that fulfills their objectives to near perfection.

Cash may still be king, but if criminals want to operate online, cryptocurrencies are their financial weapons of choice.",2019-12-26 00:00:00.000,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-gained-8-9-million-percent-over-the-last-decade/,"Bitcoin Gained 8.9 Million Percent Over the Last Decade

2020 is fast approaching and the last decade will be behind us. Throughout the last ten years, the biggest unicorn firms were born like Uber and Airbnb. However, even though Bitcoin isn’t a company, the best investment of the decade belongs to the decentralized cryptocurrency Satoshi created. In fact, Bank of America’s recent securities report highlights that an investment of $1 in bitcoin at the start of 2010 would now be worth more than $90,000.

Bitcoin: the Decade’s Best Performing Investment

This week, a great number of people are reminiscing about the last ten years and a slew of individuals understand that the advent of Bitcoin was quite significant during this period of time. “The most valuable startup of the last decade didn’t raise money, didn’t have employees, gave away the cap table, and let anyone invest,” said the popular philosopher Naval Ravikant. Besides Ravikant’s opinion, there’s data that shows bitcoin was the best investment during the last decade.

Bank of America’s recent securities paper explains that between 2010 and 2020, oil has weakened and “negative interest rates have been good for gold markets.” But if a person invested $1 in bitcoin in 2010, it would be worth well over $90k today, BoA’s report underlined. Because of bitcoin’s great performance record, the decentralized asset has surpassed every investment vehicle in the last ten years.

Some of the best performing investments of the decade. Happy New Year's everyone. *Bitcoin enters once publicly traded on Coinbase in 2012 pic.twitter.com/dBr5zH88XV — James Todaro (@JamesTodaroMD) December 24, 2019

Now let’s just say someone followed gold bug Peter Schiff’s advice and invested in gold in 2010, which was trading for $1,113 per Troy ounce at the year’s open. Ten years later, gold has done well for itself touching a high of $1,542 per ounce and that’s a fairly decent +38% gain. In the last decade bitcoin, however, has gained a whopping +8,999,900% and this year alone, BTC has outpaced gold’s market performance in the last ten years. In 2019, BTC has gained +96% compared to gold’s +10.8% increase.

Bitcoin Shined Without a Centralized Marketing Fund, No Salespeople, and No Roadshow

Besides precious metals, if Bitcoin was a company it also outpaced investments in the most profitable unicorn businesses created in the last decade. Profitable startups throughout 2010 and 2020 include Uber, Facebook, Airbnb, Snapchat, Spacex, Tesla, and Pinterest but an investment in bitcoin surpasses all these public stocks by a long shot. For example, if you compare the +8.9 million percent BTC gain to investments in Netflix (+4,177%), Amazon (+1,787%), Apple (+966%), Microsoft (+556%), Disney (+423%) and Google (+335%), numbers show there is no comparison. The angel investor and former CTO of Coinbase, Balaji Srinivasan, recently explained his thoughts about the cryptocurrency revolution during the last decade compared to the decade’s unicorn firms.

“As the decade ends, the biggest unicorn of the 2010s wasn’t Uber, Airbnb, or Snap — It was Bitcoin,” Srinivasan tweeted. “Please note that all three of these [companies] and many other unicorns are great companies — I take nothing away from them. But to my knowledge, nothing else founded in the same timeframe held at $100 billion for a longer time.” Srinivasan added:

From an investor standpoint, this is important to know.

A number of crypto proponents agree with Srinivasan and Ravikant’s statements about cryptocurrencies throughout the last ten years and the subject is often discussed on forums and social media. Replying to Srinivasan’s tweet, former Bitcoin Foundation director Bruce Fenton said:

[Bitcoin did all of this] without a centralized marketing fund, no salespeople, no roadshow people pitching sovereign wealth funds or family offices and no fundraise or premine.

Even though the digital asset was the best investment of the decade, it also provided significant innovation, financial disruption, and changed the way people perceive money. People can bypass corporations, financial institutions, and governments in a censorship-resistant fashion like never before. It’s safe to say that cryptocurrency innovation will make the next ten years quite revolutionary.

However, many of the YouTubers affected by the ban still have not had their videos restored on the site.

YouTuber Ivan on Tech told Cointelegraph on December 26th:

“Nothing has changed. YouTube said this was a mistake yesterday too. I’m not sure why they are saying this.”

Ivan on Tech’s YouTube account, which has more than 210,000 subscribers, received a strike from YouTube earlier this week. He has since set all of his crypto-related videos to private as a precaution.

YouTuber Carl The Moon also told Cointelegraph on December 26th that all of his videos are still removed from the platform, noting that he is not sure of the validity of YouTube’s recent statement.

“This was the first time I was punished by YouTube and I got a warning. When you have a warning, you will get a strike next time. After 3 strikes within 90 days, YouTube permanently removes your channel,” said Carl.

YouTube’s community guidelines do not address crypto

According to YouTube’s community guidelines, content is automatically removed if it violates the platform’s guidelines. This could include nudity or sexual content, harmful or dangerous content, hateful content, violent or graphic content, harassment or cyberbullying, spams, scams and more.

While this may be the case, crypto YouTubers have expressed confusion as to why their content is being deleted, a point of concern that YouTube has failed to clarify.

We do know that Alex Saunders YouTube channel, Nugget’s News, which has 64.6k subscribers, has been banned due to “harmful or dangerous content.”

Saunders posted in the r/ethereum community on Reddit 9 hours prior to press time that he woke up on Christmas to a strike warning from YouTube for posting “harmful or dangerous” content. Following this, Saunders received another strike in a matter of hours, even though he hadn’t taken any action since the first warning.

According to Saunder’s Reddit thread,

“Today I woke up on Xmas to a strike warning from YouTube for harmful or dangerous content. Checked my email, nothing. A few hours later after Xmas lunch, another strike. I hadn't even done anything on Youtube since the first strike. Still no email. I cover a lot of topics related to finance, economics, housing market, stocks as well as crypto related content. We don't do paid ICO or token promotion. I have done tutorials on leverage trading platforms. I'm really not sure what to do. If the trend continues most crypto youtubers will be affected.”

Saunders also tweeted 11 hours prior to press time,“Hi @TeamYouTube with over 100 videos removed & 2 strikes in 24 hours I have still not even received an email from you. This is really scary. We've hired new staff. I have a wife & baby to support. I can't fix the problem if I don't know what I've done or who to communicate with!?”

YouTuber Omar Bham, who created a list of well-known YouTubers affected by the ban, received a response on Twitter from @TeamYouTube on December 24th.

Bham told Cointelegraph that he has not heard any updates from YouTube since then:

“The extent of this is unknown. I keep hearing of smaller channels, not on my list, which have completely disappeared.”

However, Bham did tweet 5 minutes ago to press an update that YouTube has restored his one video that had previously been taken down:

“Update: YouTube has repealed my warning and reposted the video, which they had previously removed. Crypto YouTube is not dead (just yet, anyway).”

Two of the largest bitcoin mining chip manufacturers have plans to equip their products with 5nm chips in the near future. Just recently, China-based manufacturer Bitmain purportedly produced the world’s first 5nm test-grade bitcoin mining chip and more efficient mining rigs will see mass production next year. The firm Canaan also recently announced that the company will have access to 5nm semiconductors by Q1 2020.

TSMC’s 5nm Process Is Ahead of the Game

Last January, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported at its annual conference that the company’s 7nm node (N7) was operating under capacity. On top of all this news, next-generation computer makers, iPhone distributors, and bitcoin mining rig manufacturers sought 7nm chips in mass quantity this year creating massive demand. TSMC expected revenue to increase slowly in 2019, but the last two quarters saw better revenue performance than expected. Despite the issues with the company’s 7nm process, TSMC has continuously signaled confidence in its 5nm (N5) process roadmap.

In December, at the IEEE IEDM Conference, the firm discussed its 5nm process in high regard alongside Intel’s slideshow describing 2nm and 1.4 nm chips by 2029. TSMC noted huge differences between the 7nm and 5nm process as the 7nm yields just a touch below 100 million transistors per square millimeter (mTr/mm2). The 5nm technology has shown an average yield of 80%, with a peak yield per wafer of 90%. The Taiwan foundry’s 5nm test chips had shown a die size of 17.92 mm2.

Coming Soon: Bitmain and Canaan 5nm Equipped Bitcoin Mining Rigs

Following the details about TSMC’s 5nm process, two of the largest bitcoin mining rig manufacturers in the world revealed that they would soon be equipped with TSMC’s 5nm chips. Local reports from China disclosed that the company Bitmain Technologies has completed the first 5nm test-grade bitcoin mining chips. At the moment, Bitmain products use TSMC’s 7nm process for the latest 2019 Antminer versions. In October, Bitmain’s CEO Jihan Wu discussed the 5-nanometer technology at the World Digital Mining Summit held in Frankfurt. Various sources have said that Bitmain will be equipped with 5nm by early 2020 and products are set for mass production.

Following discussions concerning Bitmain’s upcoming ASIC rigs, regional reports revealed that Canaan will also have 5nm chips by the first quarter of next year. The 5nm chips will improve performance by 15% and the wafers will stem from the Taiwan-based semiconductor foundry. However, Canaan is a Chinese mining rig manufacturer that purchases semiconductors from both Samsung and TSMC. 8btc editor and reporter Vincent He stressed that Canaan was one of the first companies to reveal its 7nm test-grade mining chip before lots of companies announced use of the semiconductors. The report further detailed that the cofounder of Canaan said that the firm will “have a greater grasp of the supply chain and more capital investment after going public.”

The news of both Bitmain and Canaan steadfastly working to produce mining rigs equipped with next-generation 5nm chips shows how fast the mining industry is growing. With the 7nm process alone in 2019 mining devices have improved a great deal as far as efficiency is concerned. News.Bitcoin.com recently reported on how 2019’s bitcoin miners are 5x faster than predecessors. If it’s true that both companies are planning to produce 5nm equipped models in early 2020, then other manufacturers like Microbt, Innosilicon, and Ebang will likely follow suit.

From G20 Leaders Summit to Blockchain Global Governance Conference

Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), announced Monday that it is organizing Blockchain Global Governance Conference (BG2C) in collaboration with Nikkei Inc. The event will take place on March 9 and 10 in Tokyo. The FSA detailed:

As stated in the G20 Osaka Leaders’ Declaration under Japan’s presidency … within the international regulatory community, a consensus has been reached on the importance of engaging with various stakeholders in the decentralized financial ecosystem to ensure public policy objectives.

The Osaka summit, where the G20 leaders declared their commitments on a variety of issues including crypto assets, took place at the end of June. Noting that it has been working towards “attaining the concept of multi-stakeholder governance for decentralized financial ecosystem,” the regulator described, “As a cornerstone, BG2C aims at providing a neutral place for stakeholders to deepen mutual understanding and explore the ways to enhance cooperation.”

Worldwide Participants Welcomed

The FSA detailed that it has been conducting Multilateral Joint Research Project (MJRP) since 2017, with an emphasis on blockchain research in areas such as security, privacy, anonymization, and traceability.

“We also observe that potential blockchain deployments will extend to digital currencies and digital tokens as well as trade finance, supply chain and logistics, etc,” the agency continued, noting that “This conference will address the uses of blockchain in various business areas and will touch on the current business models, future applications, and underlying challenges to be resolved.” Japan’s top financial regulator elaborated:

BG2C welcomes participation from various stakeholders around the world including those who are active in open source software communities, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger etc., researchers from universities and relevant organizations, businesses in this space, civil society and financial regulators to discuss the better governance for decentralized financial ecosystem.

The regulator also holds international meetings called the Blockchain Round-Table (BCRT), with the participation of various stakeholders, financial regulators, and blockchain experts from around the world. The aim of this event is to “deepen the understanding of issues regarding the financial system based on decentralized financial technologies, using the outputs of MJRP.” A roundtable, held in March, was attended by global regulators, central banks, and other industry participants such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB), Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (Bafin), Banque de France, Dubai Financial Service Authority, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Monetary Authority of Singapore, U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, MIT Media Lab, and University of Cambridge.

BG2C will be held as a spin-off from a regular fintech meeting co-organized by the FSA and Nikkei Inc. called “FIN/SUM,” which has already been held four times. The latest one took place in September, where the FSA discussed “the current developments and growth inherent to Japan’s fintech” with the global community. The event aimed “to create a global eco-system and new form of cooperation and collaboration among various fintech stakeholders, in which Japan serves as a hub,” the FSA detailed.

Late last week, Binance’s Singapore arm threw crypto Twitter into a frenzy with reports that it had allegedly suspended one user’s account. The problem? That user, @bittlecat, had tried sending their bitcoin to the hash-scrambling Wasabi wallet in an apparent violation of Binance SG’s anti-money-laundering (AML) policies.

Binance SG refused to transact “directly or indirectly” with a variety of often illicit-tied crypto services, “especially darknet/mixer sites,” according to @bittlecat’s tweets of their email exchange with Binance SG support.

@bittlecat’s suspension was temporary. But if Binance SG’s anti-mixing policy holds – especially if it spreads to other exchanges – developers and observers say it could cut the crypto ecosystem in two.

“I think the exchanges are slowly coming to a crossroads,” said Gergely Hajdu, a developer with Wasabi wallet.

Users of privacy-enhanced wallets may find it ever-harder to move coins to and from regulated exchanges.

“Some exchanges may be completely foreclosed,” Hajdu said. “It will be so bad that I can’t express.”

On one side of this chasm: the crypto service providers embracing oversight from their local regulators and global watchdogs like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). And on the other side: privacy-conscious users, some of whom turn to shadowy-but-not-necessarily-illegal coin mixing services to shield what they hold.

“The big picture is more regulation is coming, and it’s gonna make this look, pretty normal in a couple of years,” said Tom Maxon, Head of U.S. operations for blockchain security company CoolBitX.

A regulatory sprint

Observers see this as one battle in the larger war to determine crypto’s direction.

There are the space’s early ideals, its proponents preaching as they did a decade ago, that bitcoin will bring privacy and financial autonomy to millions – irrespective of borders. Bitcoin, it was said, could be the decentralized answer to a world in seemingly constant consolidation mode.

Bitcoin could be traded peer-to-peer. Bought on exchanges. Shuffled between wallets (essentially digital bank accounts) that carried no personal identifiers. Mixed on services like Wasabi Wallet to make tracing it hard.

But that vision never sat well with governments. Nor with their regulators, wary of a financial instrument they could not control.

“Regulators are not comfortable with gray,” Maxon said.

And as millions – then billions – of dollars began flowing into bitcoin and other crypto assets, chief players around the globe began pushing for some way to regulate it.

The laws came slowly at first. Now, however, intergovernmental organizations like the FATF have set the world up for a regulatory sprint. FATF’s June guidance on a “risk-based approach for virtual assets and virtual asset service providers” gave financial regulators the world over a unified understanding upon which police the space.

FATF’s guidance hardly bans “virtual assets.” Nor does its global framework rule out “mixing services.” But it highlights their money-laundering risks, teeing up regional rule-makers for a crackdown on “obfuscatory” technologies that governments like Singapore’s have hinted at.

Maxon’s firm is developing a tool to help exchanges deal with the FATF’s travel rule, an outcome of the June guidance that pushes “virtual asset service providers” to share reams of customer data – much like the requirements traditional banks face. He sees the potential split as almost inevitable.

“The regulators are going to move this forward more swiftly than we’ve seen before,” Maxon said. “And then the ramifications, like these other services like mixers are going to be harder to use. It’s that kind of stuff that’s going to peter out over the coming years.”

Mixing in the gray zone

Mixing obscures the path one’s cryptocurrency takes; in the case of Hajdu’s Wasabi wallet, a Chaumian CoinJoin mixer scrambles multiple parties’ unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) into a nearly untraceable cryptographic mess. Put simply: multiple parties send their coins to multiple receivers in one transaction, making it hard to suss out who sent what to whom.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has not thrown out mixing entirely. Its webpage on the FATF guidelines does, though, say that virtual asset service providers should take careful note of “factors that could obfuscate transactions.”

But Binance’s global public relations head Leah Li said in an email statement that its Singapore exchange was following regulators’ lead.

“Binance SG operates under the requirements as set forth by MAS and our MAS regulated partner, Xfers. Hence there are AML CFT controls set in place for the Binance SG and the user triggered one of its risk control mechanisms,” Li said.

Casey Bohn, a law enforcement educator with America’s National White Collar Crime Center, said MAS’ hint-hint-nudge-nudge is more than enough for companies like Binance.

“From a corporate perspective, it’s a lot easier for me as a regulated money business to have a policy saying, ‘Hey man, we’re not going to allow this [activity] even though it’s perfectly legal because we don’t want heat from the regulators,” said Bohn.

Bohn said he believes the public has an inherent right to financial privacy. And though his cryptocurrency investigations often rely on the bitcoin blockchain, he nonetheless supports an individual’s desire to live off the map.

By the same token, he is skeptical that exchanges should be calling the shots over what’s permissible, and what’s not. He points out that right now an exchange has no way of knowing who controls a destined account once its user withdraws.

“Let’s say the exchange takes action against me based only on their assumption that the next wallet is still under my possession. Do we really want the technology corporations to be the arbiter?” he said.

Real-time tracing

Binance contracts with third-party service providers like Chainalysis to help it trace crypto transactions. These crypto-sleuths develop hefty tools to track asset movements; Chainalysis’ “Know-Your-Transaction” (KYT) software does so in real time.

Wasabi transactions have a “pretty unique” identifier that makes it “very easy to identify them in numerous ways,” according to Wasabi developer Bálint Harmat. But he insisted that his mixer, and others, are not inherently illegal. He also noted that Wasabi has reached out to Binance and Chainalysis to clarify the situation and prevent future issues.

A spokesperson for Chainalysis echoed that sentiment in an email statement.

“While mixers themselves are not illegal, we know that stolen funds from hacks and scams are often laundered through mixers. We recommend that our cryptocurrency exchange customers configure Chainalysis KYT to flag large transfers or high-velocity small transfers from mixers for further investigation because it could prevent criminals from cashing out stolen funds.”

Regulatory gears are already moving in radically anti-anonymity directions. Maxon, the CoolBitX executive, said FATF’s travel rule will have the most visible and immediate repercussions. Exchanges, he said, will develop user-filled forms built into their interface.

“Who are you sending this crypto transaction to? What is their name? What is their account number on that exchange?” he said, illustrating how those forms will appear.",2019-12-26 15:23:12+00:00,https://www.accountingtoday.com/opinion/what-the-new-irs-cryptocurrency-guidance-means-for-tax-professionals,"In October, for the first time in more than five years, the IRS released further cryptocurrency tax guidance . On top of this, a new cryptocurrency question was added to 1040 Schedule 1 asking all taxpayers: “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

What does this mean for tax professionals? In short, all tax preparers will now have to ask their clients whether they have any cryptocurrency related activities during the year. This also means that tax preparers must be ready to handle cryptocurrency taxation for their clients.



How does the IRS treat cryptocurrencies for taxes?

Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are not taxed outright. In other words, simply owning bitcoin doesn’t create a tax liability. Rather, it’s the gains and losses that you incur when buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies which ultimately need to be reported on your tax return.

Boiled down, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes, not as currency. In this sense, buying and selling cryptocurrencies triggers capital gains and losses reporting requirements just as they would for buying and selling stocks, another form of property.

For example, if you purchased 0.1 Bitcoin for $1,000 in January of 2019 and then sold it two months later for $3,000, you have a $2,000 capital gain. You report this gain on your tax return, and depending on what tax bracket you fall under, you will pay a certain percentage of tax on the gain. Rates fluctuate based on your tax bracket as well as depending on whether it was a short term vs. a long term gain.

What does increased IRS enforcement mean for your tax practice?

It’s no secret that a large percentage of people who trade and invest in cryptocurrencies have not been reporting nor paying taxes on their gains. I see this first hand with the thousands of users who come to us here at CryptoTrader.Tax and work to amend two or three years worth of tax returns. This general lack of compliance is going to come to a screeching halt with this new Schedule 1. Crypto investors will no longer be able to claim that “they weren’t aware” of the fact that their crypto transactions were taxable. This new question is going to dramatically increase tax compliance.

This increased scrutiny creates both an opportunity and a threat for your tax prep business. The opportunity is clear: if your firm is able to effectively help cryptocurrency investors, traders, and users easily and accurately report their crypto income on their tax return, you will be able to acquire premium clients at a high rate. On the other hand, if you are unable to assist your existing clients who must check “yes” to investing in cryptocurrency on their 1040 Schedule 1, you are at risk of losing them.

How can you prepare to service crypto clients?

Before you can start assisting the millions of crypto investors out there who are going to need to file their crypto activity, you need to educate yourself on the world of cryptocurrency taxation. There is a wealth of material online that you can get started with including the 2014 IRS guidance, the 2019 FAQ about virtual currencies, as well as other guides breaking down bitcoin tax implications.

On top of this, there are a variety of software companies out there that are focused on providing tools for tax professionals to help with the crypto tax reporting process for clients. It is wise to do you research and find the best options.

The increased IRS scrutiny towards cryptocurrency tax compliance presents a great opportunity to grow your tax business. Don’t be put off by the seemingly technical concepts that virtual currencies present. You do not need to be a technologist to grasp these concepts—a little research goes a long way.",2019-12-26 10:00:00.042,https://cointelegraph.com/news/japanese-financial-services-firm-invests-in-crypto-exchange-huobi-japan,"Japanese financial services firm Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings will invest about 500 million yen (nearly $4.6 million) in the Japanese branch of cryptocurrency exchange Huobi.

According to a press release on Dec. 26, the investment is part of a broader collaboration with Huobi Japan, wherein Tokai will acquire shares in the exchange. Tokai did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for details regarding the share acquisition. This article will be updated once more information is forthcoming.

Tokai intends to use the partnership with Huobi to promote new businesses in the areas of crypto asset exchange, initial exchange offerings, local currency issuance, and crypto management and storage services.

According to financial news website Financial Times, Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings reported a revenue of 57.57 billion Japanese yen ($252.5 million) over the past 12 months.

The firm stated today that its new partnership is part of a wider effort to adopt new and emerging technologies like blockchain as part of its business development plan.

Focusing on the far east

Huobi’s Japanese subsidiary Huobi Japan Holdings acquired a majority stake in local cryptocurrency exchange BitTrade in September 2018. The firm changed BitTrade’s name to Huobi Japan in February 2019 and continues to facilitate cryptocurrency trading.

Huobi is seemingly focusing its business efforts on the far east as it recently ceased the operations of its United States-based trading platform. The exchange explained that the local regulatory environment forced the firm to prohibit Americans from accessing its services.

In a Dec. 27 announcement on the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) website pointed out the risks of the resurgence of digital currencies, such as the escalation of crypto trading activities, digital currency mortgage provision and introduction of zero-interest loans, as well as serious violations of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) provisions. Signatory to the announcement were four Beijing-local regulators.

To address risks, the regulators issued a warning and called local authorities to combat cryptocurrency-related illegal activities in Beijing. The warning reiterated the Chinese government’s negative stance towards cryptocurrencies, stating that both legal entities and individuals cannot carry out virtual currency sales, investments or transactions, nor engage domestic or foreign agents to trade cryptocurrencies.

China’s crackdown on crypto

Recently, the PBoC enhanced its crackdown on cryptocurrency-related operations in the country. In a statement on Nov. 21, the bank warned that it was taking action against entities involved in trading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), which hit the crypto markets hard.

That same month, the city of Shenzhen revealed an investigation into cryptocurrency trading operations, again spearheaded by the PBoC. Industry leaders, including Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, nonetheless praised what Zhao saw as an effort to remove bad actors.

In late October, China voiced support for blockchain technology, but warned not to “speculate” about cryptocurrencies as blockchain should not be read as support for crypto. The People’s Daily, a publication under the direct control of the ruling political power, the Communist Party of China, wrote at the time:

“The rise of blockchain technology was accompanied by that of cryptocurrencies, but innovation in blockchain technology does not mean we should speculate in virtual currencies.”

In the meantime, the PBoC deputy director Mu Changchun said that the digital form of the yet-to-be-released yuan will be different to Bitcoin and stablecoins.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmex-cryptocurrency-exchange-holds-018-of-all-bitcoins-in-circulation,"BitMEX, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume to date, now holds 0.18% of all Bitcoins (BTC) in circulation.

According to daily historical records of BitMEX Insurance Fund, the balance of the fund has grown from 20,776 BTC on Jan. 1, 2019 to 33,449 BTC on Dec. 26, worth around $239 million at press time.

As such, the world’s top Bitcoin exchange now owns nearly 0.2% of all 18.1 million bitcoins mined to date.

BitMEX Insurance Fund is used to alleviate unfilled liquidation orders

The BitMEX Insurance Fund is used by the crypto exchange to avoid auto-deleveraging in traders’ positions and alleviate unfilled liquidation orders before they are taken over by the auto-deleveraging system.

According to the firm, the growth of the fund provides a significant level of assurance to winning traders that they will be able to attain their expected profits, at the same time limiting the downside liability for losing traders.

Essentially, BitMEX uses its dedicated insurance fund to cover losses in case trading losses exceed traders’ deposits.

Crypto exchanges continue to accumulate Bitcoin

While the amount of Bitcoin owned by BitMEX continues to grow, there is a similar trend on other major crypto exchanges including major crypto exchange Binance. As reported by Cointelegraph, as much as 7% of the entire circulating supply of Bitcoin was held in the wallets of eight cryptocurrency exchanges in October 2019.

Four financial regulators in China have jointly issued a fresh warning regarding crypto trading activities in Beijing. The notice explains the reason for the warning and lists prohibited crypto activities, which have reportedly been surging as companies ramp up their blockchain promotion.

Joint Warning by 4 Chinese Regulators

On Friday, four Chinese regulators jointly issued a notice on the prevention of crypto trading activities in Beijing. The four regulators are Beijing Financial Supervision Administration, Business Management Department of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), Beijing Banking and Insurance Regulatory Bureau, and Beijing Securities Regulatory Bureau.

The notice begins by explaining that recent promotion of blockchain technology has led to increased crypto activities in China, adding that some platforms are providing crypto trading services to domestic residents and offering crypto products such as zero-interest loans. The notice emphasizes that these activities are “serious violations” of the “Announcement on Preventing Financing Risks of Token Issuance,” which was published by seven regulators in September 2017.

Among the seven regulators were the PBOC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. Their joint announcement on Sept. 4, 2017, led to the closing of cryptocurrency and initial coin offering (ICO) trading platforms in the country.

On Nov. 25, the PBOC published a financial stability report for 2019, stating that 173 domestic crypto trading and digital token platforms have “exited without risk.” Meanwhile, local regulators have also been implementing similar measures. The PBOC’s Shanghai Head Office recently issued a notice detailing its efforts in line with the September 2017 announcement. Other cities have also been increasing their efforts, including Shenzhen where local authorities have reportedly been questioning crypto businesses. There have also been reports of Guangzhou’s regulators taking a similar approach.

Prohibited Activities

The notice issued by the four regulators in Beijing on Friday explains that various regulators have continued to “maintain high pressure” on activities involving cryptocurrencies and ICO transactions. They employ methods such as “on-site interviews, administrative investigations, website closures, and criminal case filing to combat them,” the notice describes.

The regulators further warned that “institutions and personnel in Beijing that carry out related activities shall not publicize and promote relevant virtual currency projects or platforms.” Other prohibited activities are conducting crypto business transactions, engaging in crypto transactions with investors, and engaging in domestic and overseas token issuance or trading activities. Furthermore, the notice emphasizes that financial institutions and non-bank payment businesses cannot provide any crypto-related services.

Since President Xi Jinping advocated for blockchain technology and said that China should expedite the development of this technology as the core for innovation, many Chinese companies have been promoting the technology for use in their businesses. This week, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange launched a blockchain index comprising stocks of the largest 50 publicly listed companies with blockchain ventures.

The man claiming to have invented bitcoin says he doesn't know where the key to his fortune is, and a recent court ruling called for him to forfeit $3 billion worth of his holdings.

Craig Wright, the purported creator, told Bloomberg he ""cannot be certain that information will in fact arrive"" to prove his claim to the bitcoin fortune.

Earlier in 2019, a judge ruled that the late Dave Kleiman owned half of the coins Wright mined through 2013, and that Wright must forfeit that half to Kleiman's estate.

Watch bitcoin trade live here.

The man who claims to have invented bitcoin may not be able to give up $3 billion of his crypto riches for a court ruling because he doesn't know when he'll have access to the coins, Bloomberg reported.

Craig Wright, the alleged creator, told Bloomberg in a statement he ""cannot be certain that information will in fact arrive"" to prove his claim to the assets.

Wright was ordered earlier in 2019 to surrender the crypto sum after a judge ruled he owned only half of the coins he mined through 2013, according to Bloomberg. The late Dave Kleiman held the rights to the other half of the fortune, US Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled, adding that Wright has no legal claim to that portion of the mined cryptocurrency.

Each half of the sum was worth as much as $4 billion, Bloomberg reported, but the price of bitcoin has since fallen.

Many in the bitcoin community don't believe Wright created the coin, with some even claiming he doesn't own as many as he claims to, Bloomberg reported. Others are worried that, should he forfeit the multibillion-dollar sum, bitcoin's value could be affected.

Wright added that he never said the ""private keys"" to the other half of the bitcoin fortune would be available or used in January.

""I do not intend to dump my family's BTC as some people suspect or want, as this would hurt many people in the industry,"" Wright said in the statement to Bloomberg.

The judge found ""clear and convincing evidence"" that Wright's encrypted bitcoin trust file doesn't exist and that his testimony was ""intentionally false,"" Roche Freedman lawyer Vel Freedman, representing the Kleiman estate, told Bloomberg in an email.

The lawsuit is ongoing.

Bitcoin traded at $7,212.08 per coin at 2:50 p.m. ET Friday, up about 93% year-to-date.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.

Since Bitcoin arrived in 2009, there has been growing economic and ideological interest in perfecting money that is native to the internet, and its popularity has sparked thousands of iterations. Blockchain-based digital money was indeed supposed to make our financial systems more free, fair and transparent. But where visionaries saw improvements over traditional finance, criminal enterprises saw opportunities.

Sure, the traditional financial system is regularly used by traffickers and terrorists, but cryptocurrencies have some attributes that are especially attractive for illicit activity. Unlike payments through banks, blockchain-based transactions settle in a matter of minutes. There's no central authority to handle disputes, and transfers are irreversible. One currency can be rapidly traded for another. Security company CipherTrace notes that while only a fraction of Bitcoin transactions is used for crime, it's also true that ""nearly all dark market commerce is transacted in cryptocurrencies.""

One key area that has been repeatedly attacked are cryptocurrency exchanges, companies that allow customers to purchase and trade different types of digital assets. They ""handle the money,"" so they have the most sensitive role . Despite that, these businesses are notorious for the shady practices they enable, like insufficient verification of listings, abusive trading activity and rampant conflicts of interest. Cryptocurrency exchanges are rife with fraud and constantly being hacked. While this has led to many lost fortunes, there's far more than money at stake.

Take North Korea. A March report from the United Nations Security Council found that Kim Jong Un and the North Korean regime have been exploiting vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency exchanges to evade sanctions and fund their military ambitions. So far, it's been a huge success. Between January 2017 and September 2018, state-sponsored hackers have stolen $571 million worth of tokens from cryptocurrency exchanges across Asia, according to one estimate cited in the UN report.

North Korea is not the only rogue state looking to leverage cryptocurrencies. Venezuela had explored creating its own cryptocurrency to bypass sanctions imposed by the United States.

Fighters around the region are using cryptocurrency to fund attacks, purchase weapons, obtain equipment and support their families. Elliptic , a company that develops tools to track how cryptocurrencies are used in criminal activity, has found that Hamas, the Palestinian fundamentalist militant organization, has deployed a method to make some of their donations nearly untraceable by providing each visitor a different Bitcoin address to send payments to.

Staging a terrorist attack can cost as little as a few thousand dollars. With cryptocurrencies, that sort of money can be raised almost instantly by scamming users, attacking businesses or manipulating financial markets. For a state-sponsored hacker with nearly unlimited resources, the potential earnings can be far greater.

Blockchain entrepreneurs and developers now need to develop and adopt the guardrails, protections and the oversight necessary for a global financial system. That means learning from the existing financial system while still embracing the security advantages unique to blockchain. Banks can be greedy and ineffective, but they have built complex and reliable ways to build, test and maintain systems that are worth emulating. With a cultural focus on reducing risk, these institutions have clear guidelines, train employees extensively and strictly adhere to compliance laws.

Most blockchains allow you to build policies and rules in the data, which requires a more thoughtful strategy, but can be used to prevent problems and create a system that is capable of correcting itself. Entrepreneurs should develop a set of standards, limits and restrictions directly into the function of the blockchain itself. This could include mandating advanced forms of cryptography, building in insurance policies if data is misused, or setting rules for how updates can be made in the future.

Public policy groups can be helpful here by creating and disseminating clear procedures for the industry to follow. Most notably, The Financial Action Task Force , an intergovernmental organization, has produced guidelines on how cryptocurrency businesses should share the identity information of users who transact in their markets.

Heavy-handed regulation is not the way to go. But if developers fail to improve, governments will be forced to step in and take drastic action. That will likely lead to burdensome regulations, or worse, criminalization. In fact, US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker warned that if foreign financial institutions, including cryptocurrency exchanges, do not build appropriate safeguards, then the United States will work to make sure ""that non-compliant networks and fintechs do not survive.""

A much more aggressive policing approach appears to be on the horizon. Law enforcement priorities will outweigh the efficiencies and opportunities made possible by blockchain, constraining a promising field of economics.

Blockchain's greatest asset is the passionate community of developers behind it. But the work they've done to improve the world is now being hijacked by those who want to commit acts of violence and create instability. We need to fix this situation in order to move the industry forward. Without serious course corrections, a movement to create government-less currency is on track to become yet another tool for nations to undermine each other.",2019-12-27,https://news.bitcoin.com/as-fatf-regulations-galvanize-crypto-mixing-applications-are-targeted/,"As FATF Regulations Galvanize, Crypto Mixing Applications Are Targeted

Since the inception of Bitcoin, governments have tried to keep track of all the transactions taking place on the public blockchain. As the years progressed, authorities have shown a distaste for cryptocurrency mixing applications like Coinjoin. On Dec. 19, a Binance customer couldn’t withdraw his bitcoin because the exchange told him he used the mixing wallet Wasabi. Eventually, the customer got his funds back, but only after promising not to deposit to a tumbling wallet again.

Coin Tumbling Users Beware

The battle for cryptocurrency anonymity is upon us and governments are invading the very decentralized frameworks designed to bypass their so-called authority. Last Thursday, a Binance customer explained on Twitter that his funds were frozen because he was withdrawing to a wallet that mixed his UTXOs. “Bitcoiners be warned: this is what happens if Binance finds you withdrawing to Wasabi wallet,” the Binance client tweeted. The customer dubbed @Bittlecat said he wasn’t surprised to find out his transactions were tracked, but stressed that he was very concerned that Binance knew he was sending to Wasabi. After telling the public about the incident, Bittlecat said that he got his BTC back. “I got my [satoshis] back, but not without promising Big Brother I wouldn’t mix those UTXOs,” he remarked. Bittlecat added:

It is really sad that [Coinjoin] is seen as criminal activity, and I’m glad that we are discussing this.

Bittlecat’s tweet, of course, quickly made its way across social media and crypto forums, becoming a viral topic in a matter of no time. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) replied to Bittlecat’s tweet and disclosed that the exchange operates under regulatory guidelines. “Binance SG operates under the requirements set forth by MAS and our MAS regulated partner, Xfers. Hence there are AML CFT controls set in place,” CZ responded. “Not something for us to decide [and] I believe they have already reached out to you to clarify and explain.” The Wasabi user reacted to CZ’s response and said that he expected the CEO to “decentralise the blame.” “How does this regulation make sense, when Binance has already KYC-ed me?” he asked. “Mixing is not illegal, it’s privacy.”

Governments Dislike Crypto Mixers and UTXO Tumblers

A great number of crypto proponents believe that issues like the Wasabi/Binance problem are just the start of a large uphill battle for privacy. Governments worldwide and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) are preparing to crack down on exchanges after FATF galvanized the fact that the “Travel” rule will certainly apply to cryptocurrencies. For years now, governments have targeted tools like BTC mixers and tumblers (Coinjoin-based) to fight against so-called money laundering and terrorist financing. For instance, in January 2017, a group of officials from Europol, Interpol, and the Basel Institute on Governance met in Doha, Qatar and discussed the topic of crypto mixers. During the two-day event, participants attending the anti-crime focused conference had a slew of recommendations including dismantling crypto tumbler services. The Basel Institute’s press statement insisted:

All countries are advised to take action against digital currency mixers/tumblers. Such services are designed exclusively to anonymize transactions and to make it impossible for law enforcement agencies to detect and trace suspicious transactions. The existence of such companies should not continue to be tolerated.

Since then, law enforcement officials have taken action against digital currency mixers. Furthermore, a few online mixing services on clearnet and the deep web decided to shut down services in fear of criminal charges. For instance, after the takedown of the two darknet marketplaces Alphabay and Hansa, the extremely popular Bitmixer.io voluntarily closed operations in July 2017. Two years later, in May, the operation Bestmixer.io was seized by Europol and the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD). At the time, Dutch authorities accused the Bestmixer administrators of mixing 27,000 BTC. A month later, in June 2019, the BTC tumbling service Bitcoin Blender voluntarily bowed out and closed its operations.

After a number of digital currency mixer/tumbler services bit the dust, cryptocurrency developers have created in-wallet platforms that allow users to mix UTXOs in a noncustodial fashion. For BTC, there are popular mixing wallets like Samourai and Wasabi wallet and bitcoin cash (BCH) users have access to Cashshuffle. Moreover, BCH developers are improving Cashshuffle with a protocol called Cashfusion. Additionally, as governments and regulators have threatened exchanges who don’t comply with AML/KYC guidelines, a myriad of trading platforms have delisted cryptos with privacy-centric characteristics like monero (XMR), and zcash (ZEC). Officials from Japan pressured Japanese exchanges to delist privacy coins and a number of other international exchanges have dropped digital currencies that provide anonymity.

FATF Rules Will Further Disrupt Privacy Advocates and the Anonymous Crypto Applications They Use

People believe exchanges delisting privacy coins, law enforcement agencies cracking down on mixers, and the recent issue with a Binance customer using Wasabi is just more signals of a FATF-driven agenda against cryptocurrencies. Individuals and organizations knew big changes were coming after the June G20 leaders’ summit ended in Japan. At the time, G20 participants including leaders from the EU, U.S., Germany, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., and India reaffirmed that the FATF rules would apply to the digital currency ecosystem. By this spring of 2020, the whole cryptocurrency environment may look entirely different due to the FATF regulations and of course anything to do with privacy, like using mixers like Wasabi, will be frowned upon.

“The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime.” —Hassan Rouhani, President of Iran

Also Read: Crypto Confronts Social Justice Warriors

Hegemony and Muslim Resistance

Hegemony refers to the leadership or dominance of one country or group over others. A nation with the most powerful fiat and control of international banking can achieve hegemony through trade wars, financial sanctions or bribery (aid), and the flex of expensive military might. A dominant state is known as the hegemon. The United States has been the global hegemon for more than half a century.

The globe is rebelling. According to the bitcoin.com article “Iran, Turkey, Malaysia Discuss Creating Unified Muslim Cryptocurrency”, at the Kuala Lumpur Summit 2019 — a four-day event that began on December 18 — the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan “discussed the prospect of creating a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries. Rouhani proposed an Islamic financial payment [system] with Muslim countries trading in local currencies and the creation of a Muslim cryptocurrency to cut reliance on the U.S. dollar.” The Malaysian P.M. declared himself open to the “idea of a unified cryptocurrency for Muslim countries.”

Circumventing Established Superpowers

Muslim nations are not alone. Russia launched its System for the Transfer of Financial Messages (SFPS) in December 2017 as an alternative to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT). SWIFT is an identification-code network for international transfers that allows financial institutions to send data to each other in a standardized and reputedly secure way. SWIFT is the default global system for financial transfers, which has been called the central nervous system of international banking.

Although its messaging platform is based in Belgium, the U.S. exerts undue influence upon SWIFT. Consider the U.S. sanctions imposed late last year on Iran as a way to rein in its nuclear ambitions. Targeted Iranian banks were excluded from SWIFT access after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin threatened the SWIFT itself with sanctions if it did not comply. Without access, Iran could not easily pay for imports or receive payment for exports.

A state that incurs American wrath is vulnerable to economic sanctions through SWIFT. In response, the BRICS joined the Russian alternative to SWIFT—the SFPS, which is based on the ruble or the fiat of members, not on the dollar. (BRICS is an acronym for five emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.) Russia also reached out to China, Iran, and Turkey to integrate SPFS with their financial systems. Most significantly, some Russian banks have joined the China (or Cross-Border) International Payments System (CIPS) to facilitate economic transfers between the two.

The European Union (EU) has been crying for more financial independence from America. A headline in Deutsche Welle declared, “Germany urges SWIFT end to US payments dominance.” The article opened, “Germany’s foreign minister has reiterated calls for the EU to free itself from dependence on the US and adopting its own international payments channel is one way of doing that.” According to Christopher Bovis, professor of international business law at the University of Hull (UK), “The European Commission has been developing … a parallel system to SWIFT which will allow Iran to interface with European financial systems, European clearing systems, using the nominations supported and created by the European Investment Bank based on the euro.”

The SWIFT alternatives have stumbled on the road to realization, but they are moving forward. The day when there will be several default currencies is foreseeable. When this comes, U.S. hegemony will be cut off at the knees.

Over Half a Century of U.S. Financial Hegemony

U.S. hegemony is rooted in World War II (WWII), which ran from 1941 to 1945 in terms of America’s direct involvement. During WWII, America ascended to military dominance largely through developing the atomic bomb and demonstrating a willingness to use it. Of equal or greater importance was the ascendancy of the American dollar as the foremost fiat and reserve currency of the world; a reserve currency is one used by states for foreign exchange and usually preferred by institutions or individuals for international transactions.

1944 cemented the supremacy of the U.S. dollar. While WWII still raged, more than 700 delegates from 44 nations met at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in order to regulate post-war international finance. Officially labeled the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, the gathering became known as the Bretton Woods Conference. It established a system of institutions and procedures for the international monetary system, which persists to this day; the International Monetary Fund was created, for example. The U.S. dollar became the reserve currency, with the central banks of other nations maintaining fixed exchange rates between their currencies and the dollar — that is, buying or selling the dollar to regulate their own money supply and value. A “floating rate” later evolved.

Interestingly, the Soviet Union refused to ratify the agreement, saying the institutions it created were “branches of Wall Street.” Bretton Woods cemented America’s financial hegemony through the global post-war institutions that functioned largely as agents of U.S. power and policy, which explains America’s initial enthusiasm for them. The global agencies have experienced several decades of evolution, however, and they now often act against U.S. interests. America’s enthusiasm has declined.

America’s superpower status was also cemented by post-war policies such as the Marshall Plan. The Plan pumped approximately $13 billion into Western Europe, allegedly to rebuild the economies of shattered nations. ($13 billion is about $183.48 billion in 2019 dollars. Some historians place the original figure as high as $17 billion.) The Marshall Plan explicitly partnered with the anti-communist Truman Doctrine, which passed the U.S. Congress in 1947. This is where many historians date the beginning of the Cold War. It erupted into the Korean War (1950-1953) and culminated in the Vietnam War (1965-1973, American military involvement).

In his path-breaking essay, “Myths of the Marshall Plan,” economist Tyler Cowen exploded five myths surrounding the Marshall Plan, which was said to create a miracle of European revival. Myth #2 offered a glimpse of the Plan’s true face.

Myth #2: The Plan encouraged free enterprise and sound economic policy. “[Those] directing postwar U.S. foreign economic policy had strong interventionist sympathies; when faced with any problem, their instinct was to seek a governmental solution … Furthermore, the very structure of the Marshall Plan encouraged state planning.” In most cases, state regulation increased. The “West German miracle,” for which the Marshall Plan is credited, occurred only after the economic director, Ludwig Erhard, acted unilaterally and against American wishes to abolish most of the Allied economic controls.

With ownership of the world’s reserve printing press and control of the major European economies, post-WWII America achieved a dominance that endured into the 21st century.

Crypto is Anti-Empire, Anti-Hegemony

Competition is always desirable because it offers more choices to the individual. But a statist competition between global payment systems does not necessarily increase the financial freedom of individuals. The state — one state or another — remains in control of the wealth transfer; only direct payment or barter allows hands-on privacy and control.

In this, the blockchain is a game changer. Investopia explained, “With its distributed ledger and ability to enable transactions with minimal fees, blockchain poses a tangible threat to cross-border funds transfer systems … And none of those systems is more threatened than SWIFT, a consortium of banks that manages a bulk of global transactions.”

SWIFT itself is assisting in its own decline. In recent years, a series of SWIFT hacks have raised questions about its ability to protect money and data. The hacks led the investment bank Credit Suisse to post on its site, “Forget Bitcoin, but Remember Blockchain?” Credit Suisse stated its belief that “interbank payment systems are ripe for disruption. Interbank payment systems such as SWIFT are old, inflexible, slow, and increasingly prone to cyberattacks at a time when banks are under tremendous pressure to cut costs and protect customer data from hackers, which blockchain could achieve.”

Again, this solution solves nothing for the individual. If SWIFT is replaced by a major bank’s blockchain — a bank that functions as an arm of the state — then financial freedom is not advanced. This is evidenced by Credit Suisse’s praise of distributed ledgers as an efficient way to collect taxes, pay government benefits, issue permits and licenses, and create universal identification networks. But Credit Suisse’s acknowledgement of blockchain’s payment power means that crypto has caught the establishment’s attention, and it wants to harness crypto’s power to serve its own purposes. Credit Suisse’s rejection of free-market blockchain recognizes that Bitcoin is either useless for its purpose or a threat.

It is both. The state most often ignores the merely “useless,” however, and attacks threats. In a recent article, the Bulgarian journalist Lubomir Tassev asked, “Is the Dollar Era Under Threat?” Yes, it is. Crypto endangers the dollar and SWIFT in at least two ways.

First: a free-market blockchain vests financial control in the hands of individuals who sidestep the state. The state cannot survive being widely sidestepped. Its existence depends on stealing wealth and returning a small fraction of it as services that are either unwanted or more efficiently provided by the marketplace. As the power of individuals grows, that of the state declines. And the state is extremely good at one thing — recognizing an enemy.

Second: the blockchain payment system out-competes those of traditional finance that are controlled by the state and state-aligned banks. Tassev observed, “Decentralized cryptocurrencies have their own shortcomings if they were to be used as reserve or global currencies. However, many of these drawbacks can be attributed to their infancy. Take volatility for example, which has decreased significantly in the past year.” As the blockchain evolves naturally, the threat to traditional systems of control increases exponentially.

Conclusion

The stakes are high on both sides. Consider one aspect that is rarely discussed. The state’s financial monopoly allows it to equate wealth with fiat itself. The control is so great that people think about money and finances in statist terms.

Real wealth is not about money. Real wealth is: not having to go to meetings, not having to spend time with jerks, not being locked into status games, not feeling like you have to say ‘yes,’ not worrying about others claiming your time and energy. Real wealth is about freedom. —James Clear, author of Atomic Habits

Wealth is power, and this is a most excellent thing when it is used to pursue and express freedom. But freedom only occurs when individuals control their wealth, especially the return on their labor and capital. When the state controls wealth, then it benefits from the wealth through stripping away individual freedom. And there can be no greater control than to enter the mind of a person and define the terms in which he thinks of an issue. This is what happens when wealth is conflated with fiat. What would a house sell for? How much has the dollar value of gold risen? What is the price of a loaf of bread today? How much do you earn for your labor? What are you “worth”?

The conflation accrues to the state’s advantage. Clarity of thought is always individual, and this clarity is the basis of survival and progress. Few things are as clear as the fast flow of electrons over an immutable blockchain. It can literally bring down empires.

Ryan Zurrer is founder of Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm focused on on-chain opportunities. Previously, he led investments at Polychain Capital and served as Chief Commercial Officer at the Web3 Foundation.

Nation states made a more substantive impact this year than the 10 previous years of crypto combined. China’s statist approach, in particular, may prove to be a catalyst to the still-elusive “mass adoption of crypto.”

In the U.S., the SEC made headlines with several high-profile enforcements including EOS, Telegram and kin, while federal lawmakers made their presence felt regarding Facebook’s Libra. FINCEN’s KYC/AML guidance factored prominently, and token sales and SAFT rounds slowed in 2019, driving much of the fundraising activity towards exchange platforms and causing a short blip of popularity in IEOs.

Regulatory action may have caused deal flow to slow, U.S. entrepreneurs and investors say, even if Silicon Valley will continue to produce some of the most compelling innovation in blockchain. As the industry moves forward into bitcoin’s second decade, there will continue to be high-drama friction as we try to reconcile crypto-anarchist ideals of pseudonymous participation with long-standing regulations around securities, KYC/AML and money-transmission laws.

We saw cross-border collaboration around the FATF enforcement recommendations, calling for exchanges to share customer information. But it remains to be seen whether this mandate will affect exchange activity or if it will drive a renaissance in decentralized exchange volume in 2020.

During the first three quarters, we saw China step forward and embrace blockchain technologies. The People’s Bank of China announced plans for a national sovereign digital currency, the DCEP. Industry observers and PBoC’s development team expect it to launch in 2020. President Xi Jinping’s comments regarding China’s desire to lead in blockchain technology were almost certainly strategically timed on the back of the Facebook hearings.

China’s leadership in our industry has been playing out for some time. More than two-thirds of bitcoin mining happens in China and exchange volume is dominated by Chinese markets (for example, more than 60 percent of Tether trading). Most importantly, more consumer-facing Web3 apps are coming out of China than any other market globally. At the time of this writing, eight of the top 10 dapps are developed by and/or for the Chinese market.

While Western crypto purists continue to point to concerns over privacy and surveillance of the DCEP, this is an overly simplistic evaluation in my opinion. I am confident Chinese ingenuity will lead towards a myriad of relatively seamless bridges between high-privacy crypto-networks and the regulated DCEP. I estimate the DCEP most directly impacts Chinese demand for Tether and other stablecoins going forward.

After years of waiting patiently in vain for “mass adoption of crypto,” I think we should be open-minded here.

The Chinese market also drove much of the bitcoin and ethereum market rebound in the first half of the year as Chinese investors sought to diversify their personal stores of value amid their nation’s trade war with the U.S. Enormous scams like the multi-billion-dollar Plus Token embezzlement caused regional governments to take a stronger stance on exchanges, driving down prices and showing China’s influence on crypto markets. Chinese officials are in the “blockchain not bitcoin/tokens” camp, but recognize crypto’s market popularity. It seems like many sovereigns are trying to reconcile the power and potential of blockchain technologies with unsettling risks.

Chinese consumers have a certain affinity for foreign crypto projects, possibly due to perceptions around security, privacy and technical prowess. But 2020 will bring forward the first crop of technically sophisticated mainland-based projects. Local startups have evolved beyond the early fast-follower experiments into a new generation of very legitimate technical teams with novel crypto-economic models (for example, Nervos, Sperax, Bihu).

Crypto may be remembered as one of the first industries (but certainly not the last) where China takes the position of technical innovator rather than fast-follower, sitting at the vanguard of development in Web3 technologies. In fact, we may even look back on the DCEP as a harbinger of China’s strategic shift towards reserve-currency status.",2019-12-27 18:04:31+00:00

It’s now possible to use prepaid cards to buy cryptocurrency at many of the major exchanges. The fees charged tend to be higher than for bank transfers, but there are several reasons why some people are turning to prepaid cards.

If you’re thinking of buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another digital currency with a prepaid card, read on to discover the steps you need to go through.

What is a prepaid card?

Prepaid cards, also known as everyday cards, work in a similar way to a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. You load them with cash when you first buy them and top them up when the cash starts to run out.

Unlike a credit card, a major advantage of a prepaid card is you can’t run up debts on them. They only allow you to buy goods or services with the money you actually own. This makes them a useful budgeting tool and it means you don’t have to go through a credit checking process when you apply for one.

Another benefit of not having a credit facility is that if you fall victim to a scam, your losses are limited to the amount of money on your card.

Prepaid cards that have the MasterCard or Visa logo on them can be used anywhere that accepts these card scheme networks.

Why use a prepaid card to buy crypto?

A bank transfer is generally considered the best way to buy crypto because the fees are cheaper and it carries less risk than paying by card. For some people, however, paying by card is an easier and more convenient option.

Using a card enables you to buy crypto instantly, whereas with a bank transfer it can take around three to five days for the crypto to reach your account.

Many crypto exchanges accept traditional debit and credit card payments, but these have their drawbacks. Buying cryptocurrency with a credit card is an especially risky strategy.

According to a survey by LendEDU, more than a fifth of investors who used a credit card to buy Bitcoin didn’t pay off their purchases straight away.

Planning to use profits from Bitcoin – or any other cryptocurrency – to pay off a card balance is risky because there is a high chance the value of Bitcoin will plummet.

Equally, many banks offer overdraft facilities alongside debit cards, which means you can essentially use them like a credit card by borrowing from the bank.

A prepaid card enables you to buy crypto with a card but without the risk of spending more money than you have and being unable to pay it back.

How to use a prepaid card to buy crypto

There are lots of cryptocurrency exchanges that enable you to buy crypto with a prepaid card.

The process is pretty much the same as buying crypto with a debit or credit card – you just need to make sure you’ve loaded your prepaid card with sufficient funds.

When you’re comparing exchanges, one of the main things to look out for is how much they charge for card purchases. Fees are typically between 4% and 5%, whereas with a bank transfer, the fee could be less than 1%.

Once you’ve selected an exchange, the first step is to download and install a wallet that supports your chosen cryptocurrency.

You’ll then need to register for an account at the exchange – a process which will most likely include providing ID documents to prove it is you.

Once you’re registered, you can select your preferred payment method option – in this case credit/debit card – and add your prepaid card. It’s worth noting that some exchanges don’t support cards without an associated billing address.

When your card is added, you can then buy your chosen coins using the cash on your prepaid card. It’s important to withdraw your crypto and transfer it to your digital wallet to keep it safe and secure.

Conclusion

Using a prepaid card isn’t the cheapest way of buying cryptocurrency, but it’s an appealing option for those seeking a fast, simple, and convenient method of making purchases without spending more money than you own.",2019-12-28 13:00:25+00:00,https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-crypto-signs-symbols/,"Share this article

In theory, it should be easy to choose a cryptocurrency sign. Countless fiat currencies have popularized a single style — a letter with one or several strike-through bars, which should represent the stability of the currency. It’s a design that has been used all around the world: signs for the euro, the pound, the yen, the franc, and the dollar can all be instantly recognized by almost anyone.

Yet it’s not so easy to follow that style in the cryptocurrency world. Hundreds of different crypto projects are competing over similar identities, which led many parts of the industry to overlook all but the most popular symbols. Nevertheless, many crypto projects are pushing for recognition with various strategies — here’s who they are.

Bitcoin Borrowed a Currency Sign

Bitcoin’s ₿ symbol is undeniably the most recognizable crypto sign. It’s an original design that has been part of Bitcoin’s logo since 2010, and it was finally added to Unicode in 2016. This made it easier for users to type (or copy and paste) the character.

Naturally, ₿ is used by exchanges and market aggregators, but it has been integrated with mainstream software as well. The sign has been added to Microsoft Excel and Google’s iOS Keyboard. These additions may seem trivial, but they are a sign of growing recognition.

However, the road to a standard symbol was a long one. Until recently, Bitcoin used the Thai baht symbol (฿) as its currency sign. This didn’t cause a lot of confusion, given that Bitcoin-to-baht conversions are rare. In fact, the old symbol is still in use today on many minor websites, such as Bittybot, Predictious, and LikeForex.

Other projects that have borrowed real-world currency symbols handle the problem in creative ways. Tether uses Mongolia’s togrog sign (₮), but combines it with a currency code, as in USD₮. Cardano, meanwhile, uses Argentina’s austral sign (₳), which is not much of an issue — the original currency has been defunct for two decades.

Litecoin Uses a Faux Currency Sign

There are easier ways to avoid overlap. Plenty of characters look very similar to currency signs, even though they have never actually been used in that way. Litecoin, for example, has laid claim to Ł, a letter found in Polish and West Slavic alphabets.

Since Litecoin is less popular than Bitcoin, the Ł symbol is not quite as widely used. Most sites simply use the ticker symbol LTC to represent Litecoin amounts. However, a few sites use the Ł character on their market pages, including the market aggregator CryptoCompare.

Other coins have managed to find similar symbols. Lisk uses Ⱡ, Dogecoin uses Ð, and Reddcoin uses Ɍ. Hedera Hashgraph uses ℏ for its coin, HBAR, and some Bitcoin users employ Ƀ as an alternative to the baht symbol. None of these symbols have any currency-related uses outside of crypto, so this is a sensible and clear approach.

Ethereum Uses a Strokeless Symbol

Ethereum has used Ξ as its sign since 2014. The symbol is actually the Greek letter Xi, but it plainly resembles a stylized E, making it an obvious choice for Ethereum. It’s also notable for its “strokeless” design, which breaks from the standard set by world currencies.

Though it is not exactly mainstream, the Ξ symbol is used fairly often in the Ethereum ecosystem. The market aggregator CoinGecko, the collectibles marketplace OpenSea, and the DApp directory DAppReview are among the many websites that use Ξ to represent Ether amounts.

Other currencies use strokeless symbols as well. Monero uses ɱ, Tezos uses ꜩ, and Zcash uses ⓩ. Though these symbols are appealing and stylized, observers from outside the crypto world may not instinctively recognize them as currency signs — something that critics have previously warned of in discussions of alternative Ethereum symbols.

Stellar Has an Original Design

Some cryptocurrencies are taking their symbols in fresh directions. Stellar designed its own currency sign last year, which is reminiscent of the dollar sign and the rings of Saturn. Or, as Stellar describes it, it is “planetary, not to mention coin-like.”

Unfortunately, the symbol is not widely used outside of Stellar’s own website, marketing materials, and merchandise. Since the symbol does not yet have a corresponding Unicode character, it cannot be displayed as text. Sites that want to use the symbol must rely on an image, which is not always practical.

Despite the drawbacks, other coins have attempted original designs as well. MakerDAO introduced a new Dai symbol as part of a recent upgrade, and the XRP community has two competing symbols on the table. It may be difficult for these projects to standardize their signs, but when they do, they should have very strong brand identities.

What Does It Take to Succeed?

It’s hard to quantify what is the impact of various design styles on popularity. Cryptocurrency symbols that are shown prominently on a few major websites may not be widely used by individuals on a daily basis. On the flip side, charged debates between passionate individuals do not guarantee that exchanges and market aggregators will recognize a symbol.

However, a few factors seem to be important. Projects generally seek out symbols that are clearly currency-related, designs that resemble an existing logo, and characters that are already found within Unicode. Most of these things are true whether a symbol is chosen by a community, by developers, or designed by an outside contractor.

Though each cryptocurrency project puts a lot of thought into its decisions, practical matters should not be ignored. High-ranking and long-established coins tend to be more successful all around. Naturally, successful coins usually have more recognizable signs by default — regardless of the reasoning that led to that point.",2019-12-28 16:25:21+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/cloud-token-and-the-rise-of-mlm-crypto-projects/,"Cloud Token and the Rise of MLM Crypto Projects

Chinese law enforcement recently busted 72 individuals connected to the Cloud Token (CTO) scam. The Ponzi was similar to the Plustoken fraud and CTO scammers made off with $500 million. According to regional press, the CTO scam artists are likely connected to the Plustoken swindlers. Moreover, after the Cloud Token arrests in China, police in Inner Mongolia warned the public about another MLM crypto project.

Cloud Token and Plustoken: The Rise of the Ponzi Scheme Wallets

In 2018, the cryptocurrency community was introduced to a project called Cloud Token. Similar to the Ponzi scheme Plustoken, CTO called itself the first online wallet that could integrate all the popular crypto assets out there today. The creators claimed CTO was a ‘4.0 blockchain project’ and the wallet held USDT, TUSD, BCH, CTO, BTC, LTC, ETH, and DOGE. Just like Plustoken, CTO promised 6-12% interest every month. The project was initially founded by the project’s lead developer Ronald Aai and project manager Daniel Csokas from Singapore. Nearly every article describing the Cloud Token project shows that the scam was tightly connected to the Plustoken creators. In June a report highlighted that the Cloud Token project had issues in Singapore so the MLM crypto scheme’s founders decided to relocate.

Mauritius’ Financial Services Commission Warns the Public About Cloud Token

After leaving Singapore, the publication behindmlm.com reported that the CTO project leaders retreated to Malaysia and the Republic of Mauritius. “In addition to committing securities fraud in the US, Cloud Token is also not registered to offer securities in Singapore or Malaysia,” behindmlm.com explained in June. The following September, Mauritius’ Financial Services Commission (FSC) issued a statement to the public telling people to beware of CTO:

The public is being solicited by a certain group of people on social media under the name of ‘Cloud Token Mauritius’ and ‘Cloud Token Indian Ocean and Africa’ to invest in digital assets and cryptocurrencies through the ‘Cloud Token’ mobile application. It has also come to the attention of the FSC that events are being hosted in publicly accessible areas in Mauritius to promote this application. The FSC urges investors and the public to exercise caution in any dealings with Cloud Token Mauritius and Cloud Token Indian Ocean and Africa.

Following the FSC statement, in December news.Bitcoin.com reported on the arrest of 72 CTO associates. Police from Taiyuan, Shanxi province busted the alleged scammers at a train station and investigators disclosed the project defrauded Chinese investors out of 30 million yuan ($4 million).

After the Cloud Token Scheme Takes in $500 Million, Another MLM Cryptocurrency Project Begins

An editorial published by the China-based publication 8btc explains that during its tenure, the CTO project got away with $500 million. An anonymous CTO victim told 8btc that they deposited $20,000 into the wallet. “The crypto scam stole over $500 million from unsuspecting holders, claiming it’s a decentralized wallet that would reward its users for holding coins,” the anonymous person stressed. “Payment was to be received in the form of the company’s utility token and the reward would be 6% to 10% of the invested coin amount. [Meanwhile] the man promising all these rewards vanished with funds from over 800,000 members wondering when and how they will get their initial investment back.”

Despite the arrest, there are still a number of CTO websites that are still operational. One particular website news.Bitcoin.com visited today showed the price per CTO to be $0.50 and gave a referral code. 8btc columnist Lylian Teng explained that China’s police force is also attempting to squash another crypto Ponzi scheme called Wotoken (WOR). Behindmlm.com has informed the public that Wotoken’s website “provides no information about who owns or runs the business.” Again similarly to Plustoken and Cloud Token, the Wotoken Ponzi scheme promises a daily ROI for a deposit of crypto coins. The multi-level marketing crypto also involves shady referral commissions that allegedly distribute WOR returns.

“By now you should be familiar with the MLM cryptocurrency exit-scam model,” a behindmlm.com report details after reporting on a large number of scams like Onecoin, Cloud Token, Plustoken, and Wotoken as well. “Whenever whoever is running Wotoken decides they’ve stolen enough money or investor recruitment collapses, they’ll announce WOR’s public listing.” The MLM website’s Wotoken review concedes:

Every MLM cryptocurrency scheme has followed this trajectory — Wotoken will be no different.

Countries around the world realized cryptocurrencies are here to stay and adjusted their crypto tax policies as a result. This year alone, several countries have been busy establishing and amending crypto tax legislation. Governments around the world have published updated guidance, changed crypto tax rules, and used crypto tax benefits to attract high-net individuals, while some even banned crypto completely. Looking at the crypto tax legislation worldwide in 2019, one thing is apparent: No one can deny crypto tax anymore. Crypto is considered an asset and is therefore taxable. Whether you pay them or actively choose to avoid them, you are aware of the implications of your actions.

Let’s take a closer look at 2019 worldwide crypto tax legislation:

North America

United States: New guidance, changing tax forms, and enforcement letters:

It was a hectic year for the Internal Revenue Service.

After sending thousands of letters to cryptocurrency investors to clarify crypto tax obligations, the IRS issued two new pieces of guidance for taxpayers engaged in digital currency transactions. In addition, standard tax form 1040 Schedule 1 has been updated to include a broad declaration regarding crypto holdings or trades.

The new guidance includes Revenue Ruling 2019-24, and 43 frequently asked questions. But not all is clear in the U.S. crypto tax territory: Like-kind exchange, which basically means tax exemption on exchanging one crypto to another, was formally forbidden by the IRS back in 2018, but issues regarding 2017 reports are yet to be cleared.

The messages from IRS representatives on this issue are contradictory, and official guidance has yet to be published.

Bermuda: Tax payments with crypto

Unlike the state of Ohio, which suspended its service for paying taxes with Bitcoin, Bermuda will be the first government to accept its own stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), for tax payments, according to global financial services company, Circle.

The crypto tax payments are part of a broader initiative that has the Bermuda government supporting “the use of stablecoins and decentralized finance protocols and services.” The Bermudian dollar relies on a U.S. dollar-backed currency, and it seems like the Bermuda’s government is leading the crypto government payments industry. Circle Co-Founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said:

“Bermuda’s Premier made a broader announcement today about embracing stablecoins as the future of the financial system, with a focus on innovations in fintech that can deliver value not just for Bermudians, but also globally via companies licensed under their Digital Asset Business Act.”

Europe

Portugal: No individuals crypto tax

Portugal is one of the few countries that has managed to take advantage of the crypto taxation situation to attract high-net-worth individuals to its territory.

Last August, The Portugal Tax Authority announced that cryptocurrency trading and payments in crypto would not be subject to value-added tax. This announcement follows a ruling from 2018, which declares that proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies for individuals will be tax free. Any crypto sale or exchange does not qualify as capital gains, which normally holds a 28% tax rate in the country. In addition, cryptocurrency trading will not be considered investment income, which is also subject to a 28% tax rate under other circumstances.

However, it should be noted that this applies only to individuals, as Portugal-based businesses are still subject to several taxes, including VAT, social security and income taxes.

Will Portugal succeed in establishing itself as a crypto-powerful country? Only time will tell.

UK: The Queen’s traditional approach commences to crypto

The United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, or HMRC, has recently updated its cryptocurrency taxation policy paper for businesses and individuals.

The authority’s traditional position is reflected in this policy paper, stating that the HMRC does not consider crypto as a currency, and instead uses the term “cryptoassets.”

As in most countries, the policy paper for individuals considers crypto activity as a personal investment subject to capital gains tax. Any sale, exchange, gifts, goods or services of crypto in the U.K. are subject to tax.

Capital gains tax is commonly used to tax crypto activity in many countries, such as the U.S. and Israel. However, while other countries are struggling to draw the line between personal activity and professional trading, the HMRC states that crypto falls into the definition of business activity “only in exceptional circumstances,” continuing:

“HMRC expects individuals to buy and sell cryptoassests with such frequency, level of organization and sophistication that the activity amounts to a financial trade in itself.”

The policy paper goes on to further state that an employee’s salary and mining activity are subject to income tax.

France: No crypto to crypto tax

It seems like France’s minister of economy and finance, Bruno Le Maire, is a reasonable voice of crypto taxation.

The French government decided not to follow its Western associates, and in an unusual step, announced that crypto-to-crypto transactions are tax free in France.

As reported in September 2019, French authorities will not tax crypto-to-crypto trades but will tax cryptocurrencies when they are sold for fiat currency.

For those who understand crypto tax practice, this is the only outcome that does not carry double taxation on crypto-to-crypto trading.

In many cases, tax calculation of crypto-to-crypto transactions will lead to double taxation, especially when using calculation methods such as first in, first out, or FIFO.

Denmark: Seeking profits and losses for 2016–2018

Taking a leaf out of the guidance of the U.S. IRS, the Danish tax agency, Skattestyrelsen, has begun sending letters to crypto traders requesting them to provide a full background of all their crypto transactions.

Skattestyrelsen is specifically seeking information about profits and losses from 2016 to 2018 according to the FIFO method.

The Danish tax agency’s focus on crypto holders began late last year when the agency confirmed it was in the process of identifying 2,700 individuals that reportedly owed taxes on Bitcoin (BTC) gains.

Then, in January 2019, the country’s tax council authorized Skattestyrelsen to obtain information on all crypto trades across the three domestic crypto exchanges in the country. By August, the agency received the green light to obtain information regarding crypto trading from 20,000 private individuals.

While efforts are becoming widespread, it is still too early to tell what the future holds for Danish traders.

Oceania

Australia: In line with leading Western countries

The Australian Taxation Office published a guidance framework in June 2019 classifying cryptocurrencies as “forms of property” that are subject to capital gain tax and require reporting.

Additionally, the ATO views BTC-based transactions as being “barter arrangements” that, while not subject to goods and services tax, are still subject to capital gains tax.

This guidance follows suit with other major Western countries like the U.S. and the U.K., and seems to be the dominant position in the crypto taxation world.

New Zealand: Paying salaries with crypto

The national tax authority of New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department, has published guidance for salaries and bonuses paid in crypto in August 2019.

While publishing a crypto salary-related ruling may appear as if New Zealand is trying to establish itself as a crypto-friendly country, IRD Commissioner Naomi Ferguson is making it clear that the New Zealand government does not consider crypto to be a currency.

“In the Commissioner’s view, crypto-assets are property. Crypto-assets are not ‘money’ as commonly understood (at least not at the present time). In particular, because crypto-assets are not issued by any government, they are not legal tender anywhere. Further, although acceptance of certain crypto-assets as payment for goods and services is increasing, they are not ‘generally accepted’ as payment.

Given the extreme volatility experienced to date, there are also issues around some crypto-assets’ ability to be a store of value.”

The ruling applies only to salary and wage earners and not to self-employed individuals, and only for services performed by an employee for a fixed amount and as a regular part of their remuneration.

Asia

China: Virtual property, but not fiat money

Surprisingly, after China banned crypto trading in 2017, a Chinese court gained legal recognition by formally describing Bitcoin as virtual property in July 2019. This ruling was a part of a dispute between a now-defunct exchange and one of its users who had lost funds.

Currently, there is no specific rule for crypto taxation in China, but this court’s attention to crypto as an asset may trigger the Chinese tax authority to announce a crypto tax policy.

Singapore: No value-added tax for crypto and a welcome VAT exemption

Starting January 2020, Goods and Services Tax, or GST, which is Singapore’s equivalent to value-added tax, will not apply to crypto transactions in the city-state.

In July 2019, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore published the proposed draft e-tax guide exemption for cryptocurrencies that are intended to function as a medium of exchange from GST. Recently, in November, the draft was approved by the IRAS and became official.

Until the end of 2019, cryptocurrencies that function as a medium of exchange were treated as a barter trade. The IRAS notes that Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and other currencies meet its definition of a digital payment token designed to function as a medium of exchange. At the same time, stablecoins are excluded from this definition but will also be exempt from GST.

“A digital payment token must not have a value that is based on the value of anything else. Therefore, any digital token that is denominated in any fiat currency or with a value pegged to any fiat currency (e.g. stablecoins) will not qualify as a digital payment token.”

It could be that the IRAS is getting ready for Libra’s release, as the guide specifies the GST exemption is for stablecoins backed to a basket of currencies.

“Instead, tokens that are pegged to or backed by any fiat currency, a basket of currencies, commodities or other assets are derivatives that are currently exempt under paragraph 1(j) of Part I of the Fourth Schedule to the GST Act. Supplies of these tokens continue to be GST exempt.”

Thailand: Blockchain use for taxes

While Bermuda accepts crypto for tax payments, the Thai government refunds taxes using blockchain.

On Nov. 25, Director-General Patchara Anuntasilpa told the Bangkok Post that the Thailand Excise Department will change its current tax refund practices by introducing a blockchain-based tax payback system, which it hopes to implement by the middle of 2020.

Anuntasilpa explained that the future tax payback system will require oil exporters to pay excise tax and claim overpaid taxes after they have shipped fuel. Blockchain technology will help the department more efficiently inspect the tax payments.

Currently, oil exporters are required to submit documents for a tax waiver, but inspection is not as thorough as it could be.

Iran: Tax carrot and stick for crypto mining

In their battle against illicit crypto mining, Iranian authorities are offering a bounty to anyone who exposes unauthorized mining operations in the country. Conversely, Iranian mining companies who are authorized will enjoy tax benefits.

In September, the Iranian National Tax Administration announced that domestic mining firms are eligible for a tax exemption if they agree to repatriate their overseas earnings.

As reported, the INTA introduced a repatriation tax exemption similar to the one it offers non-oil exporters.

The INTA considers cryptocurrency mining a taxable business like any other industrial activity, and as such, believes it should follow the requirements set by the Central Bank of Iran in repatriating their overseas earnings.

Eurasia

Georgia: No value-added tax and prohibition on crypto payments

The government of Georgia is joining the list of countries that choose to exempt crypto from VAT. In June 2019, Georgia’s Finance Minister Nodar Khaduri signed a bill aimed at regulating the taxation of entities that trade or mine cryptocurrency. However, the exemption does not apply to mining companies who still need to pay VAT, unless they are registered abroad.

In Georgia, foreign currencies cannot be used as a means of payment, and for that reason, the country will not allow the use of crypto for payments.

South America

Brazil: An obligation to report every crypto transaction

The Brazilian government has every intent to closely monitor crypto traders in Brazil.

In May 2019, The Federal Revenue of Brazil instructed all Brazilian citizens involved in crypto to report on their transactions. This new measure applies to individuals, companies and brokerages regarding all kinds of crypto-related activities, including buying and selling, barters, deposits, withdrawals and others.

As reported, the RFB believes that the digital currency market in Brazil has more investors than Brazil’s second-oldest stock exchange, which reportedly has about 800,000 customers. Taking the market size into consideration, it’s no wonder that the RFB requires monthly reports of crypto activity, which is considered a heavy burden as far as tax reports go.

The rules also require local crypto exchanges to inform the RFB of all operations. There is no minimum threshold for reporting requirements. Crypto traders on foreign exchanges or anyone who trades peer-to-peer have a minimum threshold and will only have to report on transactions on amounts higher than 30,000 Brazilian reals per month.

By applying this measure, the authority intends to combat illicit activities such as money laundering, tax evasion and terrorist financing, and those who do not comply will face penalties of up to 3% of the amount of the unreported transaction.

2019 will be marked as the year of crypto tax policy changes. After 11 years of Bitcoin’s existence, countries around the world are creating clarity for taxpayers regarding the crypto activity. Now, we only need to wait and see if, after all has been said and done, 2020 will be the year that finally shows a significant increase in tax filings.

As digital currencies become a mainstay in society, a great number of governments have enforced strict tax guidelines, severe money transmission rules, and tough regulations. Because of a few nation-states’ harsh rules against cryptos, there are individuals who plan to renounce their citizenship in order to become stateless. Some people will also attempt to get double-citizenship, as both of these acts may help sovereign individuals avoid government intrusion and theft.

A Cryptocurrency Advocate’s Quest for Financial Sovereignty May Involve Hard Choices

It’s been close to 11 years since the inception of Bitcoin and during the last few years government agencies and law enforcement have been cracking down on digital currency holders. In certain areas around the world, a few countries have extremely difficult crypto laws and stringent capital gains taxes. Countries like the U.S. have imposed strict regulatory guidelines across the cryptocurrency ecosystem and when the FATF “travel” rule applies things are only going to get worse. Despite the fact that a good portion of countries enforce horrible regulations against digital currency use, there are plenty of regions that are far more friendly toward the technology. To some people, in order to combat against overreaching statism, renouncing their citizenship or obtaining a second citizenship to a friendlier area is a great way to escape the wrath of the immoral governments.

Renouncing Your U.S. Citizenship

You can renounce your citizenship in a variety of countries, but the U.S. has seen a significant amount of people relinquishing their citizenship. In fact, since 1998, the number of individuals renouncing their U.S. citizenship has been rising exponentially, year after year. The biggest reason Americans are leaving in large numbers is because of tax laws and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The FATCA rule, a law that combats offshore accounts, initiated across the U.S. in 2010 and ever since then, Americans dropping their citizenship grew significantly. Additionally, the U.S. has shown contempt for digital currency holders forcing them to reconsider citizenship in order to find a region with fewer restrictions.

Renouncing your U.S. citizenship is doable, but the process can be lengthy and costly. American residents must pay 20X the average cost other nation-states charge, which can also vary between $1,000 to $5,000 per individual. The person must settle any unpaid taxes too and any government-based debts. Then after all the money is considered, Americans must relinquish their citizenship by showing intent to an authority figure. You must sign an oath declaring voluntary renunciation and then appear before a U.S. consular.

In addition to the consular or diplomatic officer, you also have to state your intentions to the U.S. embassy. Each and every one of these tasks requires patience and waiting for approval from the authorities. “During the interviews, you will have to elaborate on why you want to renounce your U.S. citizenship,” explains the nomadcapitalist.com’s ultimate guide to renouncing citizenship. The nomadcapitalist.com writer Andrew Henderson explains that the last renunciation he witnessed took about five months to process. However, Henderson notes that despite the length of time it takes, the process is rarely denied.

“The certificate is almost guaranteed,” Henderson writes. “While you do have to factor in the possibility that something wasn’t done correctly on the technical side of your renunciation, it is very rare for renunciation to be rejected once the oath is taken and the forms are submitted.”

Individuals who hold cryptocurrencies and don’t want their hard-earned funds stolen from them may consider dropping their citizenship. A number of people who also believe in individualism and have libertarian beliefs think that the manipulative U.S. state and many other strict nations are becoming far too tyrannical. There are various guides and online walkthroughs that can help people complete the process of renouncing their citizenship. Nomadcapitalist.com offers a wide variety of helpful articles (posted below) to get people started down the path toward renunciation.

Obtaining Dual Citizenship

Another act a person might consider is dual citizenship which can also help someone avoid an overstepping government. Before 1967, Americans were not allowed to hold dual citizenship but the law has since changed. Currently, U.S. residents can obtain two citizenships in 42 different countries including Australia, Barbados, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Sweden, and Iceland. One of the top regions in the world for Americans looking for dual citizenship is the islands of Nevis and St. Kitts. In 2018, the top six dual citizenship countries included Ireland, Israel, Hungary, Italy, Peru, and Macedonia. Nomadcapitalist.com columnist Henderson’s recent report explains in great depth the fastest countries in the world to become a citizen. The cost of dual citizenship can be expensive as some regions require you to purchase a home or donate funds to the country’s government.

Billfold writer Amanda McLoughlin also wrote a comprehensive report on the cost associated with dual citizenship. In order to get her dual citizenship between Ireland and the U.S., one year later after waiting for the process to complete and paying $784 McLoughlin became an Irish citizen. However, other studies show the process can take much longer and be extremely expensive for someone to gain another citizenship.

Cryptocurrency holders may choose dual citizenship in order to enjoy the benefits of quickly traveling and living in two countries. They might be able to avoid some strict laws and maybe figure out how to curb harsh taxation if they live in one area longer than the other. Although, dual citizenship might not be as beneficial as renouncing and there’s a potential for double taxation. Check out the variety of articles hosted on nomadcapitalist.com that explain the process of dual citizenship in great detail.

On September 16-19, 2020, at the Nomad Capitalist conference in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver will speak about the benefits of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) but also “how to relinquish your U.S. citizenship.” The four-day event may be of interest to crypto holders tired of governments stealing their wealth as the conference will teach participants the benefits of offshore tax strategies, overseas banking, second passports, and a sovereign lifestyle. After all, cryptocurrencies and financial sovereignty go hand in hand.

Regional authorities in the province of Sichuan are reportedly pressuring bitcoin miners to scale down operations amid electricity shortages during the dry season in Southwest China. A meeting has been scheduled with regulators, the state run grid operator and mining companies. Two hydropower stations have been fined already for powering bitcoin farms without authorization.

Winter Reduces Electricity Supply in Sichuan

Sichuan is arguably the most important Chinese region in terms of cryptocurrency mining. While China is believed to control two thirds of the bitcoin’s global hashrate, it’s been reported that Sichuan alone accounts for over 50%. The province’s abundant hydropower energy during the wet season, between May and September, along with the cool climate in its mountainous areas have made it an ideal destination for miners.

During the dry season, however, which extends from October through April, electricity generation drops significantly leading to shortfalls in supply. Prioritizing “social electricity demand” is the stated purpose for the recent government focus on mining operations. Under normal circumstances bitcoin farms coexist in symbiosis with hydropower stations, utilizing the excess energy they are capable of producing thanks to East Asia’s plum rain.

Despite China’s decision to remove bitcoin mining from an unwanted industries list, miners in the country have enough reasons to be worried. Beijing embraced blockchain development in October but soon after that made it clear it didn’t mean decentralized cryptocurrencies. A crackdown on crypto companies has scared a lot of people involved in the industry. Chinese police recently seized thousands of mining rigs in the city of Tangshan, Hebei province.

The local government in Sichuan’s Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has recently demanded a cleanup in the region’s mining sector, the Chinese outlet 8btc reported this week. Authorities have called a meeting to discuss the issue with about a dozen regulatory agencies, the tax administration, and the local branch of the state grid operator. Representatives of 10 companies involved in bitcoin mining have been summoned as well, the publication detailed.

The meeting was originally scheduled for Dec. 25 and later postponed for the 27th. No details are currently available about its outcome but a source from the Chinese mining industry confirmed the news of the government offensive in Sichuan while also noting that the move is only of a regional significance and not on a national level. “It’s not going to make a huge impact to mining in China,” the representative of a company operating mining facilities in the hydro energy-rich province told news.Bitcoin.com.

Hydropower Plants Fined for Powering Bitcoin Farms

The initiative to curtail mining operations in Sichuan has been described as a part of the local government’s efforts to ensure sufficient power supplies to satisfy the needs of residents and cover the “normal” electricity consumption in the dry season. Estimates quoted by 8btc suggest that the monthly “social electricity demand” during the winter months this year has been projected to increase 30% over last year’s.

Authorities in Garze have complained about noise and heat pollution from the mining facilities in the prefecture and even claimed that these create risks for the public and the environment. They are also unhappy with the influx of a large number of maintenance staff, illegal constructions and excessive electric infrastructure. Mining companies have been accused of not paying local taxes and fees.

Officially, bitcoin miners are not welcome in this and other Chinese regions. In reality, they’ve been allowed to operate in Sichuan during the wet season when hydropower plants need more consumers. Many of them relocate to provinces rich in thermal power during the dry winter months. This time, however, authorities have been going after power plants as well. Two stations have been fined the equivalent of 140,000 dollars earlier in December for providing electricity to bitcoin farms without obtaining a power supply license.

Soon after Google-owned Youtube has swung the strikes hammer against video content creators that talked about cryptocurrency-related topics, another arm of the search monopoly has taken down a popular ethereum dapps client.

Metamask Kicked out of Google Play Store

Google Play, the official app store for the Android operating system which is used by billions of mobile devices around the world and operated by Google, has banned the crypto app Metamask. The company pointed its restricted content policy on apps that expose users to deceptive or harmful financial products and services as a reason for the ban. The policy details that “we don’t allow apps that mine cryptocurrency on devices,” despite the fact that mining is something Metamask is not designed to do.

“If left banned, we will be working on other ways of bringing our services to users still stranded on the Android platform while they migrate to something more free,” the Metamask team stated on Twitter. “The story will not stop here, and it certainly won’t stop with the Goliath winning.”

In the last week, the MetaMask Android client was suspended by the Google Play App Store @googleplaydev. They cited their policy that bans mining on mobile, which we don’t. Appeal rejected. #ProtectWeb3.https://t.co/rfP4EbOAqv!?zippy_activeEl=cryptocurrencies%23cryptocurrencies — MetaMask (@metamask_io) December 26, 2019

Metamask is a decentralized apps browser for desktop and mobile built upon the Ethereum network. It also offers browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave that add an in-browser wallet for ETH and ERC20 tokens to be sent and received. If you are using Android using an extension with one the supported browsers is a way to access the Metamask service until another solution in found.

Crypto Community Turns Against Data Monopoly

The move to ban Metamask from the Play Store comes at an especially tense time between Google and the crypto community. This is because only recently the google-owned video sharing website Youtube has removed content and banned channels that promote or otherwise analyze the digital asset markets. The company has since claimed this was done by mistake and reinstated some channels but the risk it poses to the ability to spread news ideas have already become clear.

The Youtube affair drove many in the crypto community to look for ways to back up their content or even migrate to alternative platforms, with some influencers suggesting there is a need to develop new decentralized and censorship-resistant platforms for video sharing. If more crypto apps will be blocked perhaps there will be a similar move to diversify away from Android with a new crypto friendly and open operating system for mobile devices. Depending on a tech giant like Google that monopolizes search, email, video sharing and other fields could be a major problem for any technology that aims to change the world.

During the last few days, digital currency markets have been meandering sideways and prices have been less volatile. On Sunday, during the last 24 hours, the entire cryptoconomy is hovering just below the $200 billion zone and there’s roughly $71 billion in global trades. Crypto proponents are still uncertain about the future trajectory and whether or not digital currency price trends will continue sliding or rise again.

The Cryptoconomy Continues to Meander Sideways

Digital currency markets on Dec. 29, have seen a bunch of cryptos gather a few gains during the 24 hours of trading. Currently, the top 10 crypto market capitalizations have seen percentage increases between 0.50% to 5%. At the moment, BTC prices are around $7,392 which is up 1.05% for the day. BTC has an overall market valuation of around $134 billion and roughly $21 billion in 24-hour trade volume. Out of all the coin caps, BTC’s $134 billion market cap is dominating by 68%, but 74% of all BTC trades this Sunday is in tether (USDT).

Ethereum (ETH) is swapping for $130 per coin and ETH markets are up 2.3% during today’s trading sessions. This is followed by ripple (XRP) markets which have seen a 1.2% gain today and each XRP is trading for $0.19. The fourth-largest market valuation belongs to the stablecoin tether (USDT) and USDT is capturing around two-thirds of every crypto trade on Sunday. On Dec. 29, USDT trade volume is the highest out of all the coins with $25 billion worth of global swaps.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH/USD) Market Action

Bitcoin cash (BCH) markets are up 2.6% today and 13.4% during the last seven days of trading. Each BCH is swapping for $212 per coin and BCH has a market valuation of around $3.87 billion. At the time of publication, there is $1.7 billion worth of bitcoin cash being traded on exchanges and USDT captures 53% of all BCH trades. This is followed by BTC (23.29%), USD (13.06%), USDK (4.14%), ETH (3.52%), and KRW (1.32%). Looking at the weekly and daily BCH charts, Fxstreet analyst Ken Chigbo explained on Dec. 27 that BCH/USD is set to test the big $200 barrier.

“Weekly price action smashed through the $200 mark, a retest is being observed in the current week, however, so far only resulting in rejection,” Chigbo said. “Price action is resting a breached daily pennant structure, a break and closure above would be critical for the bulls,” the analyst added.

Gold Bug Peter Schiff Doesn’t See Bitcoin Gains

On Dec. 27, the notorious gold bug Peter Schiff said that BTC is the only asset in the world right now that’s not rallying toward the end of the year. “Bitcoin is not disappointing those who claim its true value is that it’s a non-correlated asset,” Schiff tweeted. “Every asset class in the world is rallying into the end of the year except Bitcoin. Not sure what value this actually adds, but at least Bitcoin is meeting expectations on something,” the economist further remarked. Despite Schiff’s opinion, the digital asset climbed more than 8.9 million percent over the last 10 years compared to gold’s 38% climb. Moreover, the cryptocurrency was still the best performing asset in 2019 as well, even though prices have dropped.

Do Bearish Prices Equal an Upcoming Rip Your Face Off Rally?

Even though prices have been lagging, bitcoiners and crypto proponents believe markets will spike in the near future. Bitcoin trader Michaël van de Poppe thinks a deeper bottom is coming and a much larger rally will follow after. “Very simple, 2020 is going to be a great year for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin,” the trader tweeted. “If market capitalization remains above $145-150 billion, I won’t be surprised we’ll see a rally towards $500-600 billion.”

In addition to this prediction, the prominent BTC commentator Hodlonaut can envision a face-melting rally. “The kind of sentiment doldrums we are in now [and] people seemingly accepting that 7k is fair value,” Hodlonaut wrote. “Dozens of bull narratives proven wrong — Fatigue high, hype low. [It] is exactly the type of place where it would be trademark Bitcoin character to start a rip your face off rally,” he added.

Overall, most traders and crypto enthusiasts are still uncertain as to where the future will take cryptocurrencies in the short term. Long term optimism is still high, but a decent number of analysts and traders think the bearish sentiment is not over. BTC/USD long positions (people betting the price will rise) have dipped a touch but are still extremely high compared to normal. Meanwhile, BTC/USD short positions (people betting against the price) are very low and there doesn’t seem to be many traders willing to short right now.

In an ongoing Twitter debate, David Schwartz, Ripple’s chief technology officer, rebuffed a claim that XRP was designed as a revenue stream for the company.

Schwartz: XRP does not make Ripple richer

The argument followed further tweets from sources including ex-Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd, who alleged Ripple’s partners had told him they were not prepared to use XRP. Schwartz protested:

“Nobody buys XRP to give Ripple money to do things.”

XRP investors have felt the pinch in recent weeks as the token fell to more than two-year lows against the U.S. dollar. Currently trading at around $0.19, XRP/USD is now down almost 95% against its all-time high of $3.40.

For bagholders, the picture is complicated by the curious relationship Ripple maintains with XRP. Past spats have seen Schwartz and others attempt to divorce the company from suggestions it created and controls XRP, despite it selling huge tranches of tokens throughout the past two years.

Over time, as Cointelegraph reported, those sell-offs have only increased in size.

Familiar controversies

Now, however, Schwartz appeared to distance Ripple — and its sell-offs — from XRP even further, stating:

“We were vc/angel funded and were going to build regardless. We started selling XRP only after there was a market price and for negligible amounts compared to our other funding.”

The schism appeared to intensify after prominent Bitcoin trader Tone Vays openly suggested that XRP was an illegally-launched security.

Days before, on Dec. 20, Ripple announced it had secured a $200 million Series C funding round. This led it to describe 2019 as its “strongest year” in official literature, despite XRP’s conversely dire fortunes.",,https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-ripple-xrp-most-bought-on-coinbase/,"According to a new report Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are among the most purchased coins on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

In addition, the holding period for almost all cryptocurrencies is still increasing.

Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States of America and has more than 20 million active customers. The most bought coin is still Bitcoin, closely followed by other prominent Altcoins. A new report from the ICO news website cryptodiffer.com shows that the holding period has increased further compared to the last survey.

BTC, ETH and XRP on the top ranks

Coinbase provides various trading signals on its own platform, allowing users to prepare their decisions and analyse further metrics. These include the typical hold time of a cryptocurrency, the popularity of the cryptocurrency on Coinbase and the trading activity.

Cryptodiffer.com has analyzed these three metrics and found that the average hold time has continued to increase over the last 4 weeks. Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP are among the most purchased cryptocurrencies on Coinbase. These statistics show that although the market capitalization has dropped from 210 billion USD to nearly 197 billion USD since the end of November until today, users of the platform hold cryptocurrencies longer.

Bitcoin is held on average 89 days before BTC is moved to another wallet or traded. Ethereum has a holding period of 105 days and Litecoin of 125 days. ZRX has the longest holding period with 142 days, followed by ETC with a holding period of 130 days.

It is also striking that the holding period of Tezos has increased by 40% compared to the last survey. This is probably due to the Tezos-Staking implemented by Coinbase. Tezos holders receive a guaranteed annual staking profit of 5% each year for holding Tezos. The profits are distributed in proportion to the amount of assets held on the exchange.

Coinbase has also overtaken Polychain Labs as the largest validator in the Tezos network. However, this development comes as no surprise, as Coinbase had to buy more Tezos to be able to offer the staking service on a sufficient scale. Exchanges like Coinbase can only guarantee their users a profit if they keep XTZ in sufficient volume.

The Twitter user The Don pointed out already in early December that Coinbase has to buy more than one million XTZ in order not to lose staking rights and to be able to pay the users.

Adaptation of cryptocurrencies in the USA is increasing

Coinbase had published a report in early November showing that more than 27 million people in the United States own Bitcoin, representing 9% of the total population. Furthermore, the analysis service Google Trends shows that the interest in Bitcoin is growing more strongly, even displacing search queries such as “royal wedding” or “election results”.

A return analysis by Coinbase also shows that Bitcoin has achieved a higher return over the last 10 years than the world’s most important stock index, the S&P500. Bitcoin has achieved a return of 132%. In comparison: Nasdaq 100 +17%, the S&P 500 +12%, the FTSE Europe 100 +11% and the FTSE ASEAN 40 -3%.

Although these statistics show that Bitcoin has been able to achieve a positive development in various areas, Bitcoin shows a high volatility and a high investment risk. The price of Bitcoin has been trending sideways (+0.67%) over the last 24 hours and at the time of writing stands at USD 7,369.

Bitcoin.com Exchange Offers New Fiat Gateway

Bitcoin.com Exchange has announced that it has added the option to buy cryptocurrencies with credit and debit cards to the platform. This milestone has been achieved in partnership with Moonpay, a fiat-crypto payment provider that has already equipped the Bitcoin.com Wallet with the functionality of buying BCH using a credit card.

“We are very excited to partner with Moonpay to offer our users a simple way to purchase cryptocurrencies with fiat money. Bitcoin.com Exchange is dedicated to making it easier for newbies in the industry to get started, so making crypto available via fiat was a logical next step towards achieving our mission,” commented Danish Chaudhry, COO of the Bitcoin.com Exchange.

Bitcoin.com Exchange was launched by Bitcoin.com following a re-branding to represent the vision of an inclusive crypto ecosystem where anyone can gain economic freedom. The exchange, as an addition to the existing financial services, offers new as well as advanced traders a secure space to trade their cryptocurrencies since September this year.

The platform employs institutional-grade encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA) and IP whitelisting to keep user accounts secure at all times. With the addition of the Moonpay gateway to Bitcoin.com Exchange, users will be able to buy all major currencies listed on the exchange with a credit or debit card. Available digital assets include ADA, ATOM, BCH, BTC, EOS, ETC, ETH, LTC, ONT, TRX, USDT, WAVES, XLM, and XRP.

By partnering with Moonpay, Bitcoin.com Exchange is advancing in its mission of making cryptocurrencies more accessible. This was also highlighted by Moonpay co-founder and CTO Victor Faramond who commented: “At Moonpay we believe a user-friendly onboarding experience is essential to make cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone. We’re thrilled to partner with Bitcoin.com Exchange to help users top-up their accounts instantly.”

Going forward, Bitcoin.com Exchange and Moonpay will collaborate to continuously improve the fiat-crypto onboarding experience for users. In the near future, Moonpay and Bitcoin.com Exchange are also planning to add Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) tokens to the fiat gateway.

SLP was created in 2018 as the first token ecosystem living on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain. Since inception of the protocol, more than 6,000 SLP tokens have been created and the number is growing. As a Bitcoin Cash focused exchange, Bitcoin.com Exchange has recently added several SLP tokens to the platform including FLEX, GOC and ACD. More SLP tokens are scheduled to be listed.

National Training Institute’s Blockchain Program

The Indian government’s National Power Training Institute (NPTI) has organized a program entitled “Blockchain Technology” to take place at various NPTI locations. Three of them have already been scheduled. One will be on Jan. 6 -10 in Nangal, followed by one on Feb. 17 – 21 in New Delhi, and then on March 16 – 20 in Shivpuri, Madhya Pradesh.

“The widespread popularity of digital cryptocurrencies has led the foundation of blockchain, which is fundamentally a public ledger to share information in trustworthy and secure way,” the program’s overview reads. “Blockchain technology is an emerging technology suitable for decentralized and transactional sharing of data across a large network of untrusted participants. By using this technology one can maintain continuously-growing list of records called blocks and link them in a distributed manner (blockchain), potentially in such a way that these are secured against tampering.” The description continues:

Considering the growing importance of blockchain technology and its potential in different sectors, this five-day training program is planned and sessions would be delivered by experts from the Industry.

The five-day program consists of 14 sessions, a lab, hands-on experiments, and open discussion. Among the topics attendees will learn are blockchain, its use cases, smart contracts, ledgers, the Ethereum framework, the concepts and applications of cryptocurrency, the integration of crypto and blockchain, Bitcoin, and mining.

Registration is free and each course can have up to 50 participants. The program is organized by NPTI and sponsored by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) Training and Learning (ATAL) Academy. The target audience for the blockchain program is postgraduate students, faculty members, and Ph.D. researchers of AICTE-affiliated educational institutions. Prior to the three scheduled courses, the NPTI organized two-day workshops and a five-day blockchain technology program in September at its headquarters in Faridabad, its website details.

The NPTI is a national apex body for training and human resources development under the Indian government’s Ministry of Power. It currently has nine locations throughout the country — in Faridabad, New Delhi, Nangal, Neyveli, Durgapur, Guwahati, Nagpur, and two in Bengaluru. Two more locations are being established in Alappuzha and Shivpuriand, which will soon be operational.

The Power Ministry was where Subhash Chandra Garg was assigned to after he left the Department of Economic Affairs. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi reshuffled his cabinet soon after Garg’s interministerial committee submitted a draft bill to categorically ban cryptocurrencies, except state-issued ones. Garg has since resigned from the Power Ministry.

Growing Number of Blockchain Courses

According to the list of programs on the AICTE website, there are many other crypto and blockchain-related courses organized by various educational establishments throughout India. The National Institute of Technology (NIT) Puducherry, for example, is hosting a five-day national workshop from Dec. 27 to 31 on “Blockchain Application Development Using Hyperledger and Ethereum.” Among the topics covered in this workshop are cryptocurrencies and exchanges.

Other educational establishments offering blockchain programs include JNT University, Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, and Bangalore University.

A number of institutes in the state of Kerala also offer blockchain-related programs including the Government College of Engineering, Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology, and Cochin University of Science and Technology. The state also has a blockchain academy, an initiative of the Kerala government under the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management. Kerala Blockchain Academy (KBA) is an official training partner of the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Project and an R3 consortium partner. Recently, Kerala’s Information Technology Secretary Shri. M Sivasankar said that the state plans to produce 20,000 blockchain experts in the next two years.

The Indian government-backed learning platform Swayam also offers courses on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, one of which is scheduled to start in February.

An investigation launched on the request of a French startup has led to the indictment of a 37-year-old entrepreneur accused of stealing 182 BTC from the company he cofounded. Embezzlement of money is one the charges brought against him by the public prosecutor’s office in Paris.

Another Case Affirms the Money Status of Cryptocurrencies

Most European governments are yet to legalize and regulate cryptocurrencies. The process is starting to take shape and form with the implementation of the FATF standards and the transposition of EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) into national legislations. Laws that go beyond pure AML rules are also likely to be adopted and some crypto-friendly jurisdictions have already done that.

In the meantime, real life events are forcing authorities to deal with the phenomenon and acknowledge some of its basic characteristics. ‘Moneyness’ is one of the features of decentralized digital currencies that institutions are generally unwilling to recognize. But when coins are subject to a crime, that suddenly changes for some reason, as a recent ruling by Russia’s Supreme Court showed.

In a similar context, a case in France now provides another confirmation that cryptocurrencies can be viewed as money even without specific regulations stating so. A businessman involved in the case has been accused of funds embezzlement and money laundering along with unauthorized entry into an automated data processing system and criminal manipulation of the data.

Entrepreneur Snatches 182 Bitcoins From His Former Company

The investigation was launched on a request from the digital technologies startup, which he helped launch in 2013. It was a pretty successful endeavor for the electronics specialist until a conflict broke out over differences regarding the development strategy. He was eventually fired from his position at the company and decided to leave the country in search for better opportunities.

The man’s former partners allege that acting from abroad he managed to steal 182 BTC, or around €1.2 million at the time of writing. According to the Le Parisien newspaper, which covered the story, that’s the third-largest crypto theft in the history of France so far. The misappropriation of funds took place between December 2018 and January this year, Russian media reported.

According to the publication, the tech expert knew the company’s electronic system very well and was able to penetrate it without being detected. He also withdrew the money in multiple transactions making sure each one was smaller than the limit that would automatically trigger a security alert. It took the cybercrime unit of the Paris prosecutor’s office several months to identify the wallet the cryptocurrency was transferred to and link it to the suspect.

The man was detained on Dec. 22 in the French department of Calvados upon his return to the country. Despite the prosecutors’ request for a permanent arrest, the accused has been released by court authorities and placed only under “strict judicial supervision.”

Of interest to Cointelegraph’s readers, her positivity toward the future of cryptocurrencies has earned her the moniker “Crypto Mom.”

Backdropped by recent efforts to update exemptions from security offering registration, as well as an ongoing tug-of-war with legislators as to how to handle crypto, Commissioner Peirce sat down with Cointelegraph to discuss recent changes in regulatory approach and what to look for in the next.

New exemptions

On Dec. 18, the SEC announced a series of proposed changes to their classification of “accredited investor,” a designation based on certain income and/or knowledge requirements. The basic concept of an accredited investor is a person who can fend for themselves when it comes to the risk associated with early-stage investment — which can involve sifting through murkier business practices but also higher potential rewards.

Accredited investors are allowed to participate in securities offerings exempt from SEC registration requirements under Regulation D. Any change to accredited investor status potentially opens the field of early, private investment to a new segment of people.

In the case of crypto, this is particularly meaningful given the ongoing controversy surrounding whether to treat initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities offerings or not. In famous cases like block.one’s EOS or ongoing proceedings against Telegram’s stalled $1.7 billion sale of TON tokens, the SEC has pursued offerings that the parent firms argued were exempt from registration requirements. The proposed changes to these requirements are critical to future ICO offerings.

While Commissioner Peirce said that she looks forward to comments on the proposed changes — which include, among other things, accreditation on the basis of demonstrated knowledge — she also expressed broader ambitions: “We’re not really asking the fundamental question, which is, is this even a good framework to have?”

Broader ambitions for harmonization

Peirce’s attitude reflects the general libertarian bent of her comments on the government’s role in protecting investors, including a preference for “regulatory humility” on display at a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee in September. Speaking with Cointelegraph, she went on to explain the SEC’s current search for comment as a small part of a larger project:

“The accredited investor is just one piece that we pulled out of it. That doesn’t mean that we’re not going to do anything with the rest of it. There’s interest — at least from me — in trying to see if we can do something to try to harmonize the exemptions. That’s a big project.”

Regarding her broader hopes for the direction of securities law and investment, the commissioner wanted to see more acceptance of the risks inherent in investing, saying “with liberty comes responsibility.” Peirce’s logic was that accreditation is a status suggesting that an investor can accept risk, which she is open to expanding as long as it is not treated like a guarantee:

“If you come in and you say ‘well Hester, I’d like to invest in a broader range of things, I’d like to have access to private offerings,’ I would say to you, I agree with that objective, that you should have the liberty to make decisions about where you put your money, but you should do so understanding that there is a risk any time you invest — in the private markets and the public markets — so you could lose your money.”

As Cointelegraph reported, the SEC hosted meetings on the subject of harmonizing existing exemptions, which currently operate in an extremely complicated and opaque manner as Peirce noted, “those are things that have built up over a long period of time.”

Regarding crypto specifically, Peirce was open-minded about needing a reclassification. “A lot of this space is really about people who are purchasers of tokens and may not be investors at all,” she said. “Folks who want to invest in a project may well not qualify as accredited investors under the existing exemptions or the current proposal.”

Meaning for crypto

The prospect of a specific ICO exemption to securities law is a pipe-dream. However, Peirce was interested in reconfiguring existing regulations to embrace emerging financial technologies, including crypto. A distinction she drew that resembles the Token Taxonomy Act currently circulating in Congress is between coins that represent an investment in a company and therefore are securities and those tokens that serve more for utility purposes:

“The biggest thing the crypto community needs is a way to get from a securities offering to a utility token offering that is not covered by securities laws, or is not covered by the full panoply of the securities laws. You can’t get a token network up and running if you’re shackled by the securities laws.”

Peirce was, however, optimistic about the industry’s ability to come up with creative solutions. “One of the things I really like about this whole space, the crypto space is that it’s people coming together in a new form of civil society,” she said, elaborating:

“They’re working together and they’re taking responsibility for their actions. So don’t then look to the government to try to be your savior or your rescuer, because then you don’t really look that different.”

Looking to Congress for direction and choreography

Despite her optimism about crypto’s future, at several points the commissioner re-iterated that the SEC alone cannot provide crypto with all of the answers. This is an ongoing standoff that Cointelegraph wrote on back in September.

On the subject of the Token Taxonomy Act, Peirce sidestepped direct comment, saying “I’m familiar with it but that’s above my pay grade because that’s legislation, so I’m very happy that there are people in Congress who are interested in this area.”

The commissioner continued to explain that “Congress has the ability to provide clarity — I think we have the ability to provide some more clarity than we have, but Congress certainly has that ability.”

Peirce pointed to Congress’ ability to supersede SEC frameworks as they did with the JOBS Act of 2012, which among other things included crowdfunding provisions that greatly expanded previously neglected Regulation A exemptions. The suggestion was not only that there was a limit to what the SEC can do, given its charter, but also that they too need to be able to operate with faith in their legislative backing.

A broader congressional issue that was central to Peirce’s thoughts about the future was the need for better choreography between regulatory bodies, many of which were formed to solve the problems of the Great Depression. “A lot of the issues among agencies have really deep historical roots,” said Peirce. “As you see positive things and clarity coming out of individual agencies, there’s going to be a real need for coordination among agencies.”

Peirce’s conclusion? “At the end of the day, it’s probably going to be a necessity to have some congressional encouragement.” What form that would take, she did not specify, but she did emphasize that agencies had been working together better in recent years despite their historical friction.

News for future prosecutions?

One subject that Commissioner Peirce was remarkably evasive on was the SEC’s prosecutions and settlements within the crypto industry. In response to a question about the motivations for pursuing Telegram or other issuers of new tokens, Peirce adamantly denied that the dollar amount of these ICOs was the main motivation for the SEC to take action against them. She said, “people shouldn’t read too much into those kinds of questions, because you don’t know what the whole landscape is of what we’re doing,” continuing:

“One thing that drives me crazy in this space is that people who are watching our enforcement program are drawing all kinds of conclusions, many of which I would question [...] My advice to people is always, you need to focus on what your project is and what you’re doing and whether it is consistent with the law.”

Certainly not the most helpful of advice for people who have already made such offers, especially given how slow the SEC has been to respond to organizations looking for no-action letters on their proposed offerings.

...and Telegram?

In a case like Telegram’s, the firm alleges that the SEC was irresponsibly slow to respond to a filing for a Regulation D exception. Peirce acknowledged that she had heard complaints about the SEC’s response time, saying “that certainly is a concern that we do hear a lot. That’s fair.” And though she declined to comment on the ongoing case of Telegram, she indicated that she was more interested in pursuing genuine bad actors in the crypto world rather than ICOs issued in good faith:

“Obviously, all of us know that in this space there’s been a lot of terrible stuff that’s happened, there have been a lot of people who have put up their little shingle that said ‘I’m doing an ICO, I would like you to send me money’ and then run off with the money.”

However, it is unlikely that those looking to issue ICOs will rest any easier, given the opacity of the SEC’s current standards.

When asked about the prospect of using changes to current exemptions as a basis for overriding existing court cases, the commissioner said “no, typically, changes apply only prospectively.” That’s especially bad news for Telegram, whose legal battle with the SEC will likely extend past the period of public comment on new investor exemptions.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bithumb-crypto-exchange-reportedly-considers-litigating-689m-tax-bill,"Major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb is reportedly looking to undertake administrative litigation over an $68.9 million (80 billion won) tax bill.

English-language local news outlet KoreaHerald reported on Dec. 29 that the local tax agency has handed down over 80 billion won in taxation on the exchange.

A first occurrence of its kind in South Korea

The outlet notes that according to documents published by Bithumb’s largest shareholder Vidente via the financial supervisory services, the National Tax Service forced the exchange to pay the withholding taxes on trading activities of foreign customers. Vidente reportedly found out about the tax earlier this week, after acquiring a 34.24% stake in the parent company of the cryptocurrency exchange.

KoreaHerald explains that a foreign corporation that has no permanent establishment in South Korea has to pay withholding tax. Still, such taxation rules have not yet been applied to the cryptocurrency trading industry. While abiding the ruling, Bithumb plans to put up a fight to avoid paying the bill and considers an administrative litigation.

Cointelegraph has reached out to Bithumb for comment but the exchange has not responded at the time of writing.

2019 for Bithumb

This has been a difficult year for Bithumb. In June, the exchange was prosecuted for its alleged failure to take adequate measures to protect personal information, which was later presumably exploited by hackers to steal funds from the platform. In March, Bithumb has seen over million EOS (about $12.5 million at the time) siphoned from its hot wallet in a hack.

As Cointelegraph explained in a dedicated in-depth piece, this year has seen significant developments when it comes to cryptocurrency taxation. It seems that countries around the world realized cryptocurrencies are here to stay and adjusted their crypto tax policies as a result in order not to miss out on the revenues.",

The National Tax Service of South Korea (NTS) has decided to withhold income tax from Bithumb’s foreign customers. The total tax to be imposed on their transactions amounts to more than 80 billion won (over $69 million), the leading Korean cryptocurrency exchange announced.

Also read: Poles Hit With Backdated Tax on Crypto Trades

Bithumb to Challenge the Move Which Lacks Legal Grounds

In what has been described by Korean media as the first such attempt by the government in Seoul, the NTS is preparing to withhold the tax even before the country’s legislation has been amended to allow for the taxation of cryptocurrencies. The new provisions are expected to be adopted next year. Quoted by the Korea Joongang Daily, a notice published Friday through the Financial Supervisory Service’s system by Bithumb’s largest shareholder, Vident, detailed:

We confirmed that the NTS will impose 80.3 billion won of withholding tax on our foreign clients.

No specific taxation standards for crypto assets are in place at the moment, the outlet noted in its report. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance announced earlier this month that the 2020 tax law reform will introduce taxation for incomes and profits from cryptocurrency transactions. Industry sources say the Bithumb case is just the first step which reveals that the government will make good on its intentions.

Bithumb’s foreign clients have become the first to be targeted. But it’s actually the exchange that’s supposed to withhold and deposit the tax to the treasury. However, Bithumb is planning to take legal action against the tax claim, Vident clarified in its announcement. That means the payment may eventually be different from the stated amount.

Speaking to the newspaper, Professor Kim Woo-cheol from the University of Seoul remarked that when there’s income, there’s tax as well. He added, however, that the current situation can be described as a “tax bomb” for the digital asset trading platform. “Bithumb can pay 80.3 billion won and afterward collect the amount from its foreign clients, but practically that’s impossible,” the academic elaborated.

Crypto Profits Categorized as Miscellaneous Income

According to other tax experts quoted by the publication, the NTS has based its figure on the amounts withdrawn by foreign users from Bithumb accounts. Their earnings from trading on the exchange have been categorized as ‘miscellaneous income,’ which is subject to a tax rate of 22%. In this case, withdrawals from the platform have been estimated by the government at over 401 billion won, or around $347 million.

Miscellaneous income is one of the possible interpretations of revenues generated in cryptocurrency trading, with the other one being capital gains such as those from the sale of real estate or stock. The chosen category refers to irregular income and tax is collected once a year, while the capital gains tax should be reported paid for each deal. Such a scenario would’ve meant that Korean exchanges would have been required to report every trading record which is impractical and complicates oversight.

Besides this questionable approach, other issues stand in the way of taxation too. Before December 2017, foreigners were free to trade on Korean exchanges but many transactions were conducted under fake names or by anonymous traders, including local residents. Establishing who’s behind a certain trade and the size of their profits would be extremely difficult for trading platforms, if at all possible.

A legal challenge against the tax agency’s decision is very likely to succeed also because the move is not based on any law. Under the current Korean legislation, the state cannot impose taxes on incomes that are no specifically defined in the country’s tax code. Besides, a question that still hangs in the air is whether Seoul views decentralized cryptos as currencies or some kind of assets.

The long-lasting bear market of 2018 moved market analysts to call it the year of regulatory reckoning, leaving many jurisdictions uncertain about how to treat cryptocurrencies.

However, 2019 also turned out to be the year of the comeback, as big tech giants like Facebook moved from banning crypto to embracing it.

Escalating global events such as the trade war between the United States and China have shifted investors’ point of view on the utility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but there is still a lot to be done even as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission continues to turn down every other Bitcoin ETF proposal.

As the year comes to a close, here is a look at the companies, individuals and various crypto projects that managed to come out on top in 2019, as well as those that failed to mark the year as a positive in their books.

The winners

Bitcoin’s double growth

This year, Bitcoin and the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry celebrated its tenth anniversary as proof of the resilience of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation. However, at the beginning of 2019, the cryptocurrency industry was just recovering from the so-called crypto winter of 2018.

Fortunately, Bitcoin kicked off the year with a bullish trend that resulted in an approximate price increase of 11% higher by the end of the first quarter. Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital asset management firm, shared his view with Cointelegraph:

“Bitcoin’s price is up significantly in 2019 [as there are] more buyers than sellers on a net basis this year.”

As the trading volume and market capitalization increased throughout the second quarter of the year, Bitcoin led the market with a 165% gain as its price surged from $4,103 to $10,888. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s market dominance increased from 54.6% to 65%.

Among the reasons that have promoted Bitcoin’s continued growth despite a struggling market is the view that the digital currency can act as a hedge in the wake of increasing global uncertainty. This year, the U.S.–China trade war saw most investors look to Bitcoin and gold as hedges. Pompliano also told Cointelegraph that there were other contributing factors:

“The biggest moments probably revolve around the announcement of Libra and the subsequent reactions, both positive and negative, from various folks across the traditional and cryptocurrency markets.”

However, it was not all sunshine for Bitcoin in 2019. Over the third quarter of the year, a bearish outlook emerged as Bitcoin’s price decreased significantly as 100 billion in market capitalization was lost. Fortunately, even as the market struggled to gain ground against the bears, Bitcoin not only closed the quarter with the least amount of loss but also increased its market dominance by 5.4%. Ultimately, of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s performance has been the best so far.

Compared to assets from other markets, Bitcoin’s performance throughout the year is still far from tenuous. For instance, even though gold is regarded as a reliable store of value, its price has only increased by 17% since January. Even the S&P 500 Index, although with an excellent performance of +21%, is still dwarfed by Bitcoin’s growth throughout the year. Beyond price, Bobby Lee, CEO of the Ballet crypto wallet, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has benefited from several major technological developments:

“2019 was a great year for Bitcoin bulls because of the advances in the open-source ecosystem. Lightning Network is increasing Bitcoin’s transaction capacity, wallets with built-in, user-friendly features (Wasabi, Samourai) are improving privacy.”

Gods Unchained’s rise to popularity

According to reports, Gods Unchained, a blockchain-based virtual card game built on Ethereum, emerged as one of the highest-grossing and most popular blockchain games in 2019. This came about after the platform completely sold out its Genesis Card Pack to the tune of about $6.2 million. This came about after Blizzard, the creators of Hearthstone (a digital trading card game) banned Hearthstone player Chung Ng Wai (also known as Blitzchung) for expressing support for the Hong Kong protests. The Hearthstone game developer also stripped Blitzchung of his winnings.

In addition to the backlash received from the gaming community, Blizzard’s actions were criticized in a tweet by Gods Unchained that claimed Blizzard “care[s] about money more than freedom.” Gods Unchained also promised to compensate Blitzchung for his lost winnings while offering him an invitation to their $500,000 tournament.

The tweet by Gods Unchained was retweeted over 10,000 times, and Google searches for the game have since surged. Unlike Hearthstone, Gods Unchained is decentralized and uses blockchain to ensure that players truly own in-game items and have the freedom to trade them at will.

In a move to give online game players long-term incentives, James Ferguson, CEO of Gods Unchained said that the game is “leveling up the outdated practices of the gaming industry.”

Coinbase’s continued expansion

In the past, Coinbase maintained a reputation for employing a rather selective strategy for adding coins to its exchange. As one of the big league exchanges in the crypto space, Coinbase is also known for having significantly fewer large-scale hacks. In a year that saw other major exchanges like Binance fall victim to large scale security breaches, leading to the loss of thousands of Bitcoin, Coinbase stands out as a reliable and safe platform.

However, the company was heavily scrutinized by Twitter users this year over its acquisition of Neutrino, a startup that collects cryptocurrency transactional data using the blockchain. For most Twitter users, this move seems to facilitate the exchange’s spying on its customers.

However, Coinbase’s move to acquire Neutrino is, according to a Coinbase blog post, part of its goal to support all assets while complying with applicable laws. In addition to acquiring Neutrino, Coinbase has doubled the number of listed cryptocurrencies on its exchange since 2018. Coinbase’s aggressive listing approach has seen the addition of coins such as Dash, Cosmos and Waves, to mention just a few.

The company has almost constantly been making news throughout the year, from making acquisitions to denying them, as well as securing multiple patents along the way. Meanwhile, Coinbases’s Visa debit card solution has also seen exponential growth this year, now available for use in even more countries.

In May 2019, the company also expanded its reach to more than 100 countries while making its USDC stable coin — previously only available in the U.S. — available in 85 of those supported countries. In comparison, Coinbase was only available in about 32 countries last year. Its aggressive expansion appears to be in direct competition to other global players like Binance.

Binance ventures further

Ask any market analyst and they will admit that initial exchange offerings have grown into a big business in 2019. Reports have revealed a high demand for IEOs right from Q1 2019 to Q3, not to mention the fact that they collectively raised over $1.5 billion in the first half of 2019 alone. Unlike initial coin offerings, the biggest determining factor for a successful IEO is the availability of liquidity, and what better way to access liquidity than launching an IEO on a popular exchange.

That is why Binance and its native cryptocurrency BNB have had one of the best years yet. As one of the biggest marketplaces for digital assets, Binance enjoys a significant share of the trading volume. The exchange’s performance has been so exceptional that the Binance Coin has gained value by 150% over the year. When taking everything into account and considering year-on-year growth, Binance Coin has even slightly outperformed Bitcoin.

Also, Binance expanded its reach with the launch of a fully independent U.S. arm of its trading platform. Despite heavy regulatory pressure that keeps the Binance exchange in the U.S. from operating in states such as New York, the company’s partnership with BAM, a registered money service in the U.S., has so far given the exchange some leeway.

The losers

Facebook’s uncertain Libra launch in 2020

Facebook’s announcement of its Libra cryptocurrency has been one of the major events of 2019. However, on the unveiling of Libra as a stablecoin backed by a select number of national currencies, U.S. lawmakers reacted with skepticism, summoning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to multiple hearings.

Related: What Is Libra? Breaking Down Facebook’s New Digital Currency

At its core, Libra is a stablecoin backed by real money and lets users buy, sell and send money at nearly zero fees across borders. According to the project’s white paper, Libra’s overall mission is “to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers millions of people.”

Libra’s white paper further claims that it will use “a new decentralized blockchain, a low volatility cryptocurrency, and a smart contract platform” to empower about 1.7 billion unbanked people. This will be achieved through the use of Facebook’s WhatsApp, Messenger and Calibra, which is a digital wallet designed for Libra users.

Despite Libra’s ambitious plan to empower the unbanked, the Libra project has not only come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers but also faced internal problems of its own. While sharing his thoughts with Cointelegraph, Ballet wallet’s Lee expressed optimism about Libra, saying that although “legislators and regulators in the United States and Europe understand that non-government currencies are a threat to their power, government opposition will diminish over time.” Lee further explained:

“Governments will change their stance because they will come to understand that they can’t control or stop Bitcoin, and they will prefer to have their citizens use centralized corporate coins that can easily be regulated, monitored, and pegged to fiat currency.”

Despite Libra’s ambitious plan to empower the unbaked, the Libra project has not only come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers but also faced internal problems of its own.

The U.S. Congress has asked Facebook to pause further development of the Libra projects, and cynics now believe that the project will not get out of the starting blocks without the government’s approval. Multiple European countries have also spoken out against the proposed cryptocurrency, while China announced that it will soon launch its own stablecoin, a national central bank digital currency, likely as a retaliatory measure. Furthermore, in the wake of increased scrutiny from government regulators, some of Libra’s high profile backers like Visa, eBay, MasterCard and PayPal have abandoned the project.

A rocky year for Circle

In October 2018, Circle, a cryptocurrency firm based in Boston and backed by Goldman Sachs teamed up with Coinbase to launch the Centre consortium. Counting on its reputation as one of the most well-funded crypto startups, the two companies aimed to help accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies. Through the Centre consortium, Coinbase and Circle would increase liquidity to the crypto industry through the issue of a stable coin called the USD Coin.

In July this year, Coinbase and Circle broadened participation into their consortium in a move that will allow other financial entities interested in the project to issue the USD Coin. In the announcement, the Centre network mentioned that “a natural next step is to imagine a new global digital currency” that would include a basket of tokens backed by a variety of stablecoins. Simply put, Centre’s plan is to go with a Facebook-like approach to create a global currency.

However, Circle has had a rocky experience throughout 2019. Even though the USD Coin has received a positive reception, with Centre claiming that the stablecoin has been used to clear on-chain transfers worth over $11 billion, Circle closed its mobile app, reduced its fundraising goal by 40%, and laid off 10% of its staff between May and June this year. Just recently, the company let go of 10 more of its employees, citing efforts to streamline its services.

The latest news of layoffs from Circle comes after the recent transition of the company’s co-founder Sean Neville from his position as CEO to a seat at the company’s board of directors. However, a representative of Circle has denied any connections between the recent layoffs and Sean’s transition, telling Cointelegraph that:

“None of this is related to Sean transitioning out of the co-CEO role. Sean will continue to serve on Circle’s board.”

Craig Wright’s court battles

When Australian-born technologist Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2015, most people in the crypto community were skeptical and thought nothing of it.

Most people expected that the Satoshi Nakamoto impersonator would have scurried back into obscurity by now. However, Wright and his claims have continued to headline the news throughout 2019. Wright claims that he invented Bitcoin a decade ago and mined over 1 million BTC along with his late business partner Dave Kleiman. After Kleiman’s death in 2013, Wright claims that he put the mined Bitcoin in the “Tulip Trust.”

However, the Australian entrepreneur and computer scientist was sued by Kleiman’s estate in 2018 for allegedly stealing up to 1 million Bitcoin. In the past, it is said that Wright and Kleiman worked together on mining and developing Bitcoin. According to Kleiman’s family, Wright stole between 550,000 to 1 million Bitcoin — worth about $10 billion.

The ongoing case led to Magistrate Judge Bruce’s ruling that ordered Wright to turn over half of his Bitcoin holdings and intellectual property from before 2014 to Kleiman’s estate, presuming he is indeed Nakamoto. On Oct. 31, the trials re-emerged after Wright pulled out of the settlement agreement to forfeit half his Bitcoin and intellectual property.

In addition to his court battles, Wright was scrutinized by the crypto community after presenting what was considered forged documents as evidence of him being Nakamoto in another case of Wright against Peter McCormack. Wright’s case against McCormack is based on the fact that McCormack’s repeated statement that Wright is not Satoshi is harmful to Wright’s reputation. Most recently, Wright presented another document that allegedly proves how he came up with the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym.

Bitcoin ETF’s continual rejection by the SEC

Even though U.S. regulators have always left a window for the possibility of approving Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the future, up until now, every single attempt to license a Bitcoin ETF has been met with failure. In October this year, an ETF proposal filed by Bitwise Asset Management in conjunction with NYSE Arca was rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to meet legal requirements that prevent illicit market manipulation.

In fact, all Bitcoin ETF proposals presented to the SEC have been rejected on concerns about fraudulent activities and market manipulation. One of the main criteria for approving an ETF is establishing the underlying market of a new commodity-based ETF.

Related: The SEC Does Not Want Crypto ETFs — What Will It Take to Get Approval?

If the underlying market is resistant to manipulation, regulators can give the ETF the go-ahead. Given the complexities of the Bitcoin market, it seems approval from the SEC is unlikely. Despite the earlier rejection of Bitwise’s application, the SEC later announced that it would review Bitwise’s proposal once again.

While speaking to Cointelegraph on the realistic timeline of the first Bitcoin ETF approval, Charles Lu, the CEO of the Findora fintech toolkit provider said, “For a Bitcoin ETF proposal to gain SEC approval, the sponsor will need to prove that real price discovery is happening as opposed to market manipulations.” In Lu’s opinion, this will not happen anywhere soon, since the SEC would require “surveillance sharing agreements” with the big exchanges.

2019 and 2020

Overall, the crypto industry has shown some significant growth over the past year. Although volatile, Bitcoin is showing significant signs of growth. More institutional investors are looking into the industry to find more ways to invest as well. Even though there is a downtrend in market cap and trading volumes, prominent traders believe that a turn of fate might just be around the corner, especially for Bitcoin holders.

Out of all the winners and losers of 2019, perhaps Facebook Libra is one that stands to be most impactful in 2020. For most onlookers, it will be interesting to see whether Facebook’s Libra project will turn a new leaf and launch successfully in 2020. If it does, there is a high likelihood that big changes will take place throughout the entire industry.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/debate-ensues-after-68-of-bch-hashrate-mined-by-stealth-miners/,"Debate Ensues After 68% of BCH Hashrate Mined by Stealth Miners

2019 was known for the growing trend of stealth miners mining on the BTC and BCH network. On Dec. 30, data shows that 68% of the Bitcoin Cash network’s hashrate is being mined by mystery miners. As the year comes to an end, the large number of unknown BCH hashrate has attracted scrutiny.

68% of the BCH Hashrate Was Recently Processed by Unknown Miners

On Monday, a post on the Reddit forum r/btc explained that “untrusted hash is at nearly 70%.” The r/btc thread detailed that on Dec. 30, statistics indicate that roughly 68% of the overall BCH hashrate is being processed by miners not willing to disclose their identity. When a known mining pool finds a block, in the coinbase there’s usually a message which identifies who mined the block. However, in 2019 both SHA-256 networks BTC and BCH saw a significant increase in mystery miners processing the chains. In January, two research reports noticed the increasing trend of unknown miners as Coin Metrics and Diar both published findings on the subject. At the time, Diar’s report said that unknown miners could be “concerning” and just because the miner does not disclose its identity, it doesn’t mean the hash is not from a known pool. Coin Metrics wrote that the analytics firm also noticed a resurgence of mystery miners during the start of 2019.

A few weeks before the Bitcoin Cash upgrade that took place on Nov. 15, BCH proponents discovered 44% of the BCH hashrate was processed by unknown miners. At the time, speculators assumed the stealth hash belonged to roughly 3-4 different pools. The reason for the theory is because there are unique messages in the block’s coinbase for each unknown mining entity. Today, there are a few coinbase messages that read: “d B ^//bf Oe?D 5F” and another pool uses this message: “^//KFy{Ʊ!+.” Besides clues like the different coinbase messages, no one truly knows who is behind the unknown BCH hashrate. During the discussion on r/btc, a few individuals took issue with calling the unknown miners “untrusted.” “‘Untrusted hash’… isn’t that how it’s supposed to be?” a person asked on the Reddit forum and also left a quote from Satoshi’s white paper that said:

We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust.

Are Stealth Miners Untrustworthy?

The Reddit user dubbed ‘Lovelyday,’ the BCH supporter who wrote the original post, responded to the critique for using the term “untrusted.” “Sure, the ‘ideal’ situation in Bitcoin would be if every miner were unknown, and Bitcoins were so valuable that there’d be absolute incentive for the majority of the hash to protect the Bitcoin that observes the economic model laid out in the white paper,” Lovelyday said. “Comparing against where we are today… we are a little ways off, with historical precedent for hashpower actually trying to destroy Bitcoin Cash — That’s why I used the term ‘untrusted’ as a blanket term for the unidentified hashrate that is > 50% — We can’t trust them, neither should we,” the Redditor added. Lovelyday further stated:

Should we trust the identified hashrate? Probably not much more, but at least we can compare their actions to their stated intentions, and hold them to account by switching to pools that act in ways we prefer.

A few other BCH supporters disagreed and stressed that the Nov. 15, 2018 hash war that created BSV was the perfect example. “A 51% attack would be extraordinarily expensive to sustain on a network as large as BCH — And it wouldn’t work because of all the miners that support us,” another individual commented on the thread. In addition to the stealth miners processing hash on the BCH network, a growing number of unknown miners are mining BTC and BSV as well. At the time of writing, BTC hashrate distribution shows 26% of the hashpower is being processed by unknown pools and there’s 30% on the BSV network today.

Dave the Wave, a prominent technical analyst on Twitter, recently noted that he expects Bitcoin prices to tighten in the first half of 2020, then break out in the second half of next year to near the $20,000 all-time high. By early-2021, he expects the price of the leading cryptocurrency to have posted “new sustainable all-time highs.”

End of year prediction.

New sustainable ATHs early 2021. pic.twitter.com/ldMTJMAMR7 — dave the wave (@davthewave) December 30, 2019

In a previous analysis, Dave used Elliot Wave to determine that while BTC may see some bearish price action in the near term, the asset will soon restart its long-term bull trend. This analysis led Dave to suggest that BTC will bottom in the low-$6,000s by around February 2020, then surge to $25,000 or so — some 250% higher than current prices — by the start of 2021.

So what are Dave’s credentials? Why should we listen to a Twitter analyst whose avatar is the famous Japanese painting of a tsunami?

Well, this trader is the one that called for rationality to return to the crypto markets when BTC was trading above $10,000, claiming the move was a clear overextension of BTC’s long-term growth curve and standards. He went as far as to say that Bitcoin was poised to return to $6,700 — this was months ago.

Other Prominent Bitcoin Analysts Agree

Dave’s analysis lines up with the opinions of two prominent investment fund managers in the crypto industry: Travis Kling, current CIO of Ikigai Asset Management and former Point 72 portfolio manager, and Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital. Both of these prominent Bitcoin analysts have asserted in recent interviews that they believe that the leading cryptocurrency will top $20,000 and hit a new all-time high by the early-2021 region.

Speaking to CNN’s Julia Chatterley in a recent segment for “First Move” in October, the former Wall Streeter turned cryptocurrency fund manager and investor, Novogratz said that he expects for Bitcoin to hit $20,000 in 18 months’ time. This would represent a 180% move from current levels if it plays out.

This came shortly after Kling said that by late-2020 or early-2021 — around 18 months from now — the Bitcoin price is likely to have surmounted its previous all-time high to establish a new one.

This is purportedly backed by fundamentals. Per previous reports from Ethereum World News, prominent investors believe that events like the Bitcoin block reward reduction (which will amount to a negative supply shock for the market) and the adoption of the Lightning Network and other prominent Bitcoin-based applications will push this market higher due to increased demand for an increasingly scarce asset.

Featured Image from Unsplash",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-crackdown-on-cryptocurrency-trading-a-2019-recap,"While China has waged war on domestic cryptocurrency trading activities since 2017, this year saw it tighten the screws as hype around crypto’s underlying blockchain technology renewed interest in digital assets. Below is a summary of China’s difficult relationship with crypto and how it has evolved in 2019.

China does not like crypto trading

As Cointelegraph reported in September 2017, Chinese regulators placed a ban on local cryptocurrency exchanges, forcing them to close. Shortly after the ban, news broke that the government sought to crack down on all domestic cryptocurrency trading, not just commercial exchanges.

At the beginning of 2018, local authorities also started taking action against market-making platforms and other “exchange-like” services that interacted with cryptocurrencies.

After finally completing the crackdown on local cryptocurrency trading businesses, China started adding offshore cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offering websites to its so-called Great Firewall.

Still, the ban proved ineffective as reports started circulating that Chinese cryptocurrency traders continued their activities by using virtual private networks to bypass the firewall. More recent reports suggest China’s fight against cryptocurrency trading has not yet ended.

Related: Five Countries Where Crypto Regulation Changed the Most in 2019

In late November, reports suggested that at least five Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges had halted or chosen to terminate operations. During the same month, Shenzhen authorities identified a total of 39 exchanges that broke China’s cryptocurrency trading ban and initiated corrective measures against them.

Blockchain, not Bitcoin

Despite its hardline stance on cryptocurrencies, the Chinese government has expressed clear support for crypto’s underlying blockchain technology, with President Xi Jinping calling on the country’s innovators to prioritize its development.

While official endorsements have increased the hype surrounding blockchain, state media have warned the public against speculation in cryptocurrencies.

Confusingly enough, following President Xi’s call to action, the state-run Xinhua News Agency published a report recognizing Bitcoin (BTC) as “the first successful application of blockchain technology.”

Indeed, Chinese regulators worry that the endorsement of crypto’s underlying ledger may result in renewed interest in cryptocurrency-related activities. Earlier this week, securities regulators issued a warning for local companies, stating that the Chinese government plans to renew its crackdown on cryptocurrency trading. This month, China also hinted that its treatment of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin may change again as it looks to reform its forex markets.

Overall, the Chinese government seems to like the safe data management potential of blockchain, but not its decentralized and permissionless nature as well as the speculation enabled by crypto assets. As Coinitelegraph recently reported, the deputy director of China’s central bank Mu Changchun said that the digital yuan will be different from Bitcoin and stablecoins in that it will just be a digital form of the currency, and will not allow for speculation.",,https://decrypt.co/15686/bitcoin-ethereum-are-most-profitable-investments-of-the-decade,"As the decade draws to a close, it's time to look at the investments that were the most successful. And, unsurprisingly, cryptocurrencies top the list of the most profitable investments of the decade.

Up first, is Bitcoin. The first cryptocurrency, built by an anonymous programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it led to the creation of many Bitcoin forks—alternative versions running on similar code—and thousands of altcoins, either using the same code or trying out new features. But, if you got in early, you had the chance to make a quick buck.

Since the first bitcoin was available for trading, its price has accelerated 62,500 percent. Outshining many traditional stocks, it even spawned an entire culture built around prices ""mooning"" and the promise of lovingly labelled ""lambos."" Due to the extreme rise, many critics have called it a Ponzi Scheme and say that its price pumps are bubbles that keep popping. But despite the criticism, an entire industry has been built around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, leading many countries around the world to start adoption blockchain technology.

Much of the promise of blockchain technology can be seen with Ethereum. It offers features known as smart contracts, which allow for the creation of decentralized apps. These have interesting applications, particularly in the world of finance.

The price of Ethereum has shot up too. Even though the price has dropped heavily since its all-time high in January 2018, the price of Ethereum is still up by 17,900 percent. One ETH is currently worth $132.

However, some traditional stocks have not been far off. Netflix had a strong performance this decade, rising 4,280 percent. It's not too surprising given how ubiquitous it now is. Even new films are now launching on Netflix instead of heading to the cinema. But it's epic rise has led to an increase in the number of competitor video streaming companies. Will it be able to fend off the competition going into 2020?

Along with the rise of Netflix, and watching TV at home in general, another company did particularly well. Domino's Pizza saw an increase in share price of 3,000 percent. Who knew pizza and TV were a winning combination?

In line with the trend of not needing to go outside, Amazon grew considerably in the last decade, rising 1,250 percent. It's worth noting that not only does Amazon ship products to your door but it also offers a TV streaming service. What's next, Amazon pizza?

Those doing yoga, trying to work off the 1,000 calorie pizzas, helped to boost the price of Lululemon shares, a retailer known for creating activewear and clothes for ""most other sweaty pursuits."" They rose by 1,300 percent.

On a different track, healthcare company Abiomed saw a 2,000 percent rise in the last decade. It creates medical devices, such as artificial hearts.

Shotly behind Amazon is NVIDIA, known for creating computer chips. Interestingly, it pulled in $1.95 billion in revenue from its crypto mining business. But it wasn't without controversy. In September, critics accused it of surreptitiously influencing the development of an upgrade to the Ethereum network. But nothing was ever proved.

Other profitable investments of the decade were payments processors, including Mastercard and VISA, up 1,100 percent and 760 percent respectively. Google shares rose by 350 percent and Apple shares went up by 840 percent.",2019-12-30 14:05:26,https://news.bitcoin.com/wazirx-ceo-on-2020-outlook-rbi-ban-crypto-regulation-for-india/,"Wazirx CEO on 2020 Outlook, RBI Ban, Crypto Regulation for India

The Indian crypto community has had an eventful year, with a bill on the horizon, the RBI ban’s supreme court hearing, and the community’s efforts toward positive crypto regulation. News.Bitcoin.com interviewed Nischal Shetty, CEO of local crypto exchange Wazirx, about what the Indian crypto industry could expect in the year 2020 and a wide range of other crypto topics.

Also read: Regulatory Roundup – New US Crypto Bill, France’s 1st Approved ICO, Muslim Crypto

News.Bitcoin.com (BC): How did you first get involved in crypto? What attracted you to the industry?

Nischal Shetty (NS): I’ve been on and off learning/understanding crypto since 2009. But I got deep into it only in 2017. The “permissionless” aspect of crypto is what attracted me to this industry. Imagine being able to build what you want without needing to rely on any other person or company. This aspect of crypto will lead to innovations in finance and tech that has never been possible in traditional financial systems.

BC: How will crypto benefit India?

NS: There are millions of ways in which crypto will immensely benefit India. To keep my answer short, the three prominent benefits would be:

1. Employment and entrepreneurship:

Hundreds of crypto startups will emerge the moment the Indian government takes a positive step forward in crypto. This will, in turn, lead to thousands of new jobs in the country.

2. Access to cheaper capital:

The interest rates in India are higher than in most other countries. Crypto has the power to provide access to cheaper capital in India.

3. Banking the unbanked:

There are over 300 million unbanked in India. Traditional banking requires physical infrastructure thus making it difficult and expensive to reach all parts of India.

Crypto can penetrate faster and involve such unbanked people in the online financial ecosystem.

BC: How would Facebook’s Libra benefit India? Is India likely to allow Libra in the country?

NS: India has tons of freelancers working for clients across the world. Libra can help them accept payment from anyone anywhere in the world for the work they’ve done.

Libra can provide financial inclusion to those in India who do not have access to traditional banking.

It’s going to be an uphill task for Facebook to get Libra accepted in India. But I really hope the Indian government looks at the merits of such initiatives and allows it.

BC: What do you think of the RBI introducing a digital currency? Do you think a central bank digital currency would benefit India?

Yeah, it would definitely benefit India and Indians. I’m more excited about the fact that a CBDC [central bank digital currency] could open the gates for innovation with developers not only in India but around the world building wallets and other products for such a currency. This would mean more choices for the Indian consumer.

BC: Do you think the Supreme Court will lift the RBI ban? If so, when do you think that will happen?

I really hope they do. I think we’ll see some solid progress with the case in 2020 as the matter has reached a stage where it’s being heard in court.

BC: Why do you think the government has not introduced a crypto bill yet? Do you think the government will still go ahead with the draft bill to ban crypto?

NS: The Indian government will not rush into a bill without understanding the technology and discussing it with the crypto industry. This is the major reason why the proposed draft bill has not been considered.

We’re confident that our leaders will engage with the crypto industry of India and then progress in the right direction.

BC: Do you think the government will eventually introduce positive crypto regulation? If so, when do you think that will happen?

NS: I absolutely think they will introduce positive crypto regulations. It might happen in 2021/2022 depending on the pace of regulations in other countries, especially U.S. India will wait and watch other progressive nations before making any regulatory moves in crypto.

BC: What are the most important things the Indian government should realize about crypto?

NS:

1. Crypto is one of the most innovative technologies of this decade.

2. India should get in ASAP so that we build the much-needed expertise in crypto.

3. India will see a boost in jobs if we promote crypto technology.

4. India can attract billions of dollars worth of investment if it opens up to crypto.

5. Indian startups can get access to a larger capital pool if India brings about favorable ICO regulations.

BC: Looking ahead, what should the crypto industry in India expect in the year 2020?

NS: 1. Crypto exchanges in India will see even greater competition as exchanges around the world start competing for the Indian audience. India is a sleeping giant in the crypto space and everyone wants to capture a piece of this market early.

2. We’ll see lawmakers taking positive steps towards understanding crypto and involve the industry to formulate the right set of crypto regulations.

3. DeFi will take off in a big way in India.

4. A lot more Indian developers will take interest in building for the decentralized internet.

5. At least one crypto company will hit $10M+ in revenue encouraging more startups in this space.

BC: What are the latest developments for Wazirx after the Binance acquisition? What has changed/improved?

NS: Wazirx has gotten international exposure now thanks to Binance. The Wazirx brand has become way more popular globally than it was before.

We’re in the process of a deep P2P integration into Binance that will allow Indians to easily buy/sell crypto with INR right within Binance.

Binance believes in providing complete independence to the teams within the company. That has been true for Wazirx where we still operate as an independent entity. However, we’ve gotten access to so much talent that exists within Binance that our execution speed has increased immensely. If we hit any roadblocks, there’s always someone within Binance who knows how to help out.

Expect a lot more speed and new stuff faster from Wazirx now that we’ve been acquired by Binance. We want to grow the crypto ecosystem in India and we’re confident we’ll be able to do that with help from Binance.

BC: How is the “India Wants Crypto” campaign going?

NS: It’s going really well. Every day more and more people in India and around the world get to know about this campaign. The campaign has been able to spread the right information about crypto throughout India.

I’ll continue to run the campaign as it has gone above the initial objective of being heard by lawmakers to now being a symbol of hope for crypto in India.

We need to keep spreading this awareness and I’m sure a time will come when we’ll be heard by our lawmakers as well.

Do you agree with Shetty? Do you think the supreme court will lift the RBI ban at the next hearing in January? Do you think the Indian government will introduce positive regulation for the crypto industry in 2020? Let us know in the comments section below.

China’s Blockchain ETF and Crypto Warnings

The China Securities Regulatory Commission revealed on Dec. 24 that it had received an application for a blockchain exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Shenzhen-based asset manager Penghua Fund. According to Chinese media, if successfully launched, this fund will be China’s first blockchain ETF. It will track the performance of the blockchain index recently launched by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one of the two key stock exchanges in mainland China. The index comprises stocks of the largest 50 companies listed on the exchange with blockchain ventures, ranked by market capitalization.

On the same day, Reuters reported that China will expand the scope of its blockchain cross-border financing pilot platform. The government will also “push forward a prospective study on foreign exchange reforms to deal with cryptocurrency and explore the construction of the foreign exchange regulation and technology system under the new situation,” explained Lu Lei, deputy head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.

While blockchain friendly after President Xi Jinping openly advocated for the technology, the authorities in China continue to scrutinize crypto businesses. On Dec. 27, four regulators in Beijing jointly issued a warning regarding cryptocurrency trading and related activities in their jurisdictions. It reiterates the September 2017 announcement made by seven Chinese ministries, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), which led to the closing of crypto and initial coin offering (ICO) trading platforms in the country. Recently, the PBOC’s Shanghai Head Office also issued a similar notice reminding people that the seven ministries’ order is still effective.

The crypto mining industry is also under scrutiny by Chinese regulators. In Sichuan, the authorities went after crypto miners to save electricity in the dry season. In the city of Tangshan, Hebei province, the police recently seized 6,890 bitcoin mining rigs and arrested a group of scammers.

Russian Supreme Court Recognizes Tokens as Assets Like Money or Property

The Russian supreme court has clarified that “digital rights,” the term currently used to describe cryptocurrencies and tokens in Russian law, can be a subject of bribes similar to fiat money, property, and other assets. While Russia currently does not have a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, various institutions in the country, including the courts, have previously characterized them as “money surrogates” which are banned by Russian law.

Meanwhile, Russia’s central bank has reportedly begun testing stablecoins in its regulatory sandbox. Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina explained to local publication Interfax on Dec. 25 that the bank looks at companies wanting to issue tokens secured by some real assets, “but we do not assume that they will function as a means of payment and become money surrogate,” she emphasized.

Regarding central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which many countries are discussing, “we are also at the stage of studying this topic,” the governor revealed. However, she noted that “First of all, we need to understand what will be the advantages for our citizens, for businesses,” compared to other options.

France Publishes New Crypto Rules

France’s financial markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF), published its new rules for digital asset service providers (DASPs) on Dec. 20. They define the types of services that are considered DASPs under the new regulatory framework adopted in April and clarify which specific rules apply to crypto or ICO services. The regulator detailed that registration is mandatory for two types of crypto activities, elaborating:

If you provide services of digital asset custody and/or buying or selling digital assets for legal tender in France, you must register with the AMF.

Registrants must be established in France. They will be checked for compliance with the regulations on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The AMF also recently approved the first public ICO in France.

Japan Hosting World DeFi Conference

Japan’s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), announced on Dec. 23 that it is organizing the Blockchain Global Governance Conference in collaboration with Nikkei Inc. The event is in response to the consensus reached by the international regulatory community “on the importance of engaging with various stakeholders in the decentralized financial ecosystem to ensure public policy objectives,” as stated in the G20 Osaka Leaders’ Declaration under Japan’s presidency in June, the agency detailed.

The conference welcomes stakeholders from all around the world, including “those who are active in open-source software communities, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger.” University researchers, relevant organizations, businesses in the space, civil society and financial regulators are also invited. According to the FSA, the event aims to “discuss the better governance for decentralized financial ecosystem.”

Uzbekistan’s Crypto Ban

Uzbekistan has banned crypto buying. The country’s National Agency for Project Management has recently adopted amendments to the regulatory regime that place significant restrictions on local private individuals using cryptocurrency. The agency issued an order on Dec. 6 stating that Uzbekistan citizens will only be allowed to sell crypto assets on registered exchanges. Using decentralized cryptocurrencies as a means of payment is now also prohibited in the country.

Furthermore, any transactions involving coins acquired through anonymous means are banned. However, the regulator has not clarified how it plans to determine whether someone’s digital money has been involved in such transfers. Further, crypto trading platforms should only serve verified users of 18 years or older whose names are not on the government’s list of those suspected of money laundering and terrorist financing.

CBDCs in Korea, Japan, and the Bahamas

Besides Russia, three more countries made some announcements regarding their CBDC progress last week. The Central Bank of the Bahamas started a pilot program of a digital version of the Bahamian dollar on Dec. 27 in Exuma, which will be extended to Abaco in the first half of 2020. The bank described:

As the pilot progresses in Exuma, the central bank will simultaneously promote the development of new regulations for the digital currency, and strengthen consumer protection, especially around data protection standards.

The central bank added that it “will also advance reforms to permit direct participation of non-banks in the domestic payments system. Early passage of the new Central Bank of the Bahamas Bill will support the creation of some regulations, while additional reforms will be possible under the existing Payment Systems Act.”

Another country that has been studying the benefits of issuing a CBDC is South Korea. While repeatedly declaring that it is not currently considering issuing one, the Bank of Korea (BOK) is reportedly organizing a task force dedicated to CBDC research, local media reported on Friday. In its “Monetary Policy for 2020” report, the BOK revealed that it will continue to build on research into innovations, including distributed ledger technology, crypto assets, and CBDC. “We will actively engage in discussions with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and other international organizations, keeping an eye on CBDC development at other central banks,” the BOK wrote. The central bank also said it will recruit additional CBDC experts and proceeded to post a job opening for digital currency experts on Dec. 10.

Similarly, Japan is another Asian country actively researching the impact of a CBDC on the current system without committing to issuing one. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) published a summary report on Dec. 24 outlining the legal implications of a CBDC in the country. The report highlights a wide range of issues which need be addressed, including whether a CBDC can be regarded as legal tender, ways to combat its counterfeit or duplication, whether its issuance is consistent with the Bank of Japan Act, and whether the central bank can restrict its use by certain individuals. Other issues concern AML/CFT regulations, protecting personal information, and the penalties for counterfeiting or duplicating CBDC under current criminal law. “By clarifying these potential legal issues spanning various legal fields, the report intends to stimulate further discussion regarding CBDC,” the BOJ concluded.

Despite the harsh market conditions this year, high profile closures of a few ventures and a lot of employee downsizing, the number of companies operating in the blockchain and cryptocurrency fields in Israel actually grew by 32% in 2019.

Israeli Blockchain Industry Survives Crypto Winter

As of December 2019, 150 active blockchain and crypto companies are operating in Israel, an increase of 32% compared with only 113 companies at the end of 2018. This is according to a survey by the Israeli Bitcoin Association which was first reported by local financial newspaper Globes.

The 2019 growth rate is a moderate figure compared to the strong growth seen in 2018, when the number of Israeli companies operating in the sector more than doubled, increasing by 113% from just 53 companies at the end of 2017. The situation in the blockchain field this year was also tame in comparison to the wider Israeli high tech scene. For example, the general tech industry in Israel saw the number of unicorns (private ventures worth more than $1 billion) rise from 11 to 20 this year and the total value of exits double from 2018 to $9.9 billion in 2019, according to a recent report by accounting firm PWC.

In the survey conducted by the Bitcoin Association, it was found that out of the 113 companies operating in the industry at the end of 2018, 63 companies still continue to operate in the field today – while information on the activities of the other companies is not available. This means that, according to the available data, it is possible that half of Israeli companies in the blockchain and crypto business did not survive during the past year or changed the nature of their operations to other areas. The association notes that the survey data includes all local companies operating in these areas, although they are not necessarily those with blockchain technology at the core of their activities. Many of these companies officially focus on other areas, such as software development, fintech or cyber, for example, and combine their main business with some blockchain or crypto activity.

The Bitcoin Association does not provide data on the change in the number of employees in Israeli companies in the blockchain field compared to previous years, nor on the change in the amount of total funds raised by those companies. However, according to company reports revealed over the passing year by the newspaper, in most blockchain companies the number of employees decreased significantly this year, and capital raising was very weak compared to previous years. This is not surprising as many ventures in Israel brought in staggering amount of money from investors during the ICO bubble and had to adapt to stay in business when it popped.

Over 90 Companies Are Based in Tel Aviv

The survey also found that most Israeli companies in the sector are newer startups, operating for no more than three years. According to the available data, 30% of active companies were founded in 2017 and another 30% in 2018. The oldest local companies in the field were founded in 2012 (a total of four such companies remained active this year), while only six companies were established in the past year (4% of all companies).

The figures indicate that most companies operating in the industry are relatively small, and employ no more than 10 employees. According to data from the Bitcoin Association, 65% of companies report that they employ up to 10 employees, 31% employ between 11 and 50 employees, and only four companies (less than 3%) employ between 50 and 200 employees.

In terms of sources of financing for companies operating with blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Israel, the Bitcoin Association found that 44% of companies operate only on a self-funding basis. Additionally, 42% of these companies raised funding at some level: 34% got seed funding, about 1% of companies completed round A funding and 6% completed round B funding. Also, 7% of companies are using their own revenues to finance their activities.

Looking at the geographical spread of the Israeli blockchain industry across the country, it was found in the survey that 91 out of the 150 Israeli companies in the field operate in Tel Aviv, nine in Herzliya, six in Jerusalem, six in Netanya, and the rest in other cities or towns. In terms of the level of technology maturity, the survey found that 40% of the companies have already released a product to the market, 25% are still in the research and development stage, 10% have an alpha product and 19% developed a product in beta.

Reported by the Asia Times, the authorities are not only going after the mining operators but also after the power stations for supplying electricity to these businesses.

This month, authorities slapped a total fine of $140,000 on two power plants in Sichuan as they were supplying electricity to unlicensed mining businesses.

The hub of crypto mining

Sichuan is a province in the southwestern part of China, which receives excessive rain in the wet season, which runs from May to September. This also results in the generation of excessive hydro-based electricity, which is distributed at cheap rates.

Suggested articles Why Crypto Payments Can Change the WorldGo to article >>

Because of the cheap electricity rates, many mining firms flocked to the area and set up operations. However, in the dry season, Sichuan power plants fail to generate enough power required for the entities in the region, creating a power shortage.

Despite having no clear laws in favor of crypto mining, China is still dominating in Bitcoin mining hash rate with two-thirds of the total share, while Sichuan alone contributes over 50 percent. Though the government did not impose any ban on crypto mining, it is in the unwanted industries list.

Building intolerance?

Apart from the local authorities in Sichuan, the regulators in the country’s autonomous region of Inner Mongolia also started a crackdown on the crypto mining industry from last month.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, the Chinese authorities seized 7,000 illegal crypto mining devices from merchants, communities, and other entities within the Kaiping District, part of Tangshan.

Chinese crypto businesses were relieved recently as the government started to embrace blockchain technology. However, authorities soon came out to clarify the difference between blockchain and crypto, continuing its crackdown against the latter.",2019-12-31 10:21:24+00:00,https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/did-youtube-delete-bitcoin-videos-in-a-crypto-purge/,"YouTube, the video-sharing website owned by Google (GOOGL)(GOOG), has a major influence on the world of cryptocurrency. Users discuss Bitcoin (BTC) both in videos and in the comments sections of those videos. So censoring Bitcoin and cryptocurrency videos on the platform would be a devastating blow.

There’s no clear evidence that YouTube deliberately censored Bitcoin videos. However, there’s been an incident that allegedly still hasn’t fully resolved. A large number of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency videos on YouTube went missing, prompting many users to ask questions about what happened.",2019-12-31 17:50:38+00:00,https://marketrealist.com/2019/12/whats-in-store-bitcoin-year-draws-to-close/,"Halving happens when 210,000 new blocks are added to the bitcoin blockchain network. I would rather not get into the math here, but in simple terms, we can compare the process to commodity mining. When a new gold reserve is found, the mining output is high. But as we keep mining, the output deteriorates, as the mine has a limited supply.

Similar is the case with bitcoin. When bitcoin mining started, miners received 50 BTC for mining one block. When the number of blocks reached 210,001, the mining reward halved from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. After 420,001, the prize further halved, to 12.5 BTC, which is the current mining reward. The number of blocks is nearing 630,000, and when this number is reached, the reward will reduce to 6.25 BTC. BitcoinBlockHalf.com estimates the next halving could happen in May 2020. At that time, smaller miners might merge or leave the mining pool altogether.

The whole process of bitcoin mining is changing. As the bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, miners could take several years to mine all of these bitcoins. According to Investopedia, BTC mining could continue until 2140.

While mining rewards are halving, bitcoin prices are rising, keeping miners going. As we said before, supply scarcity drives commodity prices higher.",2019-12-31 16:38:03+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-next-decade-will-be-shaped-by-derivatives/,"Bitcoin’s Next Decade Will Be Shaped by Derivatives

The last five years have been a test phase for bitcoin derivatives, which began tentatively when Bitmex eased into life in 2014. Now, as the cryptoconomy prepares to enter a new decade, derivatives products will play a pivotal role in price discovery. 2020 will be a big year for bitcoin and for the futures markets where billions of dollars will be won and lost, and the next bull market will begin.

A Year of Bitcoin Derivatives Is Dawning

In 2019, crypto futures volumes approached those of spot trading. In 2020, futures are on course to blow right past spot levels and keep on trucking. The success of derivatives platforms Binance Futures and Bitmex, as well as new products from the likes of FTX, Dydx, and Synthetix, has convinced many that 2020 could be the Year of Derivatives. And U.S. regulators are lending credence to the notion: Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the independent regulator that governs the country’s futures and options markets, recently hinted that it could approve a new crypto-based derivative product backed by Ethereum in the course of 2020.

Out-of-the-box products serve to attract new players and new capital to the crypto derivatives market. But will the spate of novel products capture sufficient volume and play a role in shaping bitcoin’s price action in the coming year? And if so, who stands to benefit most?

A Flurry of Derivatives Developments

Singapore exchange Bybit is planning to move into Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese and Spanish markets, Okex’s new USDT-margined Perpetual Swap Trading is likely to gain traction, and decentralized derivatives products are expected to see broader usage as defi adoption continues. Synthetix – the second largest defi app in the Ethereum ecosystem – has just announced a partnership with Chainlink, meaning it no longer needs to rely on centralized price feeds for its derivatives trading mechanism.

Today’s traders are now spoilt for choice, with bitcoin futures trading platforms feeding their appetite for high leverage on an array of digital assets. Traders aren’t limited to BTC and ETH, either: they can long or short altcoins such as cardano, enjin, tomo, and stellar if they’re feeling bold.

Improved fiat-crypto gateways such as Plutus’ virtual bank account and debit card have also increased the appeal of derivatives exchanges to retail investors, who are no longer locked into tether (USDT). Enhanced crypto-fiat conversion means traders can spend or reinvest their profits without needing to jump through multiple hoops. Services like Plutus enable crypto and fiat to be changed within a single app, forming the launchpad and off-ramp for traders seeking exposure to the broader cryptoconomy. Better fiat connections are often overlooked when assessing the health of derivatives markets, but these gateways are vital in driving capital in-flows.

US Futures Markets Heat Up

In terms of institutional interest in bitcoin futures, the U.S., where much of the innovation is happening, will dictate matters. One platform seeking to play a major role is Bakkt, which launched bitcoin options and cash-settled futures in the U.S. at the tail-end of 2019. While the former is the first regulated bitcoin futures contract rubber-stamped by the CFTC, the latter will initially be available via the ICE Futures Singapore exchange. In December, open interest on Bakkt bitcoin futures reached an all-time high of $6.5 million – and with the ascension of CEO Kelly Loeffler to the U.S. Senate, the next 12 months are shaping up to be interesting.

Bakkt isn’t the only platform contributing to a market that has evolved greatly since traders first sought to profit from falling prices during the 2018 downturn. Binance’s bitcoin derivatives surpassed the volumes of its spot offering at various times in 2019, leading the juggernaut to invest an undisclosed sum in derivatives platform FTX. This after it had already acquired spot and derivatives exchange JEX, a move which enabled Binance to add options and futures to its platform.

Speaking of bitcoin derivatives, CME Group’s Tim McCourt recently celebrated the two-year anniversary of the exchange’s operations in this field. In a short article noting the market’s “forward curve,” he revealed that CME had traded over 2.4 million contracts with a notional value exceeding $92 billion from 12.5 million BTC. Some speculate that the growing interest of trading exchanges like Bakkt and CME stems from reduced BTC volatility in comparison to previous years. In any case, the preponderance of such platforms gives derivatives traders plenty of options.

Competition Is Getting Fierce

As derivatives players vie for market share, battlegrounds are coming into clearer focus. Blade, the San Francisco-based exchange supported by Silicon Valley venture capitalists, just announced its commitment to zero-fee trading – a flagrant affront to perpetual swap titan Bitmex. UMA’s Bitdex specification also presents a possible route to non-custodial perpetual swaps, though more work is required to develop this concept.

So what does all this surging activity mean for bitcoin’s price? According to Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of Coinshares, the growth of the crypto derivatives market means that bitcoin’s price is becoming less relevant – which will keep it in check even after the halving. Demirors believes that bitcoin’s evolution into an investable asset will, in effect, decouple its price from both its value and supply and demand. With the crypto derivatives market coming to wider attention, a greater number of investors may also choose to hedge their positions via derivatives to manage price risk, leading to less volatility.

All told, the bitcoin derivatives market looks to be in rude health, even if it remains small when compared to other commodities markets. For one thing, traditional investors are likely to be enticed into crypto as a consequence of their familiarity, since derivatives are routinely used in regular financial markets. In fact, a great many institutional traders have thus far been reluctant to engage with crypto due to a paucity of tools to hedge trades and manage risk. 2020, then, and the decade it heads should bring greater leverage for crypto derivatives, including those in the defi ecosystem, greater liquidity, and greater competition from players old and new.

Yoni Assia is the CEO and founder of multi-asset trading platform Etoro. The brokerage firm, which enjoys a high profile within the cryptosphere, enables digital assets such as BTC and BCH to be traded alongside stocks, ETFs, and commodities. Juxtaposed between the traditional and crypto investment realms, Etoro has a unique insight into the health of the industry. In an interview with news.Bitcoin.com, Yoni Assia shared his thoughts on what traders can expect in 2020.

Also read: Bitcoin’s Next Decade Will Be Shaped by Derivatives



2019 Was a Year of Diversification for Etoro

“We launched commission-free stocks trading this year and we’ve seen a flurry of new and existing trading platforms following suit and axing commission,” begins Yoni Assia. “This is important to attract new investors; people who are often put off from investing because of the cost. It’s also a boon to existing Etoro customers trading cryptocurrencies on the platform. One in 10 of people who came to us to trade crypto in 2017 and 2018 subsequently went on to diversify into stocks trading. This all helps normalize the view of crypto assets.” He continues:

On the crypto side, for those who are more experienced traders, we launched eToroX, our regulated crypto exchange earlier this year, providing them with a secure platform to trade crypto and tokenized assets on the blockchain.

Acquisitions were a major trend for crypto exchanges this year, with Circle offloading Poloniex, before itself being acquired by Kraken. Binance took up a stake in derivatives exchange FTX, meanwhile, and Coinbase divested itself of Earn.com. Etoro was not exempted from this M&A flurry either, acquiring Firmo in March. The Danish business provides a platform that enables exchanges to execute smart financial contracts across various assets, including crypto derivatives, and across all major blockchains.

Then, explains Yoni Assia, “In November we acquired Delta, the crypto portfolio tracker app, which will help investors make better decisions around their crypto assets by providing tools such as portfolio tracking and pricing data.”

12 Million Users and Counting

In 2019, Etoro surpassed 12 million registered users in over 100 territories, including the U.S., which the social trading platform entered this year on a mandate to “make trading, investing and managing money easy for everyone,” according to Assia. Here, it finds itself going up against rivals such as millennial investor favorite Robinhood.

When asked about the greatest challenges Etoro encountered this year, Assia cites issues that will be familiar to all exchange operators: “the volatility of prices, and recently, questions around the security of assets on exchanges.” However, he claims that “a lot of people who joined us in 2017 at the peak of crypto’s popularity have stayed and this year have diversified into other areas such as stocks,” noting that “Crypto assets are often a gateway to investing for many people on the Etoro platform. We always say invest in the brands you love, so IPOs such as Uber have helped attract more investors.”

Multi-asset exchanges such as Etoro, which offer cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and commodities, are also duty bound to educate, given that many of their users have no previous experience of such instruments. “Not only are we providing them with a place to trade, we also ensure they have access to information to help them make informed decisions about their trading behavior,” acknowledges Assia.

“We provide regular analysis of price performance, changes and events in the sector, while reassuring them about the safety of Etoro as a regulated platform. Etoro is profitable and we use that profit to develop more services for our customers, broadening the offering to create a platform that people can use to manage and invest their money to suit their needs, with a wide range of assets to choose from, beyond cryptocurrencies.”

Crypto Taxation and Resolutions for 2020

This year, it was reported that tax agencies such as the IRS and HMRC have been contacting cryptocurrency exchanges to bulk request information on customer activity. When asked whether Etoro had fielded any such approaches, its CEO had this to say:



We have been required by tax agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate to provide information on our customers and as a responsible, regulated business, we have done this. We firmly believe that tax harmonization of crypto assets is a precursor to regulation, which is much needed to bring security to consumers and confidence to regulators. 2020 will be a coming of age for crypto assets.

It will also be a coming of age for Etoro if Yoni Assia’s predictions come to pass. According to the company’s founder and CEO, “Etoro is on track to launch a debit card, more details of which will follow in 2020.” He also asserts that “We believe the future of financial services lies in the tokenization of investable assets,” and tips Etoro to focus its energies here in the coming year.

Leaving my run-sheet behind, I sidled up to catch an impromptu performance from the man who once steered international standards in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

“I usually play Bach or Chopin,” Wilkins said, wrapping up his medley.

The next morning, more than 100 of the world’s most formidable figures in crypto compliance assembled to unpack one of the most pivotal regulatory developments in the history of our fledgling industry. Held June 28-29, 2019, in parallel to the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Osaka, Japan, the V20 Summit was a chance for the industry to respond to a highly controversial new set of recommendations handed down by the FATF.

Some saw it as an opportunity to legitimize crypto and bring virtual assets into the mainstream financial system; others feared an assault against our community’s most fundamental values of privacy and decentralization. CoinDesk’s Marc Hochstein told me via Twitter DM he thought it might be a bigger story than Facebook’s recently announced Libra. Another journalist suggested it might be crypto’s Bretton Woods moment.

Recommendation 16 was the one causing all the ruckus. As per the FATF’s new guidance, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) would be required to identify the sender and recipient on either side of a crypto transaction. Known as the “Travel Rule” due to the fact that data that must “travel” along with a traditional wire transfer, international banks and financial institutions had been forced to comply with these standards since the mid-1990s, giving law enforcement greater transparency and traceability to combat financial crime. And while the vast majority of major crypto exchanges already have Know Your Customer (KYC) policies in place for remitters, including beneficiaries opened up a Pandora’s Box of complexity. In any case, the FATF delivered their directives in Osaka, giving G20 member countries a tight 12 months to implement the guidelines, with a review set for June 2020.

Not-so-draconian

“It would have been nice for these FATF recommendations to be more accommodating to the sector but time constraints effectively ruled that out,” said Siân Jones, co-founder of xReg Consulting. “The major nations of the world got together to set that timetable and the FATF policy group had very little time to develop something more tailored to virtual assets.”

Jones, a self-described poacher-turned-gamekeeper-turned-poacher, has worked both sides of the regulatory fence and has watched the whole thing unfold over the past few years. She said the resulting guidelines were not as draconian as they might have been, were it not for the technical experts in that policy group – herself included – that were able to provide some balance.

During her technical overview on the implications of the FATF guidance, Jones congratulated VASPs at the V20 on being included in the global financial system. She said this might come with some benefits, such as making it easier for VASPs to get bank accounts, but it would also come with responsibilities. The critical piece now was to find the most appropriate strategies to help the industry develop and innovate in ways that still meet public-policy objectives to thwart money launderers and terrorists.

“This is a rapidly evolving landscape where regulators and industry just have to catch up with the new reality,” said Jones, who was also instrumental in enacting blockchain-friendly legislation in Gibraltar. Her presentation to the V20 opened with a warning slide:

Wake up! Smell the coffee!

“The V20 was a great effort to bring the world of crypto together in one room with FATF on the sidelines of the G20,” said Bénédicte Nolens, advisor to Circle, who said that even though crypto-assets have presented a great challenge to traditional finance, they have also opened up opportunities that will continue to evolve in the years ahead.

“We have to keep in mind that the goal of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulation is not to impose unnecessary process, but rather to demand process, so that the most nefarious activity in the world is starved for funding,” Nolens said. Examples of this could be slavery and the drug trade as well as terrorist activity.

A month prior, Nolens was at the FATF Private Sector Consultative Forum in Vienna, invited to present on Recommendation 16. There, she reiterated the importance of a globally-coordinated and consistent approach to implementing the new regulations in G20 member countries, to avoid a situation where firms might try to sidestep the new rules via regulatory arbitrage or through moving jurisdiction, known as “island hopping.”

She also explained how there was currently no crypto equivalent to the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) system, which is what banks use to achieve compliance with the Travel Rule, so VASPs would be forced to come up with something new. Further, Nolens observed that coordination would be tricky given the still very nascent, albeit global nature, of the crypto industry.

“It’s true the cryptocurrency sector isn’t very used to talking to regulators, and it can be very hard and very time consuming to build a constructive relationship between companies and their regulators,” said FATF Senior Policy Analyst Tom Neylan, who showed up alongside Wilkins, ready for a grilling from top VASP execs from Circle, Coinbase, Coincheck, bitFlyer, Kraken, BitMEX, Huobi, OKCoin, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Crypto.com, BITPoint, Liquid and more. “But it’s a critical step we have to go through if cryptocurrencies are going to become a real part of peoples’ daily lives.”

At the V20, Neylan told attendees that regulation can be a good thing for industry; it’s not something we should fear.

“The fear was that these new rules would force VASPs out of business,” said Ronald M. Tucker, convener of the V20 and founder of the Australian crypto exchange Bit Trade. “This risked driving the industry back underground and into dark markets, which, ironically, would make it even more difficult for law enforcers and regulators to do their job.”

Tucker was quick to realize the true gravity of the FATF intervention, as he dealt with a similarly existential threat back in 2014, when Australia was grappling with the issue of double taxation. The rules meant consumers were taxed at the time of buying crypto, and again later, when they used it to purchase items subject to local goods and services tax.

Many exchanges thought that the new rules wouldn’t apply to them.

To tackle the problem, the blockchain community needed clear direction and leadership, and at the time, there was no such vehicle. This moved Tucker to form the Australian Digital Currency Association (ADCA), with the goal of coordinating key stakeholders to develop a robust governance framework to organize all sectors. ADCA was to become a unified voice for the burgeoning industry, ensuring commercial operators were aligned, media were informed and government was educated.

Recently rebranded to Blockchain Australia, today the organization is recognized globally as a leader in regulatory engagement and best practice. And so, with the FATF rules pending implementation, and a lack of global coordination taking place, a sense of déjà vu gave Tucker the impetus to elevate ADCA’s proven formula to a global stage.

A community effort

It was just after CoinDesk’s Consensus 2019 in New York City when Tucker mobilized the core V20 organizing team – including myself, Anson Zeall of ACCESS Singapore, Philippe Le Saux of GMI Post, Nathan Smale of Emfarsis Consulting and the futurist Mark Pesce, well-known for his podcast, The Next Billion Seconds, who championed the role of Summit Chair.

We had less than seven weeks to pull the whole thing together and, at the beginning, our outreach efforts were met with some skepticism. For the VASPs that had actually heard about the FATF issue (most hadn’t, so that required a considerable education effort on our part), many thought the new rules wouldn’t apply to them. Or, they thought their time and money would be better spent lobbying against the FATF.

“We spent a lot of time rallying the community to stop petitioning against the Travel Rule and start collaborating toward a compliance solution of the industry’s own design,” said Teana Baker-Taylor, executive director of Global Digital Finance (GDF), an industry membership body that sets out standards and best practices for blockchain and digital assets.

GDF members knew the FATF’s hasty timeline and global coordination requirements posed a significant risk to the industry, especially given the additional operational and commercial costs of compliance. But it was also the perfect imperative to finally get the crypto compliance clique working together on a globally interoperable solution. As such, GDF was one of the first to lend its support to Blockchain Australia and ACCESS Singapore to help get the V20 off the ground.

“As a community, we talk about mainstreaming and mass-scale adoption, but it’s often inside our own echo chamber,” said Baker-Taylor, who was named Blockchain Leader of the Year at the 2019 Women in Tech Awards. “If we want the future to reflect our ideals, we’ve got to take some responsibility and step up to educate policymakers, as opposed to resisting them.”

When a trio of policymakers pledged their support to the V20 – namely ex-FATF President Wilkins, Japanese Congressman Naokazu Takemoto and Taiwanese Congressman Jason Hsu – we observed a ripple effect throughout the industry, with huge momentum building among the VASPs. Behind the scenes, we were working like mad to rejig the agenda for Day 2 to accommodate Hsu’s schedule. Hellbent on speaking at the V20, he’d have to fly straight to Osaka from Washington, D.C., where he’d been participating in the U.S. Department of State’s International Visitor Leadership Program and other key think-tanks discussing major industry developments, such as Libra.

“I felt I needed to be there to support industry and act as a bridge between them and the policymakers and regulators,” said Hsu, who was nicknamed “The Crypto Congressman” by Vitalik Buterin in 2018. Coming from a background in entrepreneurship, Hsu is a rare breed of politician, uninhibited by the usual glacier-pace of government innovation.

“If we want to go long on this industry, we need to regulate, but the current government are still scratching their heads on how best to do it,” said Hsu. He believes FATF will ultimately shed a positive light on the crypto industry, which still struggles to shake its associations with the darknet.

In the absence of clear guidance, Hsu said it’s critical for industry players to lay down the guardrails.

“This industry is prone to security infringement and the crypto operators have to look that truth square in the eyes,” said Hsu, with a nod to the hacks, data leaks and other security hazards making headlines every other day. “If we set the bar high and pave the way for the industry to be formalised, we will see less and less misunderstandings about the true qualities of crypto from the public as well as governments. The VASPs must bring their determination to the table to fix this.”

The site for the V20 Summit was apt. After all, Japan is home to the two biggest crypto exchange hacks in history: Mt Gox and Coincheck. These hefty security breaches ultimately led to Japan’s proactive stance on VASP regulation, becoming the only nation in the world to grant legislative status to its self-regulatory body, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA). The Financial Services Agency (FSA) was the regulatory body behind the establishment of JVCEA in October 2018. Both JVCEA and Japan’s Ministry of Finance were on the speaker lineup for the V20, together with representatives from public sectors including FSA and the Australian Government agency, AUSTRAC.

“The impact of hacking tends to be bigger than that of ordinary crypto-related money laundering transactions in terms of amount,” said Katsuya Toshihiko, who was the president of Coincheck when he attended the V20. The target of a major hack in January 2018, Coincheck had 500 million NEM tokens stolen by hackers, worth an eye-watering USD $530 million at the time. He says that “painful” experience is what triggered Coincheck’s deep sense of social responsibility and seriousness about responding appropriately to the FATF’s new guidance.

Yuzo Kano, representative director of the Japan Blockchain Association and co-founder of bitFlyer, an exchange, says it was Japan’s troubled history that motivated it to put its security protection and compliance standards under the microscope.

“Today, Japan is two to three years ahead of the rest of the world when it comes to self-regulation,” Kano said, demonstrating how painful circumstances can lead to innovation, provided we embrace the discomfort and look for growth opportunities. Kano spoke at the V20 about the contributions JBA has made, including its strong backing for the establishment of JVCEA as well as a Cryptoassets Governance Task Force aimed at developing safety standards for consumer protection.

Drawing insights from Japan’s story, V20 participants broke into groups to workshop a blueprint for the requirements of a technical solution that could satisfy the FATF (rather than prescribing any specific product, brand or service provider). A key outcome of these discussions was that the industry needed a governing body to represent its interests at an international level. As such, the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA) was established as a vehicle to continue proactive engagement with the FATF.

Since the V20, more organizations have joined the initiative, and now, IDAXA represents the national blockchain associations of Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Switzerland and JBA and JVCEA from Japan.

Work to do

To arrive at something that satisfies the FATF Recommendations while still being workable for business, a sustained industry-led effort is necessary to ensure the blockchain community’s ethos of decentralization is upheld and consumer privacy is protected above all.

The V20 was an early catalyst but the work is far from done. Most VASPs are still coming to grips with how to comply and how much it’s going to cost, especially all those smaller firms that are struggling to navigate a jumble of regulatory regimes and requirements with less staff and less resources. Meanwhile, a slew of exchanges have already delisted privacy coins such as monero and Zcash due to regulatory pressure.

Despite the near-term hurdles, it’s widely believed that the crypto sector’s strong tech focus can actually help achieve FATF’s goals to stymie financial fugitives. Further, industry frontrunners in the race to compliance believe that FATF compliance and data privacy needn’t be mutually exclusive.",2019-12-31 16:20:53+00:00,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/simplex-simplifies-fiat-crypto-payments-for-simex-users/,"Simex Digital Assets Exchange has announced a partnership with crypto payments provider Simplex to provide deposit services for its platform in fiat currency using credit and debit cards.

Simex slapped with SEC’s suspension notice

SIMEX Inc operates what it calls ‘a multifunctional platform’ that could perform as an investment bank and crypto exchange. The company has held a token sale, SIMEX STO, to expand its services to new jurisdictions.

The US regulators, however, suspended trading in the securities of its parent entity Simex Group Inc (formerly American Retail Group), after the Nevada-based firm made several false cryptocurrency-related claims. Among them were that they partnered with an SEC qualified custodian to offer regulated cryptocurrency transactions, as well as claims that their tokens are fully registered with the commission.

This wasn’t the first time a blockchain-related company got in trouble due to a foray into the cryptocurrency-inspired technology. Also last year, the SEC insisted on the name changes for the first Blockchain ETFs as investors seem ‎desperate for any kind of blockchain exposure, to the point where ‎many startups that put the word blockchain, or other cryptocurrency terms, ‎into their name have seen their share prices soar.",2019-12-31 13:36:13+00:00
