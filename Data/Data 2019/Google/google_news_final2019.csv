To entice traders to the platform, for the next three months, the exchange is offering a variety of promotional benefits, including “negative 0.3 percent trading fees,” in which traders can earn money back on all transactions. Traders who pre-registered get 25 percent off future transaction fees.

A competitive market

Danish Chaudhry, managing director of the exchange, told Decrypt that Bitcoin.com, which has been working on the project for a year, is hoping to compete against the bigger, more established exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance by catering to its base. “Bitcoin.com is one of the most trusted brands in the industry,” he said.

The current incarnation of the site was launched by Roger Ver in June, 2015, to provide accessible information about the Bitcoin platform. Ver subsequently led a controversial fork of bitcoin to bitcoin cash, which the site is known for advocating, as well.

Early signs are promising

Bitcoin.com is reportedly headquartered in St. Kitts and Nevis, in the West Indies. The new exchange will cover several base trading pairs consisting of bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH) and the stable currency Tether (USDT). Other coins listed upon the launch are Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), EOS (EOS), Tron (TRX), Stellar (XLM), Dash and Zcash (ZEC). Chaudhry said more coins will be added over time.

“We’ve had a great reception from the community already with over 11,000 pre-registers,” he said. “Crypto is all about accessibility to the financial system. We’ve been on a mission to make crypto usable for all.”

What's next

Chaudhry said the negative 0.3 percent fee process will encourage newcomers to “get paid to trade. The negative-fee promotion is valid on up to $1 million worth of cumulative trades per account.” (If you happen to be a whale, the promotion is also valid on up to $1 billion worth of cumulative trades on the Bitcoin.com exchange. The promotional period will last until December 2, 2019.

He said the exchange is also offering high-end security features, including cold-storage options, institutional-grade encryption and two-factor authentication.

Bitcoin.com has slowly been expanding its services beyond being a news and information site. It launched a mobile wallet for bitcoin and bitcoin cash in August, 2017, which the company claims has been downloaded more than 2 million times. And in June, it launched a peer-to-peer, bitcoin cash trading platform.",2019-09-02 06:00:29,https://cointelegraph.com/news/should-crypto-stay-decentralized-or-are-cbdcs-better-experts-answer,"There are several countries around the world that are developing national blockchain-based digital currencies — such as Venezuela and its state-owned Petro (PTR), China and its plans to issue a government-backed digital currency, etc.

We reached out to experts in the crypto and blockchain industries, central bank officials and researchers to answer whether or not we need a blockchain-based national digital currency if decentralized cryptocurrencies already exist.

Related: Central Bank-Issued Digital Currencies: Why Governments May (or May Not) Need Them

At the beginning of 2019, the Bank for International Settlements conducted a survey, revealing that 70% of central banks worldwide are examining the potential of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Related: CBDCs of the World: The Benefits and Drawbacks of National Cryptos, According to Different Jurisdictions

Later, a European Central Bank official highlighted the benefits of CBDCs and the International Monetary Fund published a report saying that central banks might issue digital currencies in the near future.

Why do we need CBDC if there are cryptocurrencies already?

Alex Tapscott, co-founder of the Blockchain Research Institute The question is not whether we need digital fiat currencies or not, but rather whether governments will fight to keep control over their monetary sovereignty and take steps to safeguard those powers. The answer is unequivocally, yes. Within 10 years, I expect that every major fiat currency in the world will be a digital currency on a blockchain. There are challenges to governments coming from multiple different directions. Bitcoin is the most obvious one — an alternative store of value and medium of exchange that exists outside of government censorship. But increasingly, large companies like Facebook — and soon, I'd guess, Amazon and others — are looking to launch their own payment systems and native digital currencies. The United States will surely do it in order to maintain global reserve status, and China will surely do it to extend social control over its population and extend its influence along the new Silk Road, in Africa and elsewhere its trying to influence. The currency wars are only just beginning. It will be a wild ride. Buckle up.

Morten Bech, head of secretariat, Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Bank for International Settlements No matter the question, decentralized cryptocurrencies — as we know them — are unlikely to be the answer. Decentralized cryptocurrencies make sense if you have something to hide. But that does not apply in most cases. What people need is (digital) money that they can trust in an increasingly digitized and global world. The technology is not settled. Neither Sweden nor Uruguay chose blockchain as the basis for their digital currency pilot programs. Innovation built on tried-and-trusted technology is making domestic payments increasingly convenient, instantaneous and available 24/7. Private and public experimentation with new ideas for fixing cross-border payments is finally gaining momentum. Not every idea is a good one. But payments are rightly in focus and the best ideas need room to take off.

Larry D. Wall, executive director, Center for Financial Innovation and Stability Governments currently supply digital currencies but typically only to banks. Banks then supply digital currency to the rest of the economy. Some governments (central banks) may someday offer digital currency directly to nonbank entities, but the amount offered on blockchains is likely to be relatively small. Blockchains are an inefficient database solution in systems that rely on a trusted third party (see Meunier’s review of blockchain decision models). Nevertheless, some governments may issue some digital currency on a blockchain to facilitate on-chain transactions. Decentralized cryptocurrencies are not a substitute for a government currency. Decentralized currencies do not satisfy some of the reasons why governments issue currency, such as retaining control over monetary policy, earning seigniorage and retaining the ability to have a lender of last resort. Moreover, decentralized cryptocurrencies need to overcome a variety of hurdles before they could challenge government-issued currency. No decentralized cryptocurrency meets all of the minimum requirements including widespread acceptance, having a relatively stable value, being safe and convenient to use, and having the ability to handle large throughput. Additionally, issues such as governance mechanisms, and vulnerability of consensus mechanisms must be resolved before permissionless blockchains could become essential parts of the financial system.

Robby Houben, professor, University of Antwerp Alexander Snyers, researcher, University of Antwerp, co-authors of “Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain,” Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies, European Parliament Blockchain-based digital currencies issued by central banks are nothing like decentralized cryptocurrencies. Where the latter are ultimately intended to function as a single global currency independent of any authority, the former are more or less the technological equivalent of physical banknotes controlled by a central authority. The value of national cryptocurrencies is likely to be controlled by the respective central banks. So, the big question is whether they really bring something to the table that cannot already be achieved within the existing monetary market and infrastructures. A number of central banks have played with the idea of issuing a blockchain-based digital currency, but have come to the preliminary conclusion that, for now, the issuance of such digital currency is not the way to go.

Aleksi Grym, head of digitalization, Bank of Finland Assuming blockchain means an open, permissionless, peer-to-peer network, the answer is simple: There is neither a need for a state-issued version of one nor would it make much sense. The whole idea of a cryptocurrency network is that no one in particular controls it. If a state would retain control over the network, it would not serve the purpose that decentralized cryptocurrencies do. On the other hand, none of the countries that are developing state- or central bank-issued digital currencies will be using blockchain technology, as far as I’m aware. Those projects have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies. Instead, they are about finding solutions to the challenges arising from a cashless society — and about financial inclusion. Venezuela is a special case because it’s going through a profound social and economic crisis. So, it doesn’t make sense to compare it to other countries in this context.

Will White, senior consultant at 11:FS National governments will try and may succeed in using some of the best practices developed in the cryptocurrency space to upgrade what we currently understand as government-backed money. That's interesting in the short term, but by definition, what they develop will be centralized, to some extent. The whole point of a truly decentralized cryptocurrency, is exactly that: They are decentralized. There is no central state or quasi-state entity controlling the currency. You trust the math and code, not state actors. What humans have defined as money has changed many times over the centuries, even if the fundamental uses have not — a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. The fundamental principles that underpin decentralized cryptocurrencies are an upgrade to the existing centralized approach. Mass adoption of decentralized cryptocurrencies is a ways off, but once they reach a tipping point, it seems unlikely that people would choose the inferior option. History teaches us that humans always adopt the upgrade. But let's see, maybe they will prove me wrong",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/philippine-boxing-champion-manny-pacquiao-releases-own-cryptocurrency,"Philippine boxing champion and celebrity Manny Pacquiao has launched his own cryptocurrency.

The world economy is a complex system that has undergone many different phases in the past century. As strange as it may sound today, there have been times when banking crises were rare, pay was rising alongside productivity, and the U.S. dollar would buy a certain amount of pure gold. Despite its obvious successes in certain areas, the global monetary system that laid the foundations for this time of stable growth eventually failed, and here’s why.

When $35 Bought You an Ounce of Gold

The post-World War II era started with a negotiated monetary system that set the rules for international commercial and financial relations. This was a product of the Bretton Woods agreement from 1944, which created a new financial order in a world devastated by its largest military conflict yet.

The conference in New Hampshire, held before the war was over, established the main pillars of global finance and trade: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), now part of the World Bank Group. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), later replaced by the World Trade Organization (WTO), was signed soon after.

The governments behind the Bretton Woods system, many of them wartime allies against Nazi Germany, aimed to create a world in which a major armed conflict and a global depression could never happen again. That was to be achieved by building an effective international monetary system and reducing barriers to free trade. Over 700 representatives of 44 countries hammered the agreement in the course of a month. No bankers were invited to take part, by the way.

The delegates decided that their monetary construct should rest on the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. In an effort to replicate the pre-war gold standard, although in a limited form, the dollar was tied to the precious metal at a fixed price. The United States government committed to convert dollars into gold at $35 an ounce. The U.S. currency became the new gold standard, while retaining flexibility in comparison with real gold.

A system of fixed exchange rates was then introduced, in which all other major currencies were pegged to the gold-backed U.S. dollar. Participating nations had to maintain currency prices within 1% of parity through interventions in their foreign exchange markets. Purchases and sales of foreign currency were constantly made to keep rates close to the target.

The Good, the Bad, the Ugly

The Bretton Woods system was effectively a monetary union with the dollar being its main currency. For some time it generated the stability the post-war world needed to recover and rebuild. Virtually no major country experienced a banking crisis during the period the agreement was respected, between 1945 and 1971.

Speculative financial flows were seriously curtailed and investment capital was channeled into industrial and technological development instead. Helping national economies grow, creating jobs and lowering trade barriers were to give peace a better chance. And to a large extent they did, aside from cold war proxy conflicts.

In 1971 the US President Kills The Gold Standard

Several notable achievements resulted from the Bretton Woods arrangement in a variety of domains. An online portal called WTF Happened In 1971?, the year when President Nixon’s administration unilaterally terminated the U.S. dollar’s convertibility to gold, summarizes most of them, backed with astonishing numbers. For example, up until Washington’s decision to end the dollar-gold standard, productivity rose steeply and wages, unlike nowadays, didn’t fall behind.

In other words, the rising value of goods and services translated into rising pay for workers. The 119% increase in productivity from 1947 to 1979, the last year when these indicators were moving together, was closely followed by a 100% positive change in the average hourly compensation. Since then, until 2009, productivity has grown by a whopping 80%, while compensation scored only an 8% increase, the quoted data shows.

Similar trends can be observed with many other pairs of indicators. Divergence between real GDP per capita and average real wage in the U.S. has been growing steadily since the 70s, according to the calculations of the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The consumer price index skyrocketed after the untying of the dollar from gold. The same applies to the median sales price of new homes sold in the country. And against this backdrop, divorce prevalence and incarceration rates in the U.S. increased markedly.

The post-war semi-gold standard mitigated income inequality in the United States, which had been rising in the years following the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 and jumped again after the U.S. government decided to turn the dollar into purely fiat money. Since 1971, the top 1% of earners have seen their income grow significantly, while that of the bottom 90% has remained almost unchanged for decades. The curves crossed somewhere in the beginning of the century and in the years after the 2008 global financial crisis the rich have been getting richer, while the poor have been getting poorer again.

Other negative trends after the abolition of the last gold standard include the ballooning U.S. national debt, from well below a trillion dollars in the 70s to over $20 trillion in 2018. As of June 2019, federal debt held by the public amounted to $16.17 trillion. Last year it was approximately 76% of GDP and the Congressional Budget Office expects it to reach over 150% by 2040. At the same time, the United States’ goods trade balance has dropped dramatically, reaching a record low of almost -$80 billion at the end of December.

Will the Next Reserve Currency Be Crypto?

Bretton Woods, despite its positives, had some significant flaws that eventually led to its demise. Unlike the gold it was backed by, the dollar, which was the system’s reserve currency, could be manipulated by the powers in Washington in accordance with America’s own interests, and it was. Dollars were supposed to provide liquidity to the world economy but initially the United States wasn’t printing enough of them. As a result, its partners experienced shortages of convertible currency. And in the later years the opposite occurred, the greenback was too inflated by the U.S. It quickly became evident that the agreement is tailored to the interests of the United States, which at the time of its signing owned two thirds of the global gold reserves.

In essence, the monetary union gave too much power to the U.S. and was only going to work as long as other countries were willing to accept the status quo. With Washington exporting inflation to the rest of the world, however, its partners started to convert large amounts of dollars into gold while the U.S. was ratcheting up the political pressure on them to accept and keep its printed money at fixed rates against their national currencies. Eventually, countries like France decided that enough is enough and started selling their dollars for gold. The U.S. then broke the link between its currency and the precious metal, which, along with the return of floating exchange rates, effectively put an end to Bretton Woods and the gold standard.

A similar situation currently exists in Europe’s own monetary union. Critics say much of its problems stem from its very design, which heavily favors the interests of Germany, the continent’s economic locomotive and one of the world’s largest exporters. The government in Berlin is a supporter of low inflation which ensures German high tech industrial exports continue to bring high revenues. However, in the Eurozone’s southern flank countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Greece need higher inflation to remain competitive as exporters.

It is becoming evident that a reserve currency beyond the control of various governments would be an improvement over fiat money subordinate to the national interests of one superpower or another. A cryptocurrency that serves as a means of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and which cannot be inflated or deflated through biased political decisions could be an instrument that would facilitate global commercial and financial transactions without favoring a side. Besides, participating parties would own the real asset itself and not some derivative.

Satoshi Nakamoto must have thought about these matters when designing Bitcoin. The person, or persons, behind this name listed a symbolic date as their birthday on Satoshi’s P2P Foundation profile – April 5, 1975. Be it intentional or serendipitous, that’s a date which evokes the historical development of relations between people, government and money.

On April 5, 1933, through Executive Order 6102, the U.S. government forbid its citizens from “hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates.” The aim was to artificially increase demand for its fiat currency at the expense of demand for gold. During the Bretton Woods era, only foreigners, and not U.S. citizens, were allowed to convert dollars into gold, which is arguably one of the system’s flaws. The order was reversed in 1975, making gold possession in the United States legal again.

Swiss crypto banks receive licenses from a financial regulator

Two Swiss crypto-specializing organizations, Seba Crypto AG and Sygnum, received banking and securities dealer licenses from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the banks announced in separate statements on Aug. 26.

With the new license, Seba expects to officially launch its new trading platform early in October 2019, the company stated. Its plans include the establishment of a digital asset platform for professional traders, firms and institutional clients, as well as custody storage and asset management.

Sygnum said that regulatory approval will allow it to bring its digital asset offerings to the market, which include custody and integrated liquidity platform for major digital currencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and digital Swiss Franc tokens.

German Cabinet and Bundesbank are in close communication on CBDC issues

The Cabinet of Germany and central bank Deutsche Bundesbank are working together closely on issues related to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

On Aug. 29, Germany’s federal parliament published official feedback to a request from the Free Democratic Party, which asked the Cabinet to respond to six questions related to CBDCs in July 2019.

In the document, dated Aug. 16, the Cabinet answered all of these questions, citing major reports and surveys in the space, including a January report by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). Specifically, when asked about its knowledge or insights about CBDC, the Cabinet cited the BIS, claiming that 70% of global central banks are engaged in CBDC work, but only two have concrete plans to issue digital central bank money.

The Cabinet emphasized that Sweden is the only country in the European Union that is currently considering issuing CBDCs. However, a final decision about CBDC issuance has not been reached, the authority stated. In addition, there are some concrete CBDC plans in Uruguay, but shakey pilots have led to uncertainty regarding future implementation, the Cabinet wrote.

Swiss Federal Council publishes an opinion on Facebook’s Libra

The Swiss Federal Council expressed its official opinion on Facebook's upcoming Libra crypto project. This and five other specific questions were brought up by the Social Democratic Party national councilor Prisca Birrer-Heimo.

Among other things, the politician wanted to know which legal obligations the Swiss-based Libra Association has to fulfill, which additional measures are envisaged, and whether the Federal Council sees Facebook's Libra as a reputation risk for Switzerland.

In regard to legal obligations, the Federal Council stated in its reply that these are currently still unclear due to some missing details. It notes that competent authorities such as FINMA would decide ""as soon as an application is made or activity is carried out.""

For Libra, as with other cryptocurrency-related activities, the Bank Act, the Financial Market Infrastructure Act and the Anti-Money Laundering Act lay down general rules that may require banking and payment system licenses from the FINMA.

President of Bundesbank: Facebook Libra does not make central banks redundant

President of German Bundesbank Jens Weidmann sees no danger to the central banks’ independence in Facebook’s Libra. ""At least as far as the Eurozone is concerned, I am relaxed,"" said the economist in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Aug. 25.

At the same time, he noted that one has to be aware of the risks of such digital currencies since there could be a credit risk as well as an exchange rate risk if money is not exclusively linked to the local currency of its user.

""For Libra, the key question for me as a central banker is what impact such a private digital means of payment would have on monetary policy, financial stability, and payments, if it were widespread.""

While he admits that information concerning the projects is limited, he said that what differentiates them is that Venus's purpose is not financial inclusion, but to replace credit cards, while Libra’s purpose is broader.

He concludes that Libra is a currency that can be used widely for global online payments, international remittances between individuals, games and more. Venus, on the other hand, would be linked to the legal currency of the country where Binance operates, and can be used for online payments in local areas, local interpersonal transfers, store payments and other purposes.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/big-four-and-blockchain-are-auditing-giants-adopting-yet,"Last week, Big Four firm Deloitte unveiled a mobile platform designed to host blockchain networks on a small scale for demonstration purposes. The product is “based on client interest in understanding blockchain capabilities in live interactions,"" as per the press release.

With this move, the Big Four companies — comprised of Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young (EY) and KPMG — continue their expansion into the field of blockchain. Combined, the firms brought in over $148 billion in revenue last year, as they handle over 50% of audits for both public and private companies. Consequently, their presence in the crypto space could be a reflection of the state of blockchain adoption.

So, how far have the Big Four gone while exploring distributed ledger technology (DLT), and can blockchain offer any particular perks for those companies?

Big Four: Consistent, but limited interest in blockchain

At this point, all of the Big Four companies have at least demonstrated some interest in blockchain, albeit their approaches tend to differ. Some companies, like Deloitte, have been mostly researching how this technology has affected the general market, while EY, for instance, has focused on releasing software solutions tailored for the needs of cryptocurrency businesses.

Such diversity can be explained by the very nature of those companies — being professional services networks, they offer a variety of services, including audit, tax, consulting, enterprise risk and financial advisory. It is also the reason why the Big Four have yet to fully dive into blockchain instead of merely flirting with the technology, as Cal Evans — the founder of Gresham International, a compliance and strategy firm — opined in a conversation with Cointelegraph:

“Because the Big Four work in such a wide scope of sectors, they are unable (or unwilling) to dedicate serious time to blockchain. This makes sense, given that they cannot invest in every new technology set which comes along (although we view blockchain as different). One key thing to note is that many of the big four only got into blockchain when Crypto projects began using them to show more transparency. The Big Four are known to only get involved with something when their client base is using it, blockchain was and is no exception.”

“These appear to be just early steps,” Juan M. Villaverde, chief crypto analyst at Weiss Ratings, said. “They [the Big Four] have begun to recognize the potential of DLT, but they have not yet figured out how to leverage that potential.”

According to recruitment platform Indeed, as of March 2019, PwC had 40 blockchain-related job offerings, being the top recruiter in the field among the Big Four. EY came second with 17 vacancies, followed by Deloitte with 10 job offers.

Meanwhile, a more up-to-date search shows that PwC is still the most active professional services network when it comes to blockchain technology, but has only 13 positions directly mentioning the word “blockchain” left. EY has four job offerings, while apparently neither KPMG nor Deloitte are hunting for any blockchain talent at this point. That seems to confirm that the Big Four’s interest in the crypto space is existent, but moderate: PwC, for instance, has a total of 1,010 open vacancies on Indeed, meaning that its 40 blockchain-related job offers account for a minuscule fraction of that number.

Maurizio Raffone, CEO at crypto-focused consultancy and advisory firm Finetiq Ltd., told Cointelegraph:

“My impression is that the Big Four are keen on blockchain as an additional area where they can provide consulting services rather than audit services. There has been a trend by audit firms to move into more lucrative consulting and blockchain offers them yet another opportunity for that strategy.”

Nevertheless, blockchain itself should also prove especially useful in the auditing market due to its transparent nature, as Evans told Cointelegraph:

“Blockchain is one of the few technology sets that can actually aid in most auditing respects. Financial auditing can be assisted by an end-to-end blockchain-based company as all transactions will be open and verifiable. They will also be contained within one ledger, which is one of the largest problems for an independent financial audit. Of course, there is more than one type of audit. Blockchain can be deployed across different sectors to make, for example, a service level agreement audit more effective. Companies could be monitored using blockchain to ensure that they are meeting compliance and the clients wishes.”

Raffone agrees that auditing practices could benefit from having blockchain in place. “I see blockchain as a cost-saving technology in the auditing space,” he told Cointelegraph. “Given the public nature of financial accounts, a blockchain solution would be rather efficient.”

However, Villaverde of Weiss Ratings is wary that the Big Four can stimulate crypto adoption only in certain scenarios. If the Big Four seek to involve themselves exclusively in the support of private blockchain solutions, the expert said, then it would hardly have any effect on the market at large, because “a private, permissioned blockchain is little more than a glorified database.” He went on, saying:

“It’s only when these firms decide to leverage the power of public blockchains, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, that we envision these initiatives having a significant impact on public adoption.”

Having started accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment for a part of its services back in 2017, PwC today is arguably the Big Four company that is the most proactive in exploring cryptocurrencies and blockchain. The company even has a major training program in place to boost its employees’ knowledge on the field.

Thus, PwC is no stranger to the crypto space and its major problems: In its 2018 study entitled “Blockchain is here. What’s your next move?” the firm highlighted regulatory uncertainty and trust as major barriers to blockchain adoption among businesses. Additionally, PwC has paid particular interest to stablecoins — another increasingly important part of the industry — and struck a partnership with decentralized lending platform Cred to advise on issuance of a United States dollar-pegged cryptocurrency.

However, the firm has not limited its blockchain presence to its advisory department. In March 2018, it partnered with leading global asset management company Northern Trust in a bid to enable real-time equity audits via blockchain and hence make the underlying transactions more transparent. Two months later, PwC invested in VeChain, a large cryptocurrency startup specializing in web services, supply chain management and anti-counterfeiting. In July of the same year, news broke that PwC was going to audit Tezos, the ambitious cryptocurrency project that was going through an internal dispute and several class-action lawsuits at the time. As per the accompanying press release published by the latter, it was allegedly the first time a “large-scale blockchain organization” had been accepted as a Big Four audit client.

Most recently, PwC announced the release of a cryptocurrency auditing software solution. Specifically, the company updated its Halo auditing suite to accommodate “entities engaging in cryptocurrency transactions” by providing independent evidence of private-public key pairing and collecting information about transactions and balances from blockchains.

EY has released more solo crypto-related software projects than any of its Big Four rivals. First, in April 2018, EY announced Blockchain Analyzer, becoming the first mainstream auditor to offer its services specifically for the needs of cryptocurrency companies, which allowed for the gathering of an organization’s entire transaction data from multiple blockchain ledgers. A year later, the firm followed up with a major update, introducing “the second generation” of EY Blockchain Analyzer. According to Paul Brody, the global innovation leader for blockchain at EY, the new version can be used for multiple purposes — such as audit, tax and transaction monitoring.

Moreover, in March 2019, EY unveiled another software solution — this time, for tax purposes exclusively. Dubbed Crypto-Asset Accounting and Tax, or CAAT, the tool was designed to assist its U.S. customers — both public and institutional — in filing IRS tax returns related to crypto assets.

Further, in May, EY open-sourced the code of Nightfall — its solution that enables the transfer of ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain “with complete privacy” — and put it on GitHub. “It is an experimental solution and still being actively developed,” the company warned.

Finally, the audit titan has applied blockchain to track wine. Specifically, the platform — titled Tattoo — helps consumers across Asia determine the quality, provenance and authenticity of imported European wines. As with the aforementioned Nightall, EY's solution enables its customers to perform secure and private transactions on the Ethereum public network by using zero-knowledge proof technology.

On top of releasing a number of blockchain-related software solutions, EY has also been supplying its regular services to crypto actors. Namely, the firm has been appointed by QuadrigaCX — a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange that went defunct under mysterious circumstances — as an independent third party to monitor the proceedings in a creditor protection case. However, some of the exchange’s former clients are not happy with how EY has been handling the case: At some point, the auditor reportedly transferred 103 Bitcoins (approximately $1 million) to the exchange’s locked-out cold wallets. According to the report released by EY in February, the loss was caused by “a platform setting error.”

KPMG

Blockchain-based software solutions: Yes

First-hand adoption (Bitcoin acceptance, crypto ATMs): No

Investments in the crypto market: No

KPMG has not only been increasing its presence in the blockchain space, but has also been a member of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance (WSBA) since 2017.

Over the past 12 months, it has partnered with blockchain company Guardtime to offer blockchain-based services to clients; joined forces with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to integrate blockchain in the pharmaceutical supply chain (the initiative will reportedly speed up the process of tracking inventory and boost the accuracy of data shared between members of the supply chain); and worked with United Arab Emirates officials to successfully test a blockchain-based Know Your Customer, or KYC, application.

Additionally, KPMG collaborated with three powerful software companies — Microsoft, R3 and Tomia — to develop a blockchain-powered solution for telecom settlements. Arun Ghosh, who leads KPMG's blockchain consultancy, said of the initiative:

""Blockchain has the potential to deliver transparency and visibility, providing the opportunity to help reduce reconciliations and increase efficiencies associated with traditional interconnect billing, roaming and partner settlement processes.”

Apart from working on blockchain-backed projects, KPMG has also studied the cryptocurrency market with an overall bullish outlook. In a November 2018 report, for instance, the auditing company invited institutional investors to “realize its potential.” which, in turn, would allegedly benefit the industry at large. “Cryptoassets have potential. But for them to realize this potential, institutionalization is needed,” the document’s authors argued.

KPMG’s latest survey on blockchain, however, suggests that most tax and finance executives are not considering adopting the technology. Regardless, David Jarczyk, innovation principal and tax leader for blockchain at KPMG, highlighted its potential benefits for the financial world:

“Blockchain is like a spreadsheet on steroids that can automate certain tasks, build greater transparency, speed and reliability, and provide a single source of transactional information.”

Deloitte

Crypto/Blockchain market reports: Yes

Blockchain-based software solutions: Yes

First-hand adoption (Bitcoin acceptance, crypto ATMs): Yes

Investments in the crypto market: No

Deloitte was the earliest Big Four player to delve into the crypto space, as it announced its first blockchain lab in Dublin back in May 2016. By that time, the company had already collaborated with the Bank of Ireland to complete a joint proof-of-concept blockchain trial. Today, three of the Ireland’s four largest banks are reportedly using Deloitte’s blockchain solution (developed in its Dublin branch) to verify employees’ credentials.

Also in 2016, Deloitte installed a Bitcoin ATM on the premises of its Toronto office. Placed outside the security gates so it could be accessible to the general public, the machine showcased the firm’s interest in cryptocurrencies.

Since then, Deloitte has kept a close eye on the market, releasing several reports that have recognized regulatory uncertainty and Bitcoin’s infamous scalability problem among the main hurdles for mass adoption. Nevertheless, the company’s August 2018 report entitled “Breaking Blockchain Open: 2018 Global Blockchain Survey” predicted that blockchain technology was getting closer to a breakout moment. Meanwhile, the newest issue of that report unveiled that as much as 73% of Chinese enterprises believe that blockchain is a top-five strategic priority, highlighting the nation’s focus on the technology.

This summer, Deloitte has also begun supporting a new blockchain accelerator program called Startup Studio in partnership with 22 other companies, including Fidelity and Amazon. Startup Studio will reportedly host workshops for blockchain startups to help them enhance a variety of skills important for the industry.

Finally, the Big Four giant has just rolled out its own blockchain-based platform designed to provide users with blockchain demonstrations and experiments. Called Blockchain in a Box, the new product is described as “a mobile, self-contained technology platform capable of hosting blockchain-based solutions across four small-form-factor compute nodes and three video displays, as well as networking components that enable integration with external services, such as traditional cloud technologies.”

Are the Big Four doing enough?

As for now, experts seem somewhat skeptical of the Big Four’s progress in terms of blockchain, arguing that their knowledge on the subject seems limited at this point. Evans told Cointelegraph:

“There have been examples in the market where companies such as PwC have actually plagiarized and copied work from other companies within the crypto space, showing that their knowledge on the subject is incredibly limited. It is hard for a company to push something they don't fully understand themselves.”

Either way, most accounting and auditing functions have the potential to become automated with smart contracts at some point in the future, and the Big Four would have to drastically increase their presence to stay relevant, according to Weiss Ratings’ Villaverde, who continued:

“The main question is: Will the Big Four lead in the creation of this new technology? Or will smaller, potentially more nimble, players jump into the space and take over significant market share from the Big Four?”

Whether or not the Big Four will adopt blockchain in their regular service offerings, the fact that all four firms draw up regular reports on the crypto and/or blockchain market shows that they are interested and are closely following the developments in the industry.",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/09/151096-wasabi-wallet-user-arrested-for-handling-bitcoins-from-serious-crime/,"In a Reddit post titled, “Warning about using Wasabi: it can ruin your life,” a poster called “u/green105” has alleged that his or her partner was arrested and jailed “for days” for innocently handling Bitcoins traced to a serious crime.

Wasabi is a Bitcoin wallet that uses a type of scrambling called “Chaumian CoinJoin” to obscure or “de-link” the chain of custody of a Bitcoin.

The company bills itself as a pro-privacy service and encourages more participants to use the wallet (there are fees involved):

“(A)nonymity loves company…(T)he more participants there are, the better your privacy is, and the faster the CoinJoin rounds are. Whether you are looking for state of the art operational security or you are philosophically aligned with the principles of freedom and privacy, now it is YOUR time to contribute.”

But if the Reddit post is true, an allegedly innocent Bitcoin user has mixed his Bitcoins with those of a serious criminal, and has thereby been implicated.

Here is the story, courtesy of Reddit:

“My life has been seriously affected by Wasabi.” “My partner has used Bitcoins for years and never had any problems. He never did anything illegal. But apparently people told him Wasabi was good to use to improve privacy, so he always used that.” “He recently spent some BTC online that went through wasabi.” “Soon after that online purchase, police turned up at our house and took us into custody, saying they had proof we were directly linked to a serious crime. They said they could trace the Bitcoin transaction.” “It has been days and he is still in custody. He told me to write here.” “He has been trying to explain what wasabi is and tried to give records of his Bitcoins transactions but apparently it isn’t clear since he didn’t keep a full record of everything. Especially because one of the exchanges doesn’t exist anymore. It all sounds so suspicious that he was mixing coins with strangers and helping them hide their illegal funds.” “We had an expensive holiday that we saved up for for years. We have lost thousands of dollars now because we couldn’t go on the holiday and now I have to figure out what to do.” “My lawyer is advising me so I might not answer questions, I don’t know.” “I just want people to realise there is a risk to mixing your coins with other random people. My partner says he had no idea this could even happen.”

A user called “iLoveStableCoins” seemed to respond on behalf of Wasabi, claiming that, “In many of these countries, a non-custodial wallet like Wasabi is simply a piece of software that is not considered an exchange or Money Service Business, thus is protected…please speak to your lawyer in your jurisdiction to better understand how the software is treated.”

This would not be the case, however, in many American states, where crypto transacting services are being increasingly brought under money transmitting rules.

“iLoveStableCoins” speculated that the incident came about as a result of “incompetence” at a blockchain forensics company, and likened bitcoins to cash:

“It looks like a forensics company has flagged Bitcoin from some illegal or criminal activity. That Bitcoin later became part of a CoinJoin, and thus has dispersed across many coins that equally share the small probability of the criminal history. This is much the same way that if you touch a $20 bill, it likely was part of criminal activity of one sort or another…The Forensics company is likely incompetent, and may even be given too much credibility and has, likely, flagged all of the coins that participated in the transaction.”

“iLoveStableCoins” post suggests suggest some users may be using Wasabi without realizing the service is illegal in their jurisdiction.

Many Reddit responders refused to believe “u/green105’s” allegations, and the poster does not appear to have returned with an update.

The “cryptocoin community” was shocked earlier this year when police in the Netherlands and Luxembourg seized six servers hosting Bestmixer.io, “one of the three largest mixing services for cryptocurrencies.”

Like Wasabi, Bestmixer was a service designed to obscure the chain of custody of bitcoins.

Though Bestmixer reportedly “guaranteed” customer anonymity, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service said it gathered detailed intelligence about users for almost the entire history of the service, and will be furnishing that data to other law enforcement for analysis:",2019-09-15 00:00:00,,,

Helping to fix it poses a huge opportunity for the cryptographers behind cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Now they have one of the stewards of that system in their corner: Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England Governor.

A week ago in Jackson Hole, Mont., Carney told the Federal Reserve’s annual gabfest that central bankers could develop a network of national digital currencies to create a new, basket-managed “synthetic hegemonic currency.”

Carney’s proposal was mostly a thought exercise to inspire conversation around solutions to the dangerous imbalances fostered by the current system’s dependence on the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. The specifics were necessarily thin – any solution will be both technically and politically complicated, and even though he’ll depart the BOE in January, Carney’s status as a public official demands caution.

But I don’t share those constraints. So, let me lay out my own modest proposal for a cryptocurrency-based fix to a broken global financial system. Hint: it is not “buy bitcoin.”

I’m neither a trained economist nor a cryptographer, so I know this act of hubris will attract naysayers. I welcome criticisms and suggestions. I’m also quite certain I’m not the first to think of this, so I’m eager to hear of others working on similar projects.

The thing is I’ve been obsessed with both the structural failings of the global financial system and cryptocurrency for many years now. Three of my five books have covered those topics. It’s hard to bite my tongue.

Fixing the global currency system

I think that instead of creating a whole new global currency, central bankers should work to develop digital currency interoperability. We need a system of decentralized exchange through which businesses in different countries can use smart contracts to create automated escrow agreements and protect themselves against exchange rate volatility. With algorithms that achieve atomic swaps now available and with other advances in cross-chain interoperability, I believe we’ll soon have the technology to remove foreign exchange risk from international trade without relying on an intermediating currency such as the dollar.

Here’s how it might work: A hypothetical importer in Russia could strike a deal with an exporter from China and agree to a future payment, denominated in Chinese renminbi, based on the latter’s prevailing exchange rate with the Russian ruble. Relying on an interoperability protocol that’s commonly integrated into each party’s preferred digital national currency – either in privately run stablecoins or central bank-issued digital currencies – the two firms could then establish a smart contract that “trustlessly” locks up the required renminbi payment in decentralized escrow. If delivery and contract fulfillment are confirmed, the payment is released to the Chinese exporter. If not, the funds revert to the Russian importer at the same, initial conversion rate.

In this scenario, both parties are protected against adverse exchange rate movements. Yet, despite the trust gap between them, there is no need to intermediate the payment through dollars, and no need for either party to take out a forward contract, FX option or some other expensive exchange rate hedge.

Of course, the importer would suffer the opportunity cost of locking up otherwise valuable working capital for a few months. But private banks could mitigate that with collateralized short-term loans on terms that would be a lot cheaper than the current cost of currency hedging. Alternatively, if the smart contract is executed on a proof-of-stake blockchain, the locked-up funds could be employed to earn cryptocurrency staking rewards.

What would central banks’ roles be?

Well, for one, they could backstop the entire credit and/or staking model. Providing liquidity or guarantees to banks’ trade finance businesses would be a more constructive use of domestic money supply than applying it to rainy-day funds of U.S. Treasuries and other dollar assets.

Secondly, they’d be charged with assuring the trustworthiness of the interoperability protocol. Whether central banks would endorse and regulate privately developed protocols such as Tendermint’s Cosmos, Parity Technologies’ Polkadot or Ripple’s Interledger, or whether they would commission a multilateral body to build and manage a single official system, there’s no getting around an oversight role for public sector policymakers.

(Don’t worry, crypto libertarians, no one’s taking away your bitcoin in this scenario. In fact, since central bankers will retain their own monetary sovereignty, with exchange rates continuing to fluctuate, bitcoin’s appeal as a “digital gold” alternative to domestic currencies could well be enhanced.)

A broken system

Let’s be clear: if foreign trade no longer requires dollar intermediation, the U.S.-centric global economy will suffer a massive impact, perhaps bigger even than the 1971 “Nixon Shock,” when the dollar was unpegged from gold.

The entire reserve currency system, in which foreign central banks own U.S. government bonds as a backstop and multinational companies hold large parts of their balance sheets in dollars, is based on the need to protect against exchange rate losses. If that risk is removed, the edifice would, in theory, come down.

Yet, as Carney rightly points out, continuing with dollar hegemony is not tenable, either. The system is broken. Whenever global investors get the jitters they rushen masse into “safe haven” dollar assets – even when, as with President Trump’s trade war with China, U.S. policy is the cause of their malaise.

This process, which has become progressively more acute with each financial crisis, causes huge distortions, economic dysfunction and political turmoil. And with economies slowing and the worldwide value of bonds carrying negative yields now at $17 trillion, we now face worrying signs of another crisis. This time, traditional central bank policy could be powerless.

When another crisis comes, the dollar-based system will generate a predictable vicious cycle. The dollar will rapidly rise. This will hurt U.S. exporters, which further stir the mercantile instincts of anti-free traders such as Trump and fuel risks of a destructive tit-for-tat currency war.

Meanwhile, emerging markets will suffer capital flight as a rising dollar raises the risk of debt defaults in those countries. Their central banks will respond by jacking up interest rates to prop up their domestic currencies, but this will choke their economies at a time when they require easier, not tighter, monetary policy. Unemployment will surge and governments will topple.

The current system breeds what former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke dubbed the “global savings glut” as developing countries squirrel money into dollar reserves that could otherwise be used for domestic development.

In the U.S., it creates the countervailing effect of massive deficits – in other words, sky-high debt. Far from being the “exorbitant privilege” once described by French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the dollar’s reserve status is an American curse. It creates artificially low U.S. interest rates, which misprices credit risks and fuels bubbles – see: the 2008 housing crisis.

Worst of all, the dollar system undermines democracy and diminishes economic sovereignty. The performance of every economy hinges on U.S. Federal Reserve policies. Yet the Fed’s low inflation/maximum employment mandate is defined only by the U.S. economic outlook. This policy mismatch makes it much harder for governments to pursue effective measures to create opportunities for all.

When things really go sour, the Fed belatedly and reluctantly becomes the world’s lender of last resort, pumping dollars into the world’s banks via their New York subsidiaries. That’s how we ended up with the “quantitative easing” surfeit after the last crisis, money that went into financial assets, London real estate and fine art, but did little to boost the earning power of the middle class.

These policy failures have bred a populist backlash against globalization, manifest in the U.K.’s Brexit crisis and President Trump’s adversarial trade policies. Yet the reality is that capital flows are more globalized than ever and increasingly beating to the drum of the U.S. dollar.

So, yes, we need change. The question is how and in what time frame?

Violent or managed change?

The solution I described could be adopted abruptly and disruptively or it could be cooperatively managed for a smoother transition.

Under the first scenario, let’s consider Russia and China, the two countries I deliberately chose for my explanatory example, since they are believed to be further ahead than most in developing fiat digital currencies. Both would love to do away with dollar dependence. Could they go it alone and jointly devise a bilateral, cross-chain smart contract between a digital renminbi and a digital ruble? Sure. Would other countries follow suit? Maybe. Such an uncontrolled retreat from dollars could do huge harm to the U.S. and the overall global economy.

That’s why I think central banks should heed Carney’s call and work together on a solution. They could coordinate the gradual introduction of digital currencies, selectively managing access and applying differential interest rates to discourage an exodus from shaky banks. They could also charge the IMF with seeking a global standard for cross-chain interoperability.

Regardless, the disruptive technologies behind digital currencies, stablecoins and decentralized exchanges will advance. It’s a ticking time bomb.

Some central bankers, led by Carney – and now, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who said in a Wharton Business School podcast that stablecoins are “inevitable” – get it. Others need to learn fast.

Reuters reported on Sunday that a statement from the National Coordination Committee of the DPRK for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism accused the U.S. and “other hostile forces” of “spreading ill-hearted rumors.”

“Such a fabrication by the hostile forces is nothing but a sort of a nasty game aimed at tarnishing the image of our Republic and finding justification for sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK,” the agency said via a spokesperson. The news was first reported by North Korea’s state-run news agency, KCNA.

The U.N. report – reportedly researched by “independent experts” and presented to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee at the end of July – said that North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” hacks to collect roughly $2 billion, which is laundered over the web.

The experts are reportedly investigating “at least 35 reported instances of DPRK actors attacking financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and mining activity designed to earn foreign currency” – activities that span around 17 nations. Many of North Korea’s hackers are said to operate under the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency that handles clandestine operations.

Attacking crypto exchanges allows North Korea “to generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector,” the U.N. report said.

The notorious hacking group Lazarus has been claimed to be working for the state and linked to major crypto exchange breaches, as well as attacks in the banking world, including a $81 million hack of the Bangladesh central bank three years ago.

Argentina puts $10K limit on dollar access

Argentina has shown an affinity for Bitcoin (BTC) in recent times, with trade volumes accelerating as uncertainty around the economy grew. Last month, a premium appeared on the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges.

Now, access to hard currency is restricted to just $10,000 for individuals looking to dump ARS on the market, despite its exchange rate falling 34% in USD terms since Aug. 2.

Demand for Bitcoin, a cross-border asset which is impossible to control, should therefore increase further, some suspect.

“Buy Bitcoin,” cryptocurrency-focused attorney Preston Byrne tweeted following the news.

Volume data showed Argentinians trading more in ARS on P2P crypto exchange Localbitcoins last week, a trend which may continue if circumstances follow those of embattled Venezuela.

Draper may force Bitcoin switch

Argentina’s economic woes may not match those of Venezuela, yet Bitcoin advocates appeared to preempt the crisis months beforehand.

As Cointelegraph reported, billionaire investor Tim Draper even met with the country’s president earlier this year to bet on Bitcoin outperforming ARS.

Should Draper win, he demanded Argentina shun the peso altogether, adopting Bitcoin as its new official state currency.

“That would be a perfect decision, as there's a lack of confidence in this coin,” he reportedly commented at the time of the meeting in March.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-payments-startup-eligma-raises-e4-million-from-bitcoin-com-and-pangea-blockchain-fund/,"Crypto Payments Startup Eligma Raises €4 Million From Bitcoin.com and Pangea Blockchain Fund

Many retail stores would like to welcome the added business that the crypto community brings, but find that they don’t have the capability to do so within their existing payment infrastructure. One company bridging this gap is Slovenian startup Eligma which is now set to start global expansion with an infusion of cash from Bitcoin.com and Pangea Blockchain Fund.

Eligma Raises €4 Million For Global Expansion

Eligma has announced it’s recently completed a new funding round, bringing the total investment to €4 million ($4.39M) with participation from Bitcoin.com and Pangea Blockchain Fund. The company is the developer of Elipay, an infrastructure for accepting crypto payments at brick-and-mortar as well as online shops where merchants can receive settlement in local fiat currency.

Since starting out with a public crowdsale in 2018, Eligma has established more than 450 locations in Slovenia, Croatia and Turkey accepting crypto on a daily basis. The new injection of capital will help the company expand its services to additional markets around the world where merchants wish to add support for crypto payments at the point-of-sale.

“On a daily basis, we are being contacted by merchants and companies from various countries where cryptocurrencies already represent an important alternative to the local currency or fiat in general. This is not only an important recognition of all our hard work and persistence, but is also proof of the practical utility of our ideas and solutions. We are proud to have raised the interest of Bitcoin.com and Pangea Blockchain Fund, whose investment clearly reflects their belief that our solutions have global market potential,” stated Eligma CEO Dejan Roljic.

Pangea Blockchain Fund is an investment firm focusing on offering intellectual and financial capital to early stage blockchain companies. It invests in entrepreneurs committed to building blockchain solutions that disrupt or transform the status quo. The firm secured $22 million in a seed round in February 2019 from a group of investors including Copernicus Asset Management SA, a Switzerland-based financial services group, and Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver.

Empowering Merchants to Accept Cryptocurrencies

Elipay helps businesses accept cryptocurrencies as payment in a way that they are familiar with, without being exposed to the volatility of the crypto markets or to the regulatory and tax uncertainty that currently exists when receiving crypto in many countries. The service is already used by hotels, shops, restaurants, sports facilities and a range of service providers, including for flight tickets, taxi rides and car rentals. It is also notably accepted by 14 supermarkets from one of Slovenia’s biggest grocery store chains Tus, with more than 20,000 products on offer.

On the buyer side, the shopping process is designed to be extremely simple. The user just scans the purchase QR code with a crypto wallet, selects the cryptocurrency and confirms the transaction. Currently, the supported locations can serve more than 20,000 users of the Elipay app as well as the 4 million users of the Bitcoin.com Wallet. The company also plans to open up its infrastructure for additional crypto wallets soon.

The Elipay service offered by Eligma is available for Android and iOS mobile devices. It supports cryptocurrencies like ETH, BCH, BTC, and the company’s native token, ELI. Users of the Elipay app receive up to 2% of ELI tokens back for every purchase, and can spend these on further shopping at any of the Elipay locations. According to a recent blog post by the CEO of Eligma, following the new investment, the ELI token will be integrated into the Bitcoin.com Wallet and will be listed on the new Bitcoin.com Exchange. The token will also shift from the Ethereum blockchain to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

“The development of finance is going towards cash becoming a thing of the past. Among other things, this is because doing business with it is quite time-consuming and expensive. On the other hand, one of the main problems with cryptocurrencies is that the confirmation of transactions can take several minutes if not more, which is unacceptable in daily shopping. Eligma effectively solved this problem with Elipay, which enables instant crypto transactions; furthermore, the merchant receives settlement in local fiat and is thus safe from crypto volatility. This makes the use of cryptocurrencies quick and effective for daily use. We must not forget that cryptocurrencies were envisioned as the electronic cash of the future,“ commented Roljic.

The Slovenian Success Story

Beyond empowering local businesses in their home market to accept cryptocurrency payments, Eligma has greatly helped put Slovenia on the map for many crypto entrepreneurs and developers. The country is now a global leader in the number of brick-and-mortar shops and service providers accepting fiat and crypto. In fact, with a population of just 2 million people, Slovenia now contains more retail locations accepting bitcoin cash payments than the United States. A recent short documentary on Bitcoin.com’s Youtube channel highlighted the thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem in Slovenia.

Elipay has also enabled the creation of Bitcoin City, a giant shopping mall with over 500 shops where many accept crypto payments in the Slovenian capital of Ljubljana. This commercial center is frequented by 21 million visitors a year and features the world’s highest concentration of shops accepting crypto in one location. Eligma revealed it now plans to expand this concept to additional cities around the world.

At last, bulls are finally showing that they’re not gone. Bitcoin, in the past 24 hours, has jumped by 2%, rallying to $9,800 after remaining around the support of $9,500 for a number of days.

While this isn’t much, this bounce has purportedly stopped the cryptocurrency from stooping below a key uptrend, setting the stage for more upside.

According to Raoul Pal, the former head of the Goldman Sachs hedge fund sales division in Europe, Bitcoin is actually looking like a “rocket ship” that is getting ready to take off. He suggested in a recent tweet that the Bitcoin chart is clearly in a “wedge pattern” that has a “high probability of success” in breaking to the upside.

If you don't have any bitcoin $BTC #bitcoin then this looks like the last time to board the rocket ship…



I LOVE wedge patterns like this. They have a high probability of success.



Good luck. There is a ""shit ton"" going on in macro land. pic.twitter.com/tmNzxkcgTQ — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) September 1, 2019

The macroeconomic backdrop is supportive of this.

In a Twitter thread published prior to this optimistic Bitcoin tweet, the current Real Vision chief executive, charted a potential yield collapse to -4% for the two-year U.S. Treasury, which would be a total paradigm shift in finance. With rates going negative in Europe and Japan, this isn’t out of question.

The Commodity Index is also on the verge of breaking through a key support level, which may coincide with a deflationary breakdown that is being reflected in interest rates.

Also, banks in vulnerable regions — namely Japan and Europe — are also purportedly teetering on the “cliff of death”, as the Bitcoin bull likes to call it.

And who could forget foreign currencies, which may soon collapse against the U.S. dollar?

While Pal wrote that these charts might be just a coincidence, the reality is that a recession may be brewing. This, he says, should be cause for investors to purchase bonds, dollars, diamonds, and, of course, Bitcoin.

Some aren’t so optimistic, however, Mike Novogratz, for instance, is expecting for the cryptocurrency to begin a slow grind to fresh highs, not an all-out spike that will catch short sellers with their pants down. As reported by Ethereum World News previously, the current chief executive of Galaxy Digital recently explained that institutions are finally starting to enter into the cryptocurrency game, and will thus drive up the price of Bitcoin. Like many others in the industry, he believes that this class of investors will bring in monumental levels of capital to this space, outpacing any retail investors that came before them.

But what will institutions bring the Bitcoin price to? You might be asking.

Well, in previous interviews, he has suggested $20,000. As detailed by this outlet on an earlier date, he stated that institutions will be the catalyst that will bring Bitcoin to $20,000, potentially by year’s end. Crazy, right? He stated back in late-July:

“I’m not selling the next time we hit $14,000. The second time we reach that level, [there may be] a move to $20,000. I don’t expect this to happen in the next few weeks: I don’t expect it to the middle or the end of the fourth quarter. But the next wave will come when the institutions — the state of X, Texas Teachers Union, and those guys — come in, and then you will see Bitcoin hit $20,000 and higher.”

The price of bitcoin has recovered pretty well from lows hit late last year. But investor enthusiasm for all things crypto and blockchain remains far below peaks scaled several quarters ago.

Subscribe to the Crunchbase Daily

So far in 2019, the pace of private funding for blockchain and crypto deals lags sharply behind last year. The downward trajectory applies to both initial coin offerings and venture rounds for companies in the space.

Altogether, investors have put an estimated $3.38 billion to work in initial coin offerings and private funding rounds for companies in 2019, according to Crunchbase data.* At this pace, annual investment portends to be a fraction of the 2018 investment total of $12.86 billion.

The declines come as major cryptocurrencies continue to trade well below prior peaks, although they have rebounded from last year’s lows. And new cryptocurrencies have failed to deliver breakout hits. Out of the roughly $250 billion in total valuation for the crypto space, roughly 70 percent comes from bitcoin alone.

Below, we break out numbers for both investor-backed rounds and ICOs, looking at trendlines for investment totals and round counts.

Not A Popped Balloon, But Certainly A Deflated One

The current crypto and blockchain funding environment looks less like a popped bubble than a deflated one. Currencies are still trading and startups are getting funded. There’s just less money chasing the space.

In the chart below, we look at total funding across both initial coin offerings and private funding rounds for crypto and blockchain-focused companies globally:

Cryptocurrencies hit their bubbliest highs around late 2017 and early 2018. That’s when bitcoin passed the $20,000 mark, and total crypto market cap peaked at around $700 billion. Venture funding of blockchain-related startups was also on a roll around then, buoyed by bullish memes about the technology’s game-changing potential.

This past December, by contrast, looks like the lowest point for the crypto space in the past couple years, with total market cap down to about $75 billion. Crypto bears, some of whom predicted an eventual bitcoin valuation of zero, were starting to look rather prescient.

Now here we are in early September, and neither the bull nor the extreme bear case appear to be winning out.

VCs Still Like Blockchain, But They Like It Less

In short, blockchain is still a thing. It’s just not the thing that everyone’s talking about.

That includes venture capitalists, many of whom have been outspoken boosters of all things blockchain. As a group, they’ve been putting less money into the space of late.

So far this year, investors have put about $2 billion into rounds for companies tied to crypto and blockchain technology, not including ICOs. That’s on pace to come in well below the $4.65 billion tally for all of 2018. We have more numbers in the chart below:

Some of the most prominent VCs active in the blockchain and crypto space have been cutting back in 2019. For instance, Andreessen Horowitz participated in 14 funding rounds with an aggregate value of nearly $850 million in 2018, per Crunchbase data. So far this year, the firm has backed five deals valued at a little over $75 million.

They’re not alone. Digital Currency Group and Blockchain Capital, two of the most active investors, have also cut back sharply in deal count and aggregate value of rounds they’ve backed.

It also should be noted that the numbers include companies for which crypto or blockchain is a component but not a core focus of the business. For example, the largest crypto-related round for 2019 is a $323 million Series E for Robinhood, which offers cryptocurrencies but is best-known as a commission free stock trading app.

But there have been other big rounds this year for companies more exclusively focused on crypto.That includes a $200 million Series A for Bithumb, a South Korean crypto exchange platform, and $100 million in Series C funding for Kraken, the San Francisco-based crypto trading provider.

Little Punditry For Blockchain And Crypto Slowdown

So, the data speaks pretty clearly: Blockchain and crypto-related funding is down but by no means dead after the cryptocurrency bubble popped. What’s lacking, however, is much in the way of punditry regarding why things are playing out this way.

The blockchain and crypto camps, as aforementioned, are mostly populated with extreme bulls and extreme bears. There are those who think bitcoin is the younger generation’s version of gold. And there are those who consider crypto the mother of all scams and blockchain the most over-hyped technology ever.

One possibility, laid out by Andreessen Horowitz, is that blockchain will present disappointments in its long march to widespread viability. The firm writes:

“Blockchain computers are new types of computers where the unique capability is trust between users, developers, and the platform itself… In exchange for these new capabilities, blockchain computers trade off other capabilities such as transaction scalability. This can lead people to dismiss them, in the same way people dismissed early smartphones because they traded off computing power and screen size for portability and new sensors.”

Personally, I’m not buying the firm’s comparison here. No one really dissed the future of smartphones, even back in the flip phone era. We just weren’t sure exactly when all the pieces – price, portability, durability, computing power, etc. – would come together in a package that warranted mass adoption.

Blockchain, by contrast, has some pretty hardcore doubters. And cryptocurrency, in particular, has some real pessimists among the world’s wealthiest, including Warren Buffet, who compares bitcoin to rat poison squared.

That said, we’re still in early innings. And for now, it looks like neither the blockchain boosters nor the detractors have sealed a winning case.

According to data from major monitoring resource CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin now accounts for 70.5% of the total cryptocurrency market cap as of Sept. 3.

Bitcoin market cap hits pre-$20K high

That figure has not been seen since March 2017, and comes as BTC/USD makes gains at altcoins’ expense.

As Cointelegraph reported, continued underperformance in cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin has triggered warnings from traders and analysts alike.

Among them are Peter Brandt and RT host Max Keiser, the latter again claiming this week that altcoins would never recover from this downturn.

“Alts never coming back… Sorry,” he tweeted on Sept. 3, also referencing market cap statistics. Brandt reiterated similar warnings.

“When will altcoin junkies understand that $BTC is the crypto with real and lasting value,” wrote Brandt, who added:

“Altcoins are to Bitcoin what lead is to Gold.”

Some sources had reported Bitcoin hitting the 70% mark as early as last week.

Market cap readings set highs across the board

Bitcoin itself delivered a sudden return to form late on Monday, having previously dropped to just $9,350. At press time Tuesday, BTC/USD was circling $10,360, bringing 24-hour gains to 6.2%.

Altcoins in the top twenty, however, mostly failed to achieve more than 4%, meaning they, in fact, lost value in Bitcoin terms.

Some commentators voiced caution about placing faith in Bitcoin’s strength. Market cap, they argued, is a poor measure of performance, as it includes many altcoins which do not even have any trading volume.

Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on the phenomenon of Realized Market Cap, a metric designed to solve those inconsistencies which has also set new records in recent weeks.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-bitcoin-price-drop-below-10000-was-a-bear-trap/,"Last week, Bitcoin price fell below $10,000 yet again, and with the break of support, much of the market turned bearish and began calling for lows around $8,000 to be tested. However, before the long Labor Day weekend concluded, Bitcoin price was back well above $10,000, and is already closing in on $11,000 not even 24 hours later.

The fast movement back up without any resistance has left traders scratching their heads, but one crypto analyst explains that the move was nothing but a bull trap, and bears are now trapped in shorts below support that never quite turned resistance.

Bitcoin Price Action: Bears Trapped in Latest Move Below Support at $10,000

There are many different types of Bitcoin trading strategies. Swing traders tend to sell high and buy low, with few trades in between. Breakout traders wait for a chart pattern or support or resistance to fail before taking a position. It’s the latter that was targeted in this latest bear trap, according to one crypto analyst.

Last week after repeatedly tested support at $10,000 failed once again, Bitcoin price fell sharply to the mid-$9,000 range where it chopped for roughly 72 hours before it turned right back around and is now at a price even higher than when the breakdown first began.

However, that support never flipped into resistance, so on the way back up it posed little challenge for Bitcoin to get through. Bearish breakout traders who entered shorts after the support failed are now trapped below that support in short positions that are either already closed at a loss, stopped out, or open and the trader is sweating it out while the position is underwater.

The analyst also says that high timeframe “directional bias” favors further upside movement, especially if $10,460 was broken above. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin price is trading at over $10,600, which means that if the analyst is correct, Bitcoin price will continue to trend higher and higher from here.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and businesses in the industry have had to put up with regulatory uncertainty for quite some time. The strong desire to tap into their incomes and profits goes hand in hand with failure on behalf of authorities and regulators to fully understand the nature of decentralized digital assets. Not to mention how absurd the reluctance to legalize something they want to tax anyway. Cases in Portugal show that it’s hard to positively know what exactly traders, investors and companies owe the state. Luckily, the narrow scope of the local tax legislation means they have to pay less than in other countries.

Crypto Exchange Exempt From VAT, Trading Gains Spared From Tax

A report by the Portuguese business daily Jornal de Negócios, quoted recently by crypto outlets whose interpretation was then copied by mainstream media, released some details about the Portuguese tax system that turn the country into sort of a crypto tax haven, at least until powers in Brussels make up their mind about bitcoin taxation or Lisbon amends its tax code. According to the newspaper, the Portuguese Tax and Customs Authority, which had already determined that crypto trading income is not subject to taxation, has recently stated that cryptocurrency exchange and payments are exempt from VAT.

The latest clarification has been issued by Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (the Portuguese Tributary and Customs Authority) in response to a request from a Portuguese company planning to establish a crypto mining operation. The owners wanted to acquaint themselves with the legal provisions that govern the accounting procedures and tax obligations related to the activity. In its filing, the entity explains the process of minting digital coins and notes, and that there are two aspects that concern taxation – the miner’s reward in cryptocurrency and the exchange of that yield into fiat money. In its reply, the tax authority quotes local regulations and European law to conclude that the transactions related to mining, both the remuneration and the exchange, should be exempted from VAT.

An earlier statement by the agency addresses another aspect of crypto taxation. The document was issued almost three years ago in response to a request for guidance on how tax rules apply in relation to revenue received from the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies. In its explanation, the regulator notes that cryptocurrencies can generate different types of taxable income. These include gains from buying and selling digital coins, commissions charged for the provision of services related to acquisition or use, and gains derived from the sale of products or services for cryptocurrency.

Portuguese tax agents elaborate that income generated by trading can fall in three different categories – capital gains (G), capital income (E) and corporate or professional income (B). Category G covers the sale of securities, financial derivatives, certificates whose holders can receive value from an underlying asset, and some other instruments. However, as legislators have chosen to adopt a closed definition, tax can be levied only on the items mentioned in the law, and cryptocurrencies are not in the list. Digital coins do not fall in category E, either, which pertains only to income generated from capital investments.

If applicable, category B prevails over the other two. Income in this category is taxed based on the exercise of an activity and not according to its source. Portugal’s tax code states that if this is an activity oriented toward profit making, the taxpayer is obliged to issue invoices whenever they sell a product or provide a service. The tax agency then draws the conclusion that the sale of cryptocurrency is not taxable under the current tax legislation unless it constitutes a taxpayer’s professional or business activity, in which case it will be taxed in category B.

The current state of the tax treatment of crypto trading conducted by private individuals was confirmed by a representative of the professional services network Deloitte. “Portugal does not tax the increase of value of any currency nor the gain on the sale of any currency. Obviously, any currency losses may not be offset against any gains either,” explained Luis Leon, tax partner at Deloitte Portugal. Noting that the matter has already been analyzed by the country’s tax authority, which issued a ruling with this position, Leon told news.Bitcoin.com:

Cryptocurrencies are no different from a Portuguese tax perspective. Accordingly, the appreciation of cryptocurrencies or any gains on the direct sale of cryptocurrencies are not taxed in Portugal.

In that context, Portugal is a positive example in Europe, where many other countries tax profits from crypto trading–either by imposing capital gains tax or as part of the income tax base in general. Other exceptions in the region include Slovenia, where capital gains of individual investors trading cryptocurrencies are not reported and taxed, and Belarus, which last year introduced tax breaks for crypto incomes and revenue from mining, issuing, and trading coins for a period of five years. Malta and Germany do not tax long-held crypto assets. And in Switzerland, cryptocurrency gains of individual traders are treated as tax-exempt capital gains, but an annual wealth tax is levied on the total amount of coins you hold as part of your net worth.

Which Taxes Apply to Cryptocurrencies

To better understand how taxation affects crypto incomes and profits, one needs to have a basic idea of the differences between the main types of applicable taxes. In most cases, both natural persons and corporate entities are obliged to pay a number of direct and indirect taxes. A direct tax such as the personal income tax is imposed upon a person or their property, while an indirect tax like VAT is levied on transactions.

Crypto incomes can fall under multiple categories depending on the legal status of the taxpayer and the nature of the transaction. In countries where the Value Added Tax system is implemented, the majority of the world’s jurisdictions, VAT is typically charged on the final value of a product or service sold to an end user. Currencies are neither products nor services, so by default no VAT should be imposed over their purchases or sales in exchange operations.

There’s an ongoing debate about the nature of decentralized digital coins. In some countries, different regulators have varying opinions on how to treat cryptocurrencies. In the U.S., for example, the Treasury referred to bitcoin as a convertible decentralized virtual currency in 2013. Two years later, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) classified it as a commodity. At the same time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes cryptos as property. Then, last year, bitcoin was mentioned in a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in light of the need of a “broader understanding” of what money is nowadays.

In Europe, at least for the moment, the treatment of cryptocurrencies for regulatory and tax purposes has largely been determined by a decision of the European Court of Justice. In October 2015, ECJ stated that bitcoin represents a means of payment and its exchange should therefore be exempted from VAT. According to the ruling in the Skatteverket v Hedqvist Case C-264/14, the exchange of bitcoin falls within the exemption in Article 135(1)(e) of EU’s VAT Directive, which covers transactions concerning currency, bank notes, and coins used as legal tender.

David Hedqvist is a Swedish national who planned to launch a crypto exchange platform that would profit from the margin between bid and ask prices. He sought clarity regarding the VAT treatment of this kind of revenue and received an opinion from the Swedish Revenue Law Commission (Skatterättsnämnden) stating that the services he intended to provide would be exempt from VAT under Article 135. However, the Swedish Tax Administration (Skatteverket) disagreed and appealed the matter to the country’s Supreme Administrative Court, which in turn referred the case to the ECJ.

The other category of taxes that can be applied to crypto-related income includes direct taxes. One of the most common of them, the corporate tax, is generally imposed on the income or capital of business entities, and companies working in the crypto industry are no exception. In most cases the tax is levied on a corporation’s net profits, but governments may also tax shareholders if they are paid dividends.

Investments in cryptocurrencies can be subject to capital gains tax. These gains are usually realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals like gold, antiques, real estate, and property. In some jurisdictions, crypto assets are part of that list as well. The capital gains tax, where it’s imposed, can come in different rates for individuals and corporations. Certain countries may charge only professional traders.

Germany is another interesting example in Europe. The Bundesrepublik does not tax long-term investments in cryptocurrency. If a private trader sells their bitcoin more than a year after its purchase, the profit is exempt from capital gains tax. The same applies to annual profits of less than €600. That means keeping digital coins in Germany will actually save you money. And regardless of how much profit you make when you sell the cryptocurrency after hodling for over a year, you don’t owe the state any tax on your gains.

Significance for Traders

Portugal’s decision not to tax direct gains on the appreciation or sale of cryptocurrency and ECJ’s ruling that VAT is not applicable to exchange transactions have considerable significance for traders. And it’s not only because crypto users are spared some taxes. Both actually tip the scales in favor of Bitcoin’s currency status in times when lawmakers and regulators are trying to wrap their heads around a phenomenon born as a result of financial evolution. With many analysts now pointing towards the next big crisis on the horizon, the importance of cryptocurrencies is likely to grow further, with more investors, traders, and ordinary users attracted to the space.

Based in London, Elliptic sells blockchain analytics tools to some of the world's largest cryptocurrency platforms — including Binance and Circle — as well as banks. The company's software is used to investigate criminal activity on bitcoin's digital ledger and monitor transactions to prevent money laundering.

The company recently learned that the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, used a donation website that generated a different bitcoin wallet address for each person that visited. That made it harder to track the funds and see where they were sent. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the EU.

""Because we are always on top of what's about to happen, we can see when those funds start to move to exchanges,"" Elliptic's co-founder and CEO James Smith told CNBC in a phone interview. ""We were able to let our customers know that these funds were heading towards them, and they were able to stop them.""

The firm on Wednesday said it raised $23 million in a funding round led by Japan's SBI Holdings to fuel an aggressive expansion into Asia. SBI, a financial services business spun off from SoftBank, has made headlines in the past due to partnerships with blockchain companies like Ripple and R3. Elliptic also counts Spanish bank Santander as an investor.

Terrorist funding is just one area of illicit activity the firm's platform deals with. It's also used to track people trading child pornography and drugs, as well as hacks that result in funds being stolen. Elliptic shows a different side of the crypto industry, in that its technology is seen as more favorable to financial services businesses and regulators.",2019-09-03,https://www.coindesk.com/binance-acquires-crypto-exchange-jex-to-boost-derivatives-offerings,"Binance has announced the acquisition of crypto exchange JEX in a bid to boost its crypto derivatives offerings for pro traders.

Seychelles-registered JEX offers spot and derivatives (including options and futures) trading in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether.

Going forward under Binance management, the derivatives exchange will be known as Binance JEX. JEX offers its own token, also called JEX, which will continue to be guided by its existing foundation, Binance said.

Binance plans to first distribute the tokens to users through “marketing activities and community incentives” before ultimately clawing back and burning them via means including trading commissions, according to the announcement.

Binance did not disclose the terms of the acquisition deal.

“JEX has a seasoned developer team with proven experience in cryptoasset product development. JEX has developed solid derivatives product offerings including perpetual contracts and options, which are aligned with Binance’s product roadmaps in the cryptoasset derivatives market,” said Binance co-founder Yi He.

Just yesterday, Binance announced that it had made two testnets for its planned futures platform available for user testing, with competitions to encourage user participation before a live launch.

Bitcoin’s price recovery from the Aug. 29 low of $9,320 is backed by an uptick in the dominance rate to 30-month highs.

Weak trading volumes, however, indicate the recovery could be short-lived and a fall back to $9,750 could be in the offing in the next day or two. Weekly chart indicators continue to call a bearish move.

A high-volume UTC close above the bearish lower high of $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) is needed to revive the short-term bullish outlook.

A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed for full bull revival.

Bitcoin (BTC) is flashing green at press time, while its share of the cryptocurrency market has reached at 30-month highs above 70 percent.

As of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $10,350 on Bitstamp – up 6 percent on a 24-hour basis – after hitting an eight-day high of $10,506 earlier today. At that level, BTC was up 12.7 percent from the one-month low of $9,320 hit on Aug. 29.

Over the last nine weeks, BTC has consistently found takers in the range of $9,000–$10,000. The resulting recovery rallies, however, ended up creating lower highs – a sign of bull market exhaustion – as seen in the chart below.

The question now is whether the latest recovery from sub-$10,000 levels will invalidate the bearish lower-highs setup with a move above $10,956.

The gains seen in the last four days look sustainable and could be extended further, as BTC’s dominance rate – the cryptocurrency’s share of the total crypto market – has jumped to 70.10 percent, the highest level since March 2017, according to CoinMarketCap.

The gauge stood at 69 percent on Aug. 29, when BTC’s price slipped to one-month lows below $9,400.

Many observers consider price gains sustainable if they are backed by a rise in the dominance rate, as discussed last month. The shift indicates money is being poured into BTC for the long haul and not to fund purchases of alternative cryptocurrencies.

Trading volumes, however, tell another story, and suggest the recovery seen in the last four days could be short-lived.

Hourly and daily charts

The green bars (buying volumes) seen in the last four days on the hourly chart (above left) are smaller compared to the red bars (selling volumes) seen during bitcoin’s drop to one-month lows on Aug.29.

Buying volumes only ticked up slightly in the 60 minutes to 21:00 UTC yesterday. During that time frame, BTC rose from $10,200 to $10,470. Further, Sunday’s green bar (above right) is significantly smaller than those observed during previous breakouts above $10,000 (marked by arrows).

Put simply, the price bounce seen in the last four days lacks substance and a pullback, possibly to $9,750. could be in the offing in the next day or two.

The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish if prices print a UTC close above $10,956 on high buying volumes. That would open the doors to $12,000.

Weekly chart

The bitcoin bulls have failed four times in the last 10 weeks to secure a weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000. Meanwhile, the sellers have failed persistently failed to keep prices below $9,500.

A downside break looks likely, as key indicators have turned bearish, including a bearish crossover of 5- and 10-week moving averages.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has also dropped below zero for the first time since February, while the Chaikin money flow, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, has slipped to a 4.5-month low of 0.10, a sign of weakening bullish pressures.

The second-largest fantasy sports provider Fanduel has revealed customers can make deposits on the platform using cryptocurrency. Fanduel members can now top up their accounts with BCH or BTC via the digital currency payment provider Bitpay.

Fanduel Adds Bitcoin Payments via Bitpay

Fantasy sports is a hugely popular phenomenon worldwide that experiences more than 10% annual growth and is currently an $8 billion dollar industry. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) has recorded more than 59 million fantasy sports participants throughout the U.S. and Canada alone. Basically, the game of roto or fantasy sports is a tournament of people who assemble virtual teams made up of real players in a professional league. The players’ real-world statistics apply to the fantasy team and people wager on these games every day online. Fanduel is one of the most popular fantasy sport providers on the internet, and on Sep. 3, the company announced that customers can fund their accounts with bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC).

Fanduel members can use crypto with their accounts via the Atlanta-based payment processor Bitpay. The firm’s chief commercial officer Sonny Singh explained that with Fanduel accepting bitcoin, patrons will have access to an alternative form of payment just before the NFL season starts. “NFL Football is one of the most popular sporting events to watch and the start of the football season makes it a perfect time to introduce Bitcoin to these fans,” said Singh. “We wanted to have the option in place for Bitcoin users to deposit cryptocurrency into their Fanduel accounts and take advantage of the daily fantasy sports games.”

Fanduel’s Past Issues With Payment Processors and the ‘Bitcoin Bowl’

People have wanted Fanduel to accept bitcoin for years now and it was discussed back in Feb. 2016 when Fanduel and Draftkings lost a major payment provider. At the time, Fanduel and Draftkings commanded more than 90% of the daily fantasy sports (DFS) market. A few states in the U.S. decided that DFS was a form of illegal online gambling and prohibited residents from using the two sites. One of Fanduel and Draftkings’ payment processors at the time was a firm called Vantiv Entertainment Solutions who decided to end the financial relationship abruptly. Jonathan Ellman, chief transaction and marketing counsel at Vantiv, said it was due to “an increasing number of state attorneys general have determined that daily fantasy sports (‘D.F.S.’) constitute illegal gambling.” Draftkings was upset that Vantiv pulled out of the partnership and claimed Vantiv was under “court order to continue to fulfill its contractual obligation to Draftkings.”

Fanduel and Draftkings didn’t seek out cryptocurrencies at the time but Fanduel has dealt with digital assets in the past. In Jan. 2018 the company had a “Bitcoin Bowl” contest and gave away a total of 3.75 BTC to the winners in a free match. Out of the jackpot, 2 BTC was awarded to tournament players who paid $3 to enter the game. Users had to provide a valid BTC address after the playoffs were finished in order to receive the winning prizes. “When your team makes the playoffs, the sky’s the limit — And from what we’ve read online, bitcoin investors know exactly how that feels,” Fanduel’s website read at the time. “So, for week one of the playoffs, we’re giving you two chances to hop on the ultimate bandwagon and play to win some bitcoins of your own.”

Smaller DFS Platforms and Regulators

That same month, Fanduel surpassed over 6 million registrants and the company’s chief financial officer Andy Giancamilli said he recognized a good portion of the company’s user base had an interest in bitcoin. Moreover, Giancamilli commented that the company had always searched for unique prizes. Even though it’s the biggest, Fanduel isn’t the only fantasy sports platform that accepts bitcoin, as a number of smaller portals offer crypto payments as well. There’s fantasy sports sites and DFS tournaments like Gtbets, MVP Lineup, Fantasy Factor, and No Limit.

Fanduel is available in the U.S. but the site is banned and blocked in Alabama, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, New York, Washington, and Texas. The UK Gambling Commission was the first region worldwide to include the regulation of cryptocurrencies and DFS gambling in 2016 and the Isle of Man Gambling Commission followed suit shortly after. At the time, the UK Gambling Commission was the first major regulator to authorize digital currency gambling with KYC/AML guidelines. With Fanduel allowed to accept BCH and BTC for DFS wagers, U.S. regulators may follow behind the U.K. as well.

As Bloomberg reported on Sept. 4, the government was urged to take action after some citizens in the central African country lost money while dealing with digital currencies. Crypto trading was subsequently banned.

Alfred Nyobewumusi, a director at the central bank’s microfinance department, said: “Strong measures could be taken against all those who will not respect this decision.”

Troubled relations with crypto in Africa

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the deputy governor of the Bank of Uganda, Louis Kasekende, has warned the public about the limited protections they have when investing in unregulated cryptocurrencies.

In his remarks, Kasekende stressed that the central bank does not have a comprehensive oversight of all financial services firms and institutions — and that its supervision typically covers commercial banks, credit institutions, foreign exchange bureaus and money remittance service providers.

Reasons to Play Online Cryptocurrency Roulette

As with everything in life, especially gambling, playing online Bitcoin roulette isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. The main disadvantage of playing cryptocurrency roulette is the fluctuating price of the cryptocurrencies themselves. You could win big but if the prices of crypto go down -- so do your winnings. Then again, you could win small and the price goes up! It’s all up to fate.

Speaking of pros and cons, here’s a little list of them.



1. Accessibility

Roulette, much like gambling itself, is part of a regulatory industry with tough laws. Laws are strict and punishments can be harsh. Unfortunately, since gambling deals with finance, roulette players often experience negative side effects when new regulations are released that impact their favorite crypto roulette sites (or traditional ones as well). The hardest hit are often U.S. customers -- since the U.S. seems to have very prudish laws about everything (except guns).

During the early days of Bitcoin, crypto roulette players could avoid local gambling laws. Since governments didn’t know or didn’t care about “fake internet money” -- bitcoin roulette sites were able to get away with weak know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. However, the golden days ended.

These days, if you do enough digging, you can learn to be fully anonymous on bitcoin casino roulette sites like NitrogenSports and others.

Takeaway: if you use a good VPN service -- the bitcoin gambling roulette world can open up a lot more.



2. Anonymity

Privacy is something that everyone can appreciate -- especially when it comes to financial privacy. Thankfully, online bitcoin roulette can provide that. Some of the best bitcoin gambling sites, such as NitrogenSports, prioritize anonymity over other qualities and offer this to customers. This gives them an edge.

Such anonymity is highly prized by undercover gamblers. The ability to earn money on casino games without being required to list and verify your name and address is a big plus for many people.

KYC regulations in the casino sphere that are loose will inspire players to stick to online bitcoin roulette sites that know how to offer a higher level of privacy. Many traditional fiat-only gamblers have become interested in BTC roulette for exactly the reason of privacy -- which has proved profitable and fun for them.



3. Lower Fees

Cryptocurrencies started off trying to be decentralized digital cash. Digital cash is the keystone helping bitcoin casino roulette players to bet, win, and transfer value in a fast and somewhat discrete manner. Since no middle man -- like a bank or fiat transfer service -- needs to take his cut -- the fees for playing bitcoin casino roulette are lower. Win-win.

Transferring Bitcoin to the best bitcoin roulette sites -- such as those mentioned above -- will only involve paying the cryptocurrency specific mining fees -- which can be quite minimal depending on the currency. If fees aren’t low -- look to see if the bitcoin roulette site is charging you a fee and keeping it for themselves.



4. Provably Fair

Trusting the cryptocurrency roulette sites you use is crucial. You want to be sure that your funds are secure, the bitcoin roulette website is legally compliant (and doesn’t get raided and shut down by the government), and most of all - ensure that the odds are fair when playing all their games.

There is a term in the crypto industry called provably fair. It’s quite fascinating and, in a nutshell, it shows the algorithm used for generating odds in a mathematical way -- and thus helping you or anyone verify fairness.

Making online bitcoin gambling roulette provably fair is possible because of blockchain technology. Almost all cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology -- thus helping bring trust to the idea of digital cash. The best crypto roulette sites make sure to integrate the ‘provably fair’ feature throughout their games. This not only reassures players -- it also shows that the bitcoin roulette site is undoubtedly fair.

Summary - Which Bitcoin Roulette Site is Right For You?

So, now that you have all this information and comparisons between the best bitcoin roulette sites, here’s my final takeaway:

Set some time aside and register on all the crypto roulette sites I mentioned. Even if they don’t seem to be available in your country -- try anyway -- you might be surprised.

Even if they don’t seem to be available in your country -- try anyway -- you might be surprised. Everyone has different tastes when it comes to gambling and playing crypto roulette. Your experience is the only one that matters!

FAQ

Are roulette sites that accept crypto legal?

Yes. Sites that accept crypto treat it as simply another form of payment. Therefore if it’s legal for you to play on a roulette site using fiat funds, it will be legal to play roulette using cryptocurrencies. Be sure to find out if your citizenship and location is one that allows playing bitcoin roulette online in the first place.

How to place bets with crypto on roulette sites?

Easy. Find out if you are legally allowed to play there based on your citizenship. Then, sign up at a site you enjoy. Deposit bitcoin or the crypto of your choice. Place bets according to the site (which will often convert your crypto into fiat). Then withdraw your winnings to the crypto address of your choice.

What’s the best bitcoin roulette site in your opinion?

The best bitcoin roulette site is always the one that allows you to play legally. After that, the best site is one that fits your other needs: type of crypto accepted, withdrawal limits, bonuses, and VIP packages. All those factors come into play when deciding which site is the safest and most fun to play.

Why do gamblers love bitcoin roulette?

Bitcoin roulette has the most advantage over fiat roulette because your deposits and withdrawals will be faster and will often cost less than those with fiat funds. These advantages also help roulette sites offer bigger bonuses and better VIP programs for their loyal players.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/venture-capitalist-fred-wilson-revises-his-bullish-opinion-on-ether,"Fred Wilson, a financier and co-founder of venture capital firm Union Square Ventures, has revised his bullish opinion on Ether (ETH).

Back in 2017, Wilson had suggested the market capitalization of Ether will bypass the market capitalization of Bitcoin (BTC) and eventually be worth more per coin. However, in a Sept. 4 blog post, Wilson acknowledged ETH has fallen short of this — and that the underlying Ethereum network is experiencing problems. He wrote:

“Ethereum, as many of you know, confounds me. It has shown the way to so many important things; smart contracts, programmable trust-free computing, potentially proof of stake, and a lot more. But it remains hard to build on, scaling issues abound, and many developers are looking elsewhere.”

Last month, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin himself admitted that the Ethereum blockchain is almost full. Buterin said at the time: “If you’re a bigger organization, the calculus is that if we join, it will not only be more full but we will be competing with everyone for transaction space. It’s already expensive and it will be even five times more expensive because of us.”

Ether is no match for Bitcoin

Referring to Bitcoin, Wilson said there is still nothing on the market that comes close to the leading digital currency, adding: “There are some protocols, like the privacy-focused ones, that offer similar and in some cases better use cases. But for the most part, Bitcoin is our digital gold.”

The venture capitalist also touched on the issue of Facebook’s yet-to-be-released Libra stablecoin, calling it a bright spot. In Wilson’s opinion, the industry will see more innovation, including a stable programmable crypto asset.

In January, Wilson had warned cryptocurrency will not be a safe haven in 2019 amid a weakening economy and a bear market in stocks, although he noted that “there will be signs of life in crypto land in 2019.” As for the impetus for the next bullish phase, Wilson listed a number of promises made back in 2017, including a number of smart contract platforms that can compete with Ethereum.

Cryptocurrency investor and Placeholder partner Chris Burniske argued in late August that Ether is enduring its first mainstream bear market, just as Bitcoin did back in 2014–15.",,https://www.coindesk.com/why-the-marshall-islands-is-issuing-its-own-cryptocurrency,"The Honorable David Paul is Minister In-Assistance to the President and Environment, Marshall Islands.

This essay is presented as a part of No Closing Bell, a series leading up to Invest: Asia 2019 focused on how the Asian crypto markets are interacting with and impacting global investors. To keep the conversation going in person, register for Invest: Asia 2019 coming up in Singapore on Sept. 11-12.

Since becoming an independent democratic nation in 1979, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has used the US dollar as money. Today we are progressing with our plan to issue a sovereign currency in digital form – using blockchain technology.

Last year, we passed the Sovereign Currency Act, declaring our intention to issue a new currency, the Marshallese sovereign (SOV), which we will use alongside the dollar. Issuing a currency is of course the prerogative of any sovereign nation, but what is unprecedented is that we have chosen to issue our sovereign currency using blockchain technology.

We made three key decisions when we chose to issue our currency. First, that the currency would be based on blockchain technology – this is vital for us in the Marshall Islands, for reasons I will outline below. Second, that the growth of our money supply would be predetermined and tamper proof. And, last but not least, that compliance would be baked into the currency protocol itself, while maintaining privacy for individuals.

The advent of blockchain technology has opened up a world of opportunity for small nations like ours. Relying on traditional fiat currency, the Marshall Islands has only fragile links to the wider world of international finance, and compliance is extremely resource intensive. Many of our citizens send or receive money using remittance services, paying fees of up to 10% per transaction. Even simple things like acquiring and installing ATMs become complicated when you’re in the middle of the Pacific Ocean!

But blockchain transactions are fast, simple, and cheap. Blockchain transactions are secure, because they’re replicated throughout a decentralized network. Most importantly, and despite its mathematical and technical complexity, blockchain is practically very simple. The only infrastructure needed for a blockchain-based digital currency is the network itself. We do not need to create a central bank and manage the printing and processing of paper money.

We chose to create a fixed money supply with fixed growth because fiat currencies can be remarkably unstable. For example, the Argentine peso recently fell 15% in a single day, while Venezuela’s currency, for all intents and purposes, no longer functions at all. The policies of major central banks are not reassuring, as the gold and bitcoin prices attest. We as governments need to take a more sustainable approach to money, and not treat it as a limitless resource.

Our money supply will grow at a sustainable 4% each year, following Milton Friedman’s k% rule. New SOV will be automatically distributed to the currency holders and the decentralized entities securing the network. This means that we in government cannot modify the money supply, and we cannot manipulate the value of our currency by printing more money.

Finally, our currency must be internationally accepted. Post 9/11, money laundering and financing of terrorism are major threats that the global community is fighting together. But without our own currency, and beholden to existing systems, it is hard for us to contribute much to this fight beyond basic compliance. With a digital currency based on blockchain, we can automate much of the compliance burden and take a proactive role on the international stage.

Every individual using SOV must be identified by an approved verifier of their choice, such as a bank or an exchange. This will close the secrecy and anonymity loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists. However, it is crucial that individual users should have a reasonable expectation of privacy – specifically, the ability to choose when to disclose your information, what exactly to share, and with whom. We are committed to providing this privacy with SOV.

The Marshall Islands are working closely with international regulatory bodies to ensure SOV meets all compliance requirements and can be fully integrated into the international financial ecosystem. In fact, SOV is being digitally engineered from the ground up to prevent misuse, unlike paper currencies.

For years, the Marshall Islands have been exploring ways to enhance its connectivity to the international financial system. By issuing a currency that is not physically embodied in cash, that can travel the globe instantly, and that is tamper-proof and completely secure, the Marshall Islands will finally be connected to the global financial system on its own terms.

It may seem surprising that the Republic of the Marshall Islands would be issuing a currency based on blockchain technology, but actually it’s just the opposite: the Marshallese people have lived with decentralized systems for hundreds of years. For us, a country of just over 50,000 people spread across more than 1,000 Pacific islands, centralized solutions aren’t just inefficient: they’re completely unworkable. Blockchain has given us the opportunity to finally acquire monetary independence in a way that reflects Marshallese values. We intend to grasp that opportunity, innovatively and responsibly.

Minister Paul will make an announcement around the Marshall Island’s sovereign issuance at Invest: Asia 2019.

The average retail Joe Schmoe investor most likely draws some insight from crypto-sector leaders and Crypto-Twitter influencers who often post compelling charts of various digital assets with a captioned explanation of why or why not certain price action could lead to a particular outcome.

To review, here what many investors may have internalized as truth:

When Bitcoin (BTC) price consolidates (trades sideways) traders will take their profits and begin to play larger-cap altcoins, this catalyzes similar movement across other altcoins and could spark an altcoin rally.

As Bitcoin price notches new 2019 highs, larger cap altcoins from the top-10 will move in tandem.

A significant drop in Bitcoin market cap dominance will put the ball in altcoins’ court.

So far, none of these things have happened. In fact, the situation for the majority of altcoins has gotten even worse.

To gain more clarity on this situation, Cointelegraph decided to ask a professional fund manager to explain what is going on with the crypto sector and why altcoins haven’t followed Bitcoin as they did in the past.

Cointelegraph spoke with Cantering Clark, a hedge fund manager and co-founder of Blockroots, to pick his brain about the general state of the market and whether altcoins will recover.

Cointelegraph: Bitcoin has had some periods of range-bound trading since topping out at $13,800. In your opinion, why haven’t we seen traders take advantage of this consolidation to jump into altcoins? Also, what exactly is “altseason” in your opinion?

Cantering Clark: Altseason was essentially a bunch of new investors entering the crypto space, drawn in by Bitcoin. They saw Bitcoin as being very expensive and the perception at the time was cheaper altcoins are going to be future Bitcoins in the making.

Newer investors were relatively ignorant of market cap and multiplier effects, they just saw the smaller price and equated a cheaper price to a better deal.

In my opinion, altcoins were the epitome of the bubble for 2017 and the process closely mirrored the Gartner Hype Cycle.

Bitcoin is essentially the chosen asset by the industry and it has become the haven of crypto. When Bitcoin does well there are flows that can be capitalized on but this flow cycle has begun to untether and fall apart.

The inverse correlation and positive correlation is no longer a conventional occurrence that investors can consistently rely on.

“Bitcoin price hasn’t broken it's all-time high, and the next altseason is unlikely to occur until this all-time high is broken.”

CT: Shouldn’t a drop in Bitcoin dominance lead altcoins to surge?

CC: If Bitcoin’s dominance rate dropped to 40% this would probably bring on an altseason but it's unlikely that this sort of dominance shift is in the cards at the moment.

CT: Do you think investors’ confirmation bias impacts Bitcoin price action? For example, many investors believe that if Bitcoin must drop below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level before a real bull market begins.

CC: Bitcoin is so volatile and it has been through every asset scenario possible. Moving averages are useful because traders make them useful.

The collective effort of traders makes the necessity of Bitcoin revisiting any price more “likely” thanks to the groupthink. Fibonacci retracements work because we make them work and we place bids and asks on the order book accordingly. Basically, nearly all resistances and supports are based on this thinking.

A revisit to the 61.8 Fib level diminishes the likelihood of us going way back up because it demonstrates that buyers are reluctant to step in and purchase at a higher price, or before that price is reached.

As for Crypto-Twitter, there is a deluge of cognitive biases to be found there every day. We should work to avoid confirmation bias and this is why I suggest reading Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.

CT: Tell us about what led you to invest in cryptocurrency.

CC: I was drawn to crypto primarily because of the volatility.

CT: Give us your best explanation of how leveraged trading works and how one can use it to their advantage.

CC: In crypto, people use leverage to amplify gains through greater capital exposure. More often than not, traders take on losses because they don’t truly understand how margin works and what it is truly designed for.

Margin/leverage mitigates counterparty risk, and this is especially beneficial for crypto. With leverage, if I own 1 BTC, I can keep 90% of my BTC in a cold wallet and just put 10% of the BTC on exchange and protect myself from counterparty risk.

Leverage also gives the opportunity to trade both sides of the market. Frequently, traders use too much leverage and get liquidated as the market moves against them but a healthy amount of leverage gives the opportunity to take advantage of market trends.

2x and 3x leverage allows one to play the trend, especially when Bitcoin is in a strong trend with clear support and resistance levels.

CT: Tell us a little about Blockroots?

CC: Our main objective is to educate new traders and separate the truth from the noise. There are a ton of paid groups and these are not always the best way for new traders to learn how to understand the basics of investing.

One of the troubling aspects of the cryptocurrency market is there are so many trading groups and newbies who copy the trading systems proposed in paid groups a kind of taking a shot in the dark. New traders really aren’t fully aware of how effective these trading systems are they don’t have transparency regarding the trader’s success rate. Blockroots provides an academic, base-level trading approach to help new traders find their way.

To make matters worse, Ethereum‘s market is on the verge of a “death cross.” This is a spooky technical pattern that’s only happened three times before in its history, reports digital asset research firm Delphi Digital in commentary shared with Hard Fork.

“Death crosses” occur when an asset’s moving price average over the past 50 days dips (or ‘crosses’) below the moving price average over the past 200 days. These are highlighted on the chart below by red circles.

Notice that the blue line and the red line ‘cross.’ This can be bad.

“The historical precedent for such an event is quite limited given its relatively short price history, but in the three prior instances, ETH’s average loss in the following 14 and 30 days was 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively,” said Delphi Digital.

“The most recent death cross occurred in April 2018 after ETH tumbled more than 20 percent in the 30 days leading up to the event,” it added. “It proceeded to fall another 14 percent over the subsequent two weeks.”

Prior ‘death crosses’ occurred in Sept and Nov 2017.

Bagholder’s favorite cryptocurrency BNB hasn’t posted gains in a while

When it comes to the broader cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has been killing it. Over the past 90 days, its price has risen over 36 percent, which makes it the best performing large-cap digital asset over that period.

“Price does not necessarily reflect the true intrinsic value of any given token or coin, but the growing sophistication among crypto investors coupled with the strengthening ‘digital gold’ narrative for Bitcoin has helped suppress much of the publicly traded crypto market in recent months,” said Delphi Digital.

Table courtesy of Delphi Digital, data as of 9/2/19

Binance Coin (BNB), the branded token of prominent cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has performed much worse over the past three months.

Last week, BNB dropped 13 percent, which Delphi Digital noted as the second straight week that it’s been found among the worst-performing large-cap digital assets.

Stellar Lumens (XLM) is also heavily down, with its US-dollar value essentially halving over the past 90 days.

The suffering of alt-coin markets can be further represented by Bitcoin‘s increasing “market dominance,” which recently hit 70 percent for the first time since March 2017.

That sounds impressive, but you can read more on why that doesn’t mean shit, as it’s a metric based on some pretty flawed concepts.

According to a report on Wednesday, two sources said that Blockchain is in discussions with investors to raise $50 million for the fund.

The LinkedIn profile for Sam Harrison – a Blockchain managing partner who was previously a principal at investment firm Naspers Ventures – further suggests the fund is already in existence and is also backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, a Blockchain investor.

It states:

“Co-founded Blockchain.com Ventures – A Venture Capital Fund anchored by Blockchain.com, the world’s largest non-custodial wallet platform & Lightspeed Venture Partners.”

The text further suggests that the fund has already invested in some firms, including Origin Protocol, Coindirect, Sliver.tv and Nodle.

According to Crunchbase, Blockchain itself has raised $70 million over four rounds, including a $40 million Series B that saw Richard Branson and Lightspeed Venture Partners participate.

The Hong Kong-licensed firm announced on Wednesday that the scheme will be on offer to both employees of participating firms and the self-employed, and will offer an underlying portfolio that includes cryptos as well as fiat currencies. It’s also expected to appeal to crypto investors.

Legacy Trust CEO Vincent Chok said:

“We envisage that this will appeal to businesses who are active in the digital assets space, and who want to offer additional benefits to their employees to retain talent and recognise achievement. What better way to drive employee loyalty while allowing valuable staff to participate in the growth of the company and the digital asset space?”

The plan will be funded by either voluntary contributions or deducted directly from an employees salary. The pension will be paid out after retirement of the scheme member, or to beneficiaries in the event of their death.

Legacy Trust said the plan “addresses various tax concerns for digital assets holders,” though it did not offer any details.

In March, the firm partnered with hardware wallet maker Ledger to offer “institutional-grade” cryptocurrency custody.

By utilizing Ledger’s multi-signature cryptocurrency wallet management product Ledger Vault, Legacy Trust said at the time it would be able to “securely and efficiently” custody clients’ digital assets, such as bitcoin and ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens.

The 12% seven-day gains excited analysts, who abandoned bearish sentiment to forecast a continuation of upward momentum. A subsequent slowdown in growth has tempered those aspirations, however, with markets now waiting for outside events to sway the mood.

For Filb Filb, a popular Bitcoin trader, the launch of institutional trading platform Bakkt later in September is the closest such deciding moment.

“Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $10k,” he summarized in private comments, adding:

“A lot of people are hoping to get bids filled below $9k; the market rarely gets what it wants and I wouldn’t be surprised if they are forced to buy higher. But let’s see what happens with the launch of Bakkt.”

While opinions suggest demand for Bakkt’s physical Bitcoin futures will be high, activity has yet to kick off, with client deposits beginning on Friday this week.

Altcoins continue to bite the dust

Bitcoin’s latest consolidation meanwhile continues to pile pressure on altcoin markets. Most major tokens lost several percentage points in U.S. dollar terms on Thursday, having failed to rally in line with Bitcoin.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, fared worse than any in the top twenty, dropping 3.4% to hit $171.

“A break below the $160 handle would spell disaster for the bulls. I'd assume most /USD pairs, including Bitcoin would dump as well,” he wrote.

She addressed the new asset class as part of a talk on the future of digital payments and the company's push into the sector.

Bailey's comments follow the August release of the Apple Card, a credit card made in collaboration with Mastercard and Goldman Sachs. The card served as the first major expansion of Apple's consumer finance products since Apple Pay launched in October 2014.

Apple's potential move into digital coins would serve as ""a major shot in the arm for crypto,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNN Business. He added that the interest in crypto ""could make sense given its sights on further monetizing its consumers.""

The introduction of finance products would fall in line with Apple's continued push into service revenue growth. Its Services business now contribute to more than one-fifth of the company's quarterly income, and upcoming offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade could further boost its earnings.

Apple traded at $212.30 as of 12:40 p.m. ET Thursday, up about 35% year-to-date.

The product drew scrutiny earlier in the summer as regulators questioned the social network's security and antitrust positioning as a crypto provider.

Payment processing company Square released its own bitcoin trading service through its Square Cash app in January 2018 after a short preview phase.

NOW WATCH: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories",,https://qz.com/1702957/apple-sees-long-term-potential-in-cryptocurrency/,"Could bitcoin become part of our payments future? Apple seems to think so.

In a recent conversation with CNN Business, Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, revealed the company’s awareness of—and perhaps optimism about—the crypto markets.

“We’re watching cryptocurrency,” Bailey said. “We think it’s interesting. We think it has interesting long-term potential.”

Although brief, her commentary offered a glimpse into how the tech giant is approaching bitcoin and the broader crypto market— that is, with an open mind. Today, Apple’s market capitalization is more than five times larger than that of bitcoin (which stands at $188 billion).

Admittedly, it’s hard to discern much from Bailey’s crypto musings. Her phrase—”interesting long-term potential”—leaves the door open for Apple to dabble in crypto itself, or to slam it shut later on.

If Apple does pursue a crypto wallet for the iPhone though, it won’t be the first phone manufacturer to market. HTC’s Exodus 1 already comes packaged with a “secure enclave” meant to keep your crypto holdings separate from other apps on the device, and this week, Samsung launched a blockchain-enabled smartphone (paywall). Samsung’s device is essentially the Galaxy Note 10 with some crypto-cobranding, courtesy of Klaytn, a South Korean blockchain platform. Apple recently launched its own credit card, backed by Mastercard and Goldman Sachs, which primarily exists within the Apple Pay wallet of the owner’s iPhone.

Apple’s reticence probably indicates the company would support existing cryptocurrencies as opposed to creating its own, like Facebook is attempting to do with Libra. It’s done similarly on other standards, such as the communication tech behind Apple Pay, and the wireless-charging standard its newer iPhones use.",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/05/apple-sees-long-term-potential-for-cryptocurrency-exec-says.html,"Apple has become a big player in mobile payments since releasing Apple Pay for the iPhone in 2014 and moving deeper into the market with last month's launch of Apple Card in partnership with Goldman Sachs.

As digital payments evolve, where might Apple head next? Jennifer Bailey, vice president at Apple Pay, said the company is ""watching"" cryptocurrencies, though consumers shouldn't expect anything soon.

""We think it's interesting,"" Bailey said in an interview last week at a CNN Business 'The Table' event , according to a transcript reviewed by CNBC. ""We think it has interesting long-term potential, but we're primarily focused on what consumers are using today.""

Apple hasn't been tied to any cryptocurrency projects and Bailey's comments mark the first time the company has said publicly that it's paying attention to the technology behind bitcoin, ethereum and other decentralized currencies.

A number of technology companies have been much more vocal. Facebook said earlier this year it is planning to launch a cryptocurrency, libra, in 2020 with a consortium of partners including Visa, Stripe, Paypal, Uber and Spotify.

Apple doesn't allow cryptocurrency miners in its App Store platform, although wallets and exchanges like Coinbase are permitted, and the Apple Card can't be used to purchase cryptocurrencies.

In considering what types of applications Apple may consider, Bailey hinted that cryptocurrencies and QR code-based systems like those used in China could be alternatives to credit cards for small businesses that have to pay for every swipe.

""If you look at QR code payment solutions, if you look at the long-term potential of cryptocurrency, I think you'll continue to see that change over time,"" she said.

Bailey touched on other topics, including potential features coming for people interested in financial health, and tools Apple built into the iPhone's wallet software to help with budget spending.

She also talked about the need for proper care of the physical titanium Apple Card, an issue that Apple addresses on its website. Fabrics like leather and denim can cause permanent discoloration to the card.

""Some of the people who worked on the Apple Card, designers, are the same people who lovingly and currently designed our other products,"" she said. ""And so the attention to making sure it's perfect is a part of the culture.""

While the reason for the NSA carrying out such work isn’t clear, quantum computing has the potential to be able to make current blockchain technology redundant.

In a previous report, CoinDesk looked at how, although still in its infancy, quantum computing could one day be able to crack much of the cryptography that underlies how data – including cryptocurrency private keys – passes through the internet.

It should be noted that Neuberger’s comment may indicate that the NSA is working on a cryptography technology, not a cryptocurrency, with the twin meanings of the term “crypto.”

The NSA’s new Cybersecurity Directorate was announced in July and is “charged with preventing and eradicating threats to National Security Systems and the Defense Industrial Base,” according to the agency. It’s expected to start its activities on Oct. 1.

Neuberger led the NSA’s Russia Small Group before moving to take up the reigns at the new cybersecurity division.

According to classified documents obtained by The Intercept in 2018 from U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden, the NSA has made bitcoin surveillance a top priority. One NSA memo suggested the agency had been collecting private information such as bitcoin user passwords, internet activity and device identifiers.

The legendary investor raised concerns about the notion that blockchain, which is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, can't be broken into.

""A lot of people say, 'blockchain can't be broken into.' No, it can be. Anything that's created by man can be broken into. And it could create a big crisis,"" the founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.

Blockchain has gained large amounts of support since the start of the cryptocurreny boom. While traditional currencies are issued by central banks, bitcoin does not have a central authority, making it harder to regulate.

Many federal regulators have raised concerns about the potential illicit use of cryptocurrencies, like Facebook's new digital currency libra.

""There's a whole generation of people who have faith in the internet. They have faith in these cryptocurrenices,"" said Mobius. ""That's all it takes. People believe in the U.S. dollar because they have faith that with dollars in their hands they can buy something.""

Bitcoin blockchain is maintained by a network of people known as miners, who solve complex problems to complete transactions. Crypto enables people to buy something merely because they believe it has value, which he said is very problematic.

""I think people are going to begin to realize that these are very, very risky situations. And by the way, I believe blockchain is a very high-risk situation,"" Mobius said.

He added that a cryptocurrency backed by gold would be interesting.

""If there is a cryptocurrency that is really backed by gold and there is a meaningful agreement and some kind of modern thing of this connection, then this could be quite interesting,"" Mobius said.

Bitcoin last traded around $10,570, up nearly 200% this year but far below its peak in 2017.

The Bank of the Republic of Burundi, the country’s central bank, also made an official statement, declaring digital currencies as illegal tender.

“Since virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies are not regulated and are not issued or guaranteed by any Government or Central Bank, these currencies do not have legal tender in the territory of Burundi,” the central bank stated.

According to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday, the step was taken after some citizens of the African nation lost money while trading cryptocurrencies and asked the government to intervene to recover the losses.

Warning citizens against crypto trading, Alfred Nyobewumusi, a director at the central bank’s micro-finance department, told the publication: “Strong measures could be taken against all those who will not respect this decision.”

Bitcoin and Onecoin – both fall in the same category

In the official notification, the central bank put digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, in the same list with multi-billion dollar scam Onecoin and warned investors of partaking in such investments as no entity offering crypto-based investment products are authorized by it.

“These virtual currencies are traded on unregulated online platforms around the world, and their values ​​are highly volatile, resulting in speculative transactions that expose the users of these currencies to potential losses without no possibility of legal recourse in the event of a collapse of their value or in case of closure of these cryptocurrency exchange platform,” the central bank added.

Contrary to Burundi, Rwanda’s central bank is considering to launch its own digital currency, Finance Magnates reported earlier. The bank, however, is facing some roadblocks with the technology and is currently studying the developments made by other central banks in countries like Canada, Singapore, and the Netherlands in the arena of blockchain technology.",2019-09-05 07:07:35+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/paxful-brings-20-crypto-atms-to-colombia,"A partnership between two cryptocurrency firms could bring 20 new bitcoin ATMs to cities around Colombia.

The bitcoin exchange, Paxful, and crypto ATM company, CoinLogiq, announced the partnership Sept. 5. By integrating the Paxful kiosk feature with CoinLogiq hardware, users will be able to purchase BTC using cash, credit and online debit transfers.

According to Coinatmradar.com, Colombia already boasts 46 bitcoin ATMs, nearly triple the number of all the other terminals located in South America. Further, Paxful conducted a survey of 1,000 random Colombian internet users, and found that nearly 80 percent of Colombians are open to investing in cryptocurrencies.

There are a number of concerns, however. Colombian regulators have thus far exhibited a hardline stance against cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Colombia’s central bank, Banco de la República, decreed crypto does not represent legal tender, while the Superintendencia Financiera (SF) said financial institutions are not authorized to invest, broker, or manage virtual currencies.

Despite these dictates, crypto exchange LocalBitcoins found that transactions made in Colombian pesos spiked 1,200 percent in 2017.

Evidence suggests that demand for crypto in Colombia is at least partially driven by expatriates from neighboring Venezuela. In fact, as previously reported, a cottage industry of crypto exchanges and ATMs has sprouted providing services for Venezuelans to exchange their hyperinflated currency and send remittances back home.

The newly-added ATMs will be placed in shopping centers and other public spots. The machines will allow users to withdraw or deposit cryptocurrencies. Paxful did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Paxful’s manager for Latin America, Magdiela Rivas, said the partnering firms are also working to place 25 new cryptocurrency ATMs in Peru.

This past spring, Apple announced CryptoKit for iOS 13, which will allow developers to easily create hashes for digital signatures and public and private keys that can be stored and managed by Apple's Secure Enclave. Those keys, which can represent cryptocurrencies, can then be exchanged by iPhone owners as a form of payment through an app.

At the time of its release, Apple did not return a request for comment on CryptoKit and whether it is part of a plan to introduce a cryptocurrency wallet.

On Thursday, however, Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, told CNN: ""We're watching cryptocurrency. We think it's interesting. We think it has interesting long-term potential.""

Bailey's comments came during a private event in San Francisco.

If Apple is going down the cryptocurrency path, it would be following HTC and Samsung, who've announced plans to create native cold storage wallets on their smartphones. HTC last year announced that its Exodus 1 smartphone would be able to natively store bitcoin or Ether cryptocurrencies; Samsung is making a big push for the same feature on its flagship Galaxy 10 phone, expected to arrive in February.

Jack Gold, principal analyst with J. Gold Associates, said he doesn't expect Apple to roll out cryptocurrency technology ""right now."" Instead, he expects the company to make sure Apple Pay is working properly and gains marketshare before jumping on a new payment method with ""lots of risk"" – including potential pitfalls from regulators in the U.S. and Europe.

""I’d guess that Apple will react to what others are doing in cryptocurrency..., but only after time to evaluate how successful [they are] and what problems arose,"" Gold said. ""Apple is very good at fixing any perceived problems in technologies and presenting them to end users, but generally does not lead the marketplace, only getting on board after a market is established.""

A study from Juniper Research found that the number of people using digital wallets for all types of currencies is expected to increase from 2.3 billion this year to nearly 4 billion – or 50% of the world's population – by 2024. This, in turn, will push wallet transaction values up by more than 80% to more than $9 trillion a year.

The study indicated the increases would be driven by a greater volume of transactions conducted via stored credentials, like those of a crypto wallet.

Cryptocurrency as a form of payment for services or products has attracted some of the largest names in financial services and social media. For example, earlier this year, JP Morgan Chase announced plans to launch what is considered to be the first cryptocurrency backed by a major bank, a move that could legitimize blockchain as a vehicle for fiat cryptocurrencies.

JPM Coin, as the bank is calling its new cryptocoin, is considered fiat currency because it's backed by U.S. dollars in accounts designated at JPMorgan Chase N.A.

In June, after months of speculation, Facebook announced plans to launch its own cryptocurrency and digital wallet, something experts said should be a clarion call to commercial banks: if you don't begin to explore blockchain technology, tech companies could eat your lunch.

Clifford Rossi, a finance professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, said Facebook's entry into the banking marketplace puts added pressure on commercial banks at a time when they are already scrambling to learn how to compete against nimbler, tech-savvy fintech companies.

Apple launched its mobile payments platform, Apple Pay, in 2014; it processes about one billion transactions a month, according to some reports. And with its entry into the credit card industry this year with its new Apple Card, the company has firmly planted a flag in the fintech market.

Gartner Research Vice President Annette Zimmermann said offering a cryptocurrency is just another way for Apple ""to keep people in their ecosystem and to differentiate via keeping your data private.

""Just like with the Apple Card, that has generally the main function of keeping people in the Apple ecosystem. You have to own an iPhone in order to use an Apple Card. And the company has followed the path of trying to differentiate with safeguarding their users privacy in several areas,"" Zimmermann said.",,https://www.coindesk.com/massive-1-billion-bitcoin-whale-transaction-makes-waves,"A massive 94,505 bitcoin transaction made crypto headlines as investors and investigators speculated from whence the BTC came.

Blockchain analysis firm TokenAnalyst noticed that many of the transactions came from Huobi wallets. “Our team is looking into the validity of the claim,” said a Huobi spokesperson.

Not surprisingly the move changed bitcoin’s price from $10,569 to $10,790 and follows a similarly mysterious $780 million BTC move that took place last week. Others suggested that the move was a deposit into the new Bakkt Warehouse product or liquidated funds from the PlusToken Ponzi scheme.

A third of the coins came from Huobi

According to data by London-based blockchain data provider TokenAnalyst, at least one third of the mysterious transaction directly originates from Huobi exchange. Another analyst, blockchain data and metrics firm Glassnode tweeted that at least 73,000 BTC from the transaction originate from Huobi.

According to an earlier tweet by Crypto Herpes Cat, at least two Bitcoin wallets involved in the notable transaction belong to Huobi. One of the specified wallets is directly involved in the transaction.

Cointelegraph has reached out to Huobi for comments, to which the exchange's representative responded:

“As we don't generally disclose information about transactions, we can only confirm that this transfer of funds did not involve Huobi’s own funds and that, with exchanges as big as ours, large transactions like this one can and do occur from time to time.

Rumors run wild

As reported earlier today, crypto monitoring resource Whale Alert stated that the much-discussed transaction did not involve any known wallets or those belonging to any specific crypto exchange or any crypto-related firm.

Some analysts suggested that funds may be tied to institutional trading platform Bakkt, which starts accepting client deposits today.

Meanwhile, Huobi, which is ranked 20th biggest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trading volume at press time, was reported to have seen the highest number of withdrawals from the alleged crypto Ponzi scheme PlusToken by Aug. 23.

More than USD 1 billion transaction cost BTC 0.06534852 (USD 700) in fees.

According to economist and trader Alex Krüger, the bitcoins on the move belong to the largest non-exchange owned address.

Whichever the case, it’s unusual to observe such large transactions being conducted in one go. According to the blockchain and smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo, such large transaction doesn’t come without risks. For example, it makes it highly lucrative for the recipient to reverse the transaction, assuming that they can afford to run a 51% attack for more than 40 days. Although such a course of action is highly unlikely, he still calls it “tempting fate.”

Such confidence in Bitcoin is splendid, but a 94,500 BTC tx tempts fate. If recipient can make that much from reversing the tx, they can afford to run a 51% attack for more than 40 days.

The news was reported by Cointelegraph Japan on Sept 6.

Trading for 5 major cryptocurrencies

As previously reported, LVC Corp.’s trading platform, to be dubbed BITMAX, will enable Line’s 80 million users in Japan to buy and sell multiple major cryptocurrencies. According to CT Japan, the FSA has authorized the trading of Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and XRP on the platform.

Per a press release recently shared with Cointelegraph, LINE counts 187 million global users monthly, with an estimated 50 million users registered its mobile payment service, LINE Pay.

In July 2018, LINE had launched the Singapore-based, global user-focused crypto exchange BITBOX — and will reportedly repurpose the platform’s back-end infrastructure for its Japanese FSA-approved platform BITMAX.

Due to Japan’s crypto exchange license requirements — in force since the amendment of the country’s Payment Services Act in April 2017 — BITBOX is not accessible for Japanese traders.

LINE’s native token and mainnet

LINE launched its native Link cryptocurrency in late summer 2018 and has since continued to develop a token ecosystem based on its service-oriented blockchain, Link Chain.

The blockchain network also allows for decentralized applications to be directly applied to Line’s messaging platform.

LINK was listed on BITBOX in October 2018. While previous reports indicated that BITMAX, too, will support LINK trades, CT Japan has not indicated that the FSA has formally authorized the token in its list of approved cryptocurrencies for the forthcoming platform.

This June, LINE partnered with American payment services firm Visa on new blockchain and digital payments solutions.",,https://www.twice.com/blog/retailers-are-opening-their-doors-to-paying-with-crypto-is-anyone-buying,"What do AT&T, Starbucks, Microsoft, and Overstock have in common? They all accept crypto, otherwise known as coin, as a form of payment. Over 39,000 stores will now take everything from Bitcoin and BTC, to LiteCoin, the same way that they take cash, credit, debit or mobile payments. But will you buy your next Venti Latte with coin? Welcome to the next chapter of consumerization along the great crypto journey.

In 2014, two CNN reporters tried to live on bitcoin for a day and survived to tell the story. Back then, BitCoin ATMs were actually more plentiful than now, and gyros were purchased with Bitcoin and so were limos. This past February, another reporter in San Francisco attempted to replicate the CNN experiment, but had a tougher time.

Today, there are fewer Bitcoin ATMs and small businesses accepting coin. However, someone’s spending their coins. According to researchers, an estimated $5 billion in crypto was spent in 2018. Plus, the number of people worldwide holding digital assets has reached 30 million – impressive for such a short-lived currency.

Arthur Hayes, founder of Bitmex recently told Bloomberg, “Bitcoin is either worth zero or a lot. Buy what you can afford to lose and HODL.” HODL is the crypto community’s word for the phrase, “Holding On to Your Coins”, and was “coined” in 2013 when a drunken crypto holder mistyped the word “HOLD”.

Additionally, the coin holders I spoke with weren’t too excited about cashing coins for coffee. Brian Zisk, a longtime crypto enthusiast confided, “I should be spending crypto everywhere, but the requirements are too odious.”

Peter Wokwicz, an advisor to a variety of high tech companies, concurred. “Government regulations are the primary blocker in wider acceptance of crypto for payments. Until this changes, merchants will be tentative on wider adoption.”

Despite the fact that the systems are open for business and transaction speeds can now be faster than the Mastercard/Visa network, and transaction costs are much lower, Wokwicz added that merchant adoption is slower than what most expected.

Chris Byrne, CEO at Overstock, a large Internet retailer, is the father of crypto-accepting retail. Because of his visionary exuberance, (the company’s plans for blockchain go far beyond buying consumer goods) Overstock has been accepting crypto payments since 2014, partnering with Coinbase, a crypto wallet. Byrne even paid his corporate taxes in crypto last year using OhioCrypto.com’s website.

Microsoft, Newegg, Dell and a few other retailers were early adopters too, but merchants are proceeding cautiously for numerous reasons, including latency of the transaction time and upgraded POS requirements combined with coin’s volatility in the market. A wide range of intermediary exchanges are jumping in to fill the gap between coin and the purchase of physical goods, and anxious coin companies have begun to introduce coin-backed credit cards to help consumers start spending their coin on physical goods.

Last month, The LiteCoinFoundation announced a partnership with Bibox Exchange and blockchain firm Ternio to release a physical cryptocurrency debit card. Coinbase has also launched a credit card backed by Visa that can be used internationally.

Other intermediaries let you use coin to buy physical goods by handling the conversion for the vendor. Flexa is a B2B solution that allows consumers to spend cryptocurrency in physical stores Acting as an intermediary, Flexa accepts crypto from various wallets, pays the merchants in USD, and then goes through the more laborious process of cashing your coin.

Consumers will need to download Flexa’s app, SPEDN, onto their mobile device to shop. When the customer checkouts at a supported merchant’s store, SPEDN generates a QR code that scans at the checkout register. The merchant receives immediate payment in dollars and the customer’s digital wallet is debited the exact amount in cryptocurrency at the time of purchase. The technology supports Bitcoin, Ether, BTC, and the Gemini dollar. Flexa says it ultimately wants to expand to every retailer, but for now the retailer needs to be compliant on the POS side.

PaywithMoon, another new payments platform, just completed a special 5% promotional discount program for its members who used crypto during Amazon Prime Day. “While the numbers of people paying with crypto on Amazon is still a small fraction, Moon broke all previous records for consumers buying physical goods,” said Keith Kruger, CEO of Moon in our interview.

The brilliant irony of Pay with Moon is that vendors like Amazon don’t need to be involved, nor do you need their permission, to pay with crypto. PaywithMoon acts an intermediary. After downloading the app, customers select which crypto (BitCoin, LiteCoin or BTC) they want to use from any digital wallet. Pay with Moon pays the merchants with USD the moment the pay button is hit, and then resolves the crypto payments with 3rd party intermediaries.

Coin companies can benefit from merchant acceptance as coins become legitimized as something other than a stored value that sits in a wallet. With companies like Facebook and it’s blockchain arm, Libra, getting the attention of regulators, we’re likely to see even more clarity for consumers. For now, the fact is that merchants are accepting coin, even if the percentage of folks using it is low. As Glenn Fodor of First Payments said in a speech to the New York BitAngels and Ideanomics, “The genie is out of the bottle.”

Ryyti: Women “more risk-conscious”

In a Twitter discussion on Sept. 5, Miss Universe Finland 2015 winner, Rosa-Maria Ryyti, argued Bitcoin’s risk factor made it more appealing to men.

She was responding to a query by analyst and Cointelegraph contributor, Filb Filb, who asked followers why the Bitcoin community was overwhelmingly male.

“Women are more risk-conscious in general and often go for a ‘slow & steady’ investment strategy,” Ryyti wrote, adding:

“The current general perception of Bitcoin in the msm makes it even less probable for the average women (and men) to get involved.”

Is crypto shifting the gender balance?

Data currently available suggests around 90% of Bitcoin users are male. The phenomenon has frequently sparked debate, with dedicated structures set up in order to increase female involvement.

Keene New Hampshire: The Free State Project’s Crypto Mecca

New Hampshire is well known for having a large number of libertarian residents since the Free State Project (FSP) started a movement of political migration in 2001 in the low-population New England state. Libertarians in the region promote free markets, stand against war, and are either completely anti-state (anarchism) or believe in a very limited government (minarchism). Many of these activists who migrated to New Hampshire are strewn across the state but there are dense regions of libertarian proponents in places like Keene, Portsmouth, and Manchester. Due to the vast amount of free market believers, there’s a slew of businesses in places like Keene that accept digital currencies like bitcoin cash. The liberty loving blog, Free Keene, revealed that the Monadnock Decentralized Currency Network managed to persuade a bunch of mom-n-pop shops to accept cryptocurrencies over the years.

In fact, throughout the lifetime of the Free State’s activism spent bolstering the concepts of liberty and voluntaryism, the people living there have created a cryptocurrency mecca. Free Keene blog author, Ian Freeman (also the co-host of Free Talk Live) explained on Sep. 3 that last week, two well-known and busy convenience stores now accept a variety of digital assets including bitcoin cash. My Campus Convenience (Campco) store will compete with Corner News which has been accepting crypto since 2013. Keene has a wide variety of digital currency-accepting businesses and lots of them use the Anypay payment processor.

Other businesses that have adopted bitcoin cash include a bar called the Thirsty Owl, Dr. Drower Dentistry, Curry Indian Restaurant, a hair salon, and vape shop. Freeman details that according to data stemming from the Anypay and Marco Coino merchant map there are 15 bitcoin cash-accepting businesses in the region. This works out as a ratio of “one business for every 1,533 people,” Freeman explained. The Anypay merchant map not only shows people where crypto merchants are located, but also displays when someone purchases something with cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin Radio Ads, Crypto Tips, and Educational Resources at the Bitcoin Embassy New Hampshire

The Bitcoin Embassy New Hampshire located in Keene is also well known for its Bitcoin radio advertisements that promote the benefits of cryptocurrencies and free markets. Starting in 2016, the commercials were syndicated on “The Peak” (101.9 WKKN-FM Keene, 100.7 WTHK-FM Wilmington, VT, and 104.7 W284AB Jamaica, VT) seven days a week from 3pm-6am EDT. “Bitcoin is a powerful local currency that can also be used internationally. It’s Keene to buy local, and Bitcoin empowers local business owners to keep more from each sale, rather than sending 3% outside of the area to credit card companies,” the radio ad’s message said.

More recently, due to the frictionless and low network fees on the Bitcoin Cash network, activists in Keene have been opting to use and promote BCH regularly. Last summer, Freeman helped launch a new website called Cryptotip.org that creates cryptocurrency tips from bitcoin cash (BCH) and dash, making it easier for residents to tip people in sound money. At the time, Freeman remarked that lots of Keene residents used an application called Bctip.org but BTC network fees became unsustainable and the platform was basically neutered. So Freeman reached out to the creator who told him the platform was open source and he and Michael Hampton of Ringing Liberty redesigned it to work with bitcoin cash and dash. The cryptocurrency dash has a decent-sized following in Keene too and many Dash supporters live in the FSP region.

The month prior, in July, the Free Keene blog explained that longtime readers of the blog understood that “Keene and Portsmouth, New Hampshire are two hotspots in the world of cryptocurrency.” “Through real-life crypto usage is not all about delicious handmade pizza, BBQ, Indian food, burgers, or alcoholic beverages that you can buy with crypto in downtown Keene, it’s also about products and services.” When the BCH chain turned two years old on August 1, Free Keene’s Chris Rietmann held a presentation and discussion at the Bitcoin Embassy New Hampshire about the last two years of the Bitcoin Cash network. Rietmann’s two-year BCH retrospective goes into great detail about the scaling debate and why the Bitcoin Cash network is here and thriving today.

Alongside being a crypto mecca, Keene and New Hampshire also have a lot more to offer to people who are interested in libertarianism and plan to join the ongoing NH Freedom Migration.

Here is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph en Español.

Mexico fines up to $47,000 for unauthorized use of crypto

The Central Bank of Mexico will now impose fines up to $47,000 to those who are using crypto assets without its authorization. The bank believes that the use of crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) facilitates illegal activities such as money laundering and is risky due to crypto’s high volatility.

Mexico is reportedly the third largest country in Latin America by number of internet users who are familiar with cryptocurrencies — just below Brazil and Colombia.

Venezuelan traders on LocalBitcoins platform fight to control price

On Sept. 4, it was reported that traders on LocalBitcoins, one of the most used peer-to-peer platforms in Venezuela for both the purchase and sale of Bitcoins with Venezuelan bolivars (VES), seemingly tried to control the BTC/VES rate with some traders trying to push the prices higher, while others were fighting to keep prices lower. The dispute was eventually won by those who posted lower prices for the BTC/VES rate.

In Venezuela, the national government does not provide official exchange rates based on macroeconomic indicators. As such, Venezuelans must rely on microeconomic indicators to determine the bolivar/U.S. dollar exchange rate. Traditionally this meant looking to rates offered at exchange houses in border towns in Brazil and Colombia, but the methodology to determine those rates was not transparent, giving rise to the need for another indicator.

As such, Bitcoin serves as an indicator for Venezuelans to determine the value of the bolivar/dollar exchange rate. Once traders on LocalBitcoin secured a lower price, it reportedly lowered the price of dollars handled in the Venezuelan economy.

South Korean blockchain delegation visits Peru

Peru Compras, the Peruvian state institution responsible for carrying out public bidding processes, welcomed a South Korean delegation to evaluate a blockchain network that the agency is developing. The Korean delegation said they were interested in learning more about how this technology can be applied in public bidding. Peruvian officials explained how blockchain technology is applied to the process and demonstrated the approval process and requirements for participants.

Over the last 24 hours, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been discussing a transaction that saw 94,000 BTC sent to an unknown wallet. The hoopla over the large transaction shows how things have changed significantly over the last decade. Back in cryptocurrency’s early days, between 2010-2012, large bitcoin transactions like this weren’t such a big deal and early adopters practically gave them away.

When Sending Thousands of Bitcoins Wasn’t a Big Deal

There’s been an awful lot of excitement surrounding the 94,504 BTC sent to an unknown address for a network fee of around $700. It’s an interesting sight for sure, when large sums like that are not regularly moved in such a fashion in 2019. However, back in the early days between 2010-2012 people saw large transactions like this all the time, without batting an eye, and fees were less than a U.S. penny per transaction. The big transaction on Sep. 6 reminded former Bitcoin Core developer, Jeff Garzik, about the early days when individuals transacted with thousands of BTC every day. “Today’s 94k BTC transfer, for no particular reason, reminds me of William P, who rented a ridiculous number of AWS machines to CPU-mine Bitcoin in 2010; resulted in 40,000 BTC at [so we thought at the time] exorbitant cloud computing rates,” Garzik recalled. Last year, after recalling the famous pizza transaction, Garzik remembered when he gave away thousands of BTC to help bolster open source development. Garzik explained:

In 2010-2011, I gave away 15,678 BTC in developer bounties.

Back then everyone practically gave BTC away for free or for way less than what people sell them for today. Gavin Andresen and others gave away 10,000 BTC by building a bitcoin faucet that would dispense funds for free. Just like the 94k BTC transaction sent on Friday, individuals who played the game Second Life spent close to 94k BTC every 30 days on Linden dollars in the summer of 2011. Thanks to platforms like Virwox, hundreds of thousands of bitcoins were funneled into the Second Life economy to purchase digital cars and virtual mansions.

Earlier that year the Silk Road started operations and people directed hundreds of thousands of bitcoins into the underground marketplace. In June 2011, according to Gawker’s now famous article, a sheet of acid (LSD) on the Silk Road (SR) cost 50 BTC which is a whopping $520,000 today. An eighth of decent cannabis was a mere 7.63 BTC on SR and today that’s a $79,000 bag. Let’s just say a lot of grams of powder, bags, and sheets were sold for large sums of BTC. That summer there were 340 types of narcotics available for purchase on SR and one bitcoin was worth about $8.67.

Illiquid Exchanges and the Tennessean With 371,000 BTC

If someone wanted to purchase bitcoins fast, in the early days getting money in and out of the BTC system was way more difficult than it is today. Today there are hundreds of exchanges and over the last 24 hours, there’s been $15 billion worth of BTC trade volume. For instance, Bitcoin.com just launched a secure, professional-grade trading platform called exchange.Bitcoin.com. In Oct. 2011, you only had a few options to get into Bitcoin: mail a check, wire money, or use Dwolla. The few exchanges that did exist included Mt Gox, Bitinstant, and Tradehill. People complain these days when BTC drops $500 bucks in an hour and trading platforms go on the fritz, but in Feb. 2012, Tradehill had to shut down because someone withdrew $100,000 from their service without warning.

Today, when you look at forum discussions on Reddit or Bitcointalk.org, people get really excited when they talk about obtaining a single BTC. In the summer of 2011, individuals did the same thing except they owned thousands of coins in contrast to owning just one. The creator of one particular thread says: “I own 5,200 bitcoins. How many bitcoins do you own?”

The discussion shows various members of the crypto community boasting about their wealth in digital currency. Amidst the forum conversation a Tennessean dubbed “KnightMB,” said he held 371,000 bitcoins and allegedly was the richest man in the bitcoin realm that year (it is now worth $3.8 billion today). KnightMB showed a picture of his QT client with the balance and people have talked about his stash for years. The individual was a miner and decided to brag about his wealth when everyone was in awe over the miner Artforz and his stash of coins.

The First Bitcoin ATM and ‘Bitcoin Bank’

In those days, things were far more interesting than today, when everyone makes a big deal about congressional leaders discussing BTC. Developers and nerds were building interesting gadgets to help bolster the nascent cryptoconomy at the time. While building a fusion reactor in New York, the inventor from Brooklyn Mark Suppes forged an automated teller machine from an old bank ATM and attached eBay-sourced parts, building one of the first crypto ATMs. No one knew what to think about the Bitcoin network and many respected and influential minds at the time were quite skeptical of it growing.

In early 2011, the well known columnist Tim B. Lee did not seem to like BTC, but by 2012 his Ars Technica bio disclosed that he owned some. In 2012, there was a lot of hype about BTC entering the mainstream when the business Bitcoin-Central was approved to operate under European financial laws. At the time, Bitcoin-Central became a Payment Services Provider (PSP) and was issued an International Bank ID number as well. The news was heralded as an announcement of “the first Bitcoin bank” as the business was equated with other payment processors such as Paypal and Worldpay.

“The more we see governments and banks being willing to deal with Bitcoin, the more comfortable a lot of organizations are going to be making the step forward themselves,” said Vitalik Buterin who was the technical editor at Bitcoin magazine back then. The France-based trading platform closed for six months shortly after the announcement and re-launched on Sep. 25, 2013. The platform now pales in comparison to the volumes of cryptocurrency swapped by today’s ‘Bitcoin banks‘ like Coinbase and Binance.

Remembering the Past

A lot has changed since the early days of Bitcoin and there are now more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies competing for the crown. Bitcoin has forked a few times as well since then and there are different versions seeking the same world domination or hyperbitcoinization. Using bitcoin for daily transactions was once seen by many to be an e-commerce revolution free from the state. Nowadays there are certain bitcoin enthusiasts begging for institutionalization and government approval.

In current times there are ‘bitcoin bugs’ acting just like the ‘gold bug’ Peter Schiff, which is a far cry from when bitcoiners debated the New York Times columnist and Keynesian economist Paul Krugman in the fall of 2011. Krugman called Bitcoin proponents ‘golden cyberfetters’ and the community tore his editorial to pieces. At the time, the online community preached about ending the fed and declared war on the central banking system by promoting the use of a counter-economic ‘plan B.’

Many people believe it’s good to re-live history through retrospectives and old stories so we can all learn from our past. It’s also helpful to see how much the system has changed and improved over the last ten years. There’s always something going on in the world of crypto every single day and forgetting the past is easy to do. A quick glimpse down memory lane shows the crypto ecosystem much different today than it was back then. In 2011, there were only 20,000-40,000 consistent BTC transactions a day and someone sending thousands of BTC to an unknown wallet was not out of the ordinary.

W ith a fee of just 0.000069%, the transaction illustrates once again how Bitcoin may be a better option for remittances than more traditional means.

Bitcoin Whale Moves 94,504 BTC

Whale Alert, a service that provides live tracking of large cryptocurrency transactions, posted the transaction on Twitter late Thursday evening.

???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? ???? 94,504 #BTC (1,018,147,922 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to unknown wallet Tx: https://t.co/VWb8slswa8 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) September 6, 2019

This particular transaction has garnered a great deal of attention from the crypto community for two reasons.

First, the 94,504 BTC transaction represents 0.52% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply and second, it incurred a fee of just 0.06534852 BTC, equal to $700.24 at the time of the transaction.

That amount might seem large to anyone used to sending small amounts of money, until you consider that the value of the transferred bitcoins was more than US$1.01 billion [AU$1.48 billion].

The fee ended up representing just 0.000069% of the total amount of BTC moved.

Speculation ran rampant as to who the sender could be, with some CryptoTwitter denizens suggesting that the funds were linked in some manner to Bakkt, the crypto asset platform created by NYSE parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).

Bakkt is expected to offer physically-backed Bitcoin futures contract to investors when it launches later this month.

Is Bitcoin really cheaper for sending remittances?

There are several different ways to transfer money around the world. What this transaction shows is that despite claims to the contrary, Bitcoin remains one of the cheapest – and fastest – ways to send funds compared to other solutions.

When you transfer funds using traditional means – e.g. bank wire or other fiat-based remittance service – it isn’t just the transfer fee you have to look at. There are also exchange rates, margins, and other hidden fees and costs to consider.

International remittance service TransferWise, for example, charges 0.36% in total fees on a $1 million transfer, which comes out to $3,628.73. Of that total, just $5.34 is the actual wire transfer fee – the rest is nebulously labeled as “Our fee”.

Presumably, the percentage charged would be less on a $1.01 billion transfer, but even if it was half that – 0.18% – the total fees charged would be more than $1.8 million.

And don’t expect to get that money right away. According to its online calculator, funds sent today “should arrive” by September 10.

By contrast, not only was the Bitcoin transaction fee more than 260,000% LESS than TransferWise, but the transfer was completed in just 17 minutes.

Lendingblock’s exchange provides a secure and liquid venue for lending and borrowing various crypto coins.

Institutional users will be able to borrow and lend popular digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. This can be done on loan terms of 1, 7, 14, and 30 days, with a minimum trade size of $100,000.

Loan management

Clients won’t have to hold their assets on Lendingblock’s exchange ahead of placing orders. Instead, Lendingblock manages the entire loan lifecycle throughout the term of the loan.

The firm ensures correct maintenance and sufficient collateral so that all loans are fully secured. Lendingblock also acts as a settlement agent throughout any transactions, with borrow and lend orders being matched automatically. Any rates are set automatically by supply and demand, providing a transparent view of current market rates at any given time.

Market analysis, accessible data, and price transparency

Lendingblock’s clients include a mix of trading houses, market makers, and crypto lending firms. As such, the new platform supports the broader needs of the market and all of its participants.

Borrowers and lenders can enter into fully collateralised crypto vs crypto lending agreements that benefit both parties. Lenders can earn incremental interest income and borrowers can use their own digital assets as collateral.

Key market infrastructure

With this new platform, Lendingblock is creating a wider support mechanism for the cryptocurrency industry. Steve Swain, CEO of Lendingblock, explains:

“We see the Lendingblock exchange as a key piece of market infrastructure that will provide efficiencies and support healthy markets in the crypto economy. We look forward to bringing the first institutional lending exchange to market and believe it will play an essential role in facilitating clients’ trading strategies and also in helping the crypto market infrastructure to mature.”

This support will also be embedded in Lendingblock’s approach to customer service, which will include a team that offers 24-hour support over the phone and through live chat. As the business and platform grows, it will expand its capabilities to meet further client demand.

That's why I'm sharing this essay from my colleague, Crypto Capital editor Eric Wade, in which he explains that the world of cryptos involves much more than just bitcoin...

If you've heard of cryptocurrencies... you know about bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the largest and most widely known cryptocurrency, accounting for around 65% of the total crypto market value. But it is just one of roughly 5,000 cryptos currently trading in the market. And more are being added every day.

Bitcoin is the original ""proof of concept"" cryptocurrency. It was the first one, released in 2009 by an individual (or group) known as Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin proved that it's possible to build, deploy, and support a fully decentralized and secure digital asset that doesn't rely on any centralized issuing authority. Bitcoin showed that a scarce digital asset (one that can't be copied) can be stored and transferred over the Internet.

If the Internet in the 1990s was about the transfer of information, blockchain and cryptos are about the secure transfer of value. The implications are mind-boggling.

The birth of bitcoin has paved the way for hundreds of other cryptos to flourish. However, as with all early stage industries, most early cryptos will fade away into obscurity.

In my Crypto Capital advisory, I'm focused on bringing my subscribers the ones that won't... and finding the ones that will double, rise 10-fold, or even 100-fold. But before you consider investing in cryptos, you must learn the basics about the crypto ecosystem...

Just like there are different types of stocks, there are many different types of cryptos. So when I refer to the entire crypto market, I'm talking about crypto assets.

I break these down into three sub-categories:

Cryptocurrencies Crypto protocols Crypto enterprises

Let's start at the top...

Bitcoin was specifically designed to be a secure, fully transparent platform for storing and moving digital value. That's it.

Since it will eventually have no inflation, bitcoin is like ""digital gold.""

But cryptocurrencies have very different characteristics and purposes. Some are more like businesses, some are like gambling services. Some provide the investor or token holder with some form of ""utility"" (like decentralized digital storage or identity verification).

At the moment, all crypto assets tend to get lumped into the ""cryptocurrency"" bucket. But that's wildly misleading...

The majority of ""cryptocurrencies"" aren't currencies at all. The yen, dollar, pound, euro – these are currencies. They are mediums of exchange. Bitcoin is a digital currency, and there are a handful of other competing digital currencies.

But the entire crypto market involves much more than these digital currencies...

When you go to a website, the website address doesn't start with ""www."" It starts with ""http"" or ""https.""

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (""HTTP"") is the foundation for data communication on the web. It's a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and the actions web servers and Internet browsers should take.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (""SMTP"") is the foundation upon which billions of e-mails are sent daily around the world.

A handful of other protocols exist, but these are the backbone the Internet was built on. They are the fundamental infrastructure, the roads, the water pipes, and the electricity pylons of our global digital economy.

They're worth trillions of dollars, but you can't invest in HTTP or SMTP. When it comes to the existing Internet ecosystem, all the investible ""value"" has been captured by the likes of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and other Internet-based businesses.

But there's a new Internet backbone being created right now, and it's being built on blockchains. These crypto protocols are what the next blockchain version of Amazon will be built on. And you can invest in these protocols.

Joel Monégro from technology investment company Union Square Ventures coined the term ""fat protocols"" to describe the backbone of a new blockchain-based Internet. You can buy into these fat protocols using their tokens, and the ones that succeed will be worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars.

Blockchain technology and crypto protocols have led to new businesses being built and distributed to investors as crypto assets. These kinds of crypto enterprise tokens provide investors exposure to that particular business.

That exposure could be in the form of utility. For example, holders of a decentralized version of digital storage company Dropbox might have a certain amount of storage depending on how many tokens they hold. And if they don't use all their allocated storage, maybe they could rent it to someone else for some bitcoin.

Or the exposure provided by the token could be more like an interest in the business.

(Note: The regulatory and legal framework behind how these kinds of tokens are distributed and structured is extremely important and will vary on a case-by-case basis. You do not want to buy anything that could potentially be labeled a security by regulators.)

I'll use a hypothetical example here... Let's call it ""Bettingcoin.""

Let's say the team behind Bettingcoin decided to build a global casino platform on blockchain.

They decide to create 1 million Bettingcoins and sell 900,000 of them (90%) to the public in return for some bitcoin to build, launch, and market the platform. They do this in an initial coin offering (""ICO"") or initial exchange offering (""IEO"").

These Bettingcoins give the holders an economic interest in the Bettingcoin business.

The Bettingcoin platform takes a small commission on all the bets on their platform (known as a ""rake""), and then every month, it distributes a portion of that out (like a dividend) to the Bettingcoin token holders.

Bettingcoin isn't a digital currency – it's a stake in an underlying business.

So why do this on the blockchain?

By building the application on one of the crypto protocols, Bettingcoin can...

Prove that its games are fair. If you play online blackjack with a regular online casino, you have no way of knowing if it's fair or not. Bettingcoin's games are open-source, so anyone can audit the code to see the cards are being dealt fairly.

Provide complete transparency. All token holders can see how much rake is being generated since the blockchain captures everything. You don't need an auditor for the business because everything is on the blockchain.

Become fully decentralized. Once the company is up and running, a portion of the monthly rake can be allocated to token holders who ""bid"" to help improve the platform. For example, a young programmer enters into a contract to build another casino game for the platform in return for some Bettingcoin. This way, there's no corporate structure. It's just a decentralized application that exists on the Internet, run by its own community and outside of any jurisdiction.

In short, the term ""cryptocurrency"" can be confusing. Most cryptos are not currencies. The term could mean crypto assets, cryptocurrencies, crypto protocols, or crypto enterprises.

The crypto revolution is just getting started... But in the end, entire industries will be upended – and the investment opportunities will be as large as those during the dawn of the Internet era.

The gains could be bigger than any asset class on earth... And they are within your reach right now. But before you get started, it's important to know the different types of investments you can make in the space.

Good investing,

He said that cyber security issues are likely to deter central banks from releasing their own digital currency. However, reports suggest that China might launch its digital currency as early as Nov. 11. If the Chinese digital currency becomes a success, it will force other central banks to launch their own to keep up with the competition.

There are several important events lined up in the next few months that are likely to be positive for cryptocurrencies. The first such event is the launch of Bakkt futures later this month. We expect volatility to pick up just before the launch and remain high for the first few days as both bulls and bears attempt to establish their supremacy. Let’s study the charts to locate the critical levels, which will confirm the resumption of the uptrend.

XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) was the best performer among major cryptocurrencies by a wide margin. It has rallied close to 15% in the past seven days. Does this rise indicate the start of a new uptrend or is this just another pullback that will be sold into? Let’s analyze its chart.

The XMR/USD pair has formed a descending wedge pattern. If the price breaks out of the wedge, it can move up to $97.9733 and above it to $120. Therefore, aggressive traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the wedge and keep a stop loss of $65.

Contrary to our assumption, if the price fails to sustain above the wedge, bears will again try to break down below it. Such a move will be a huge negative and can result in a fall to $40. Though there is minor support at $60, we expect it to be broken.

In the short term, both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which points to consolidation.

EOS/USD

EOS is the second-best performer and has risen over 10% in the past seven days. Is this a dead cat bounce or the start of a sustainable rally? Let's analyze its chart.

The EOS/USD pair is currently correcting in a descending channel. The 20-week EMA is sloping down gradually and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand.

However, bulls are defending the support at $3.1534. Though this level has been tested thrice since early March of this year, the bears have not been able to break below it. If bulls can propel the pair above the descending channel, it will be a positive sign. The next level to watch on the upside is $4.8719. Both moving averages are located just below this resistance. Hence, a breakout of $4.8719 will indicate the start of a new uptrend and can be purchased with stops below recent lows. The target objective will be a move back to $9 in the medium term.

BCH/USD

The second-largest fantasy sports service Fanduel has added support for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for members to top up their accounts. One of the world's biggest Bitcoin Cash conferences was held in Townsville, Australia. The town has several outlets that support digital currency payments, which shows increased crypto adoption. On the fundamental front, a lead developer of Bitcoin Cash said that the network was unable to process large blocks of transactions having a size of two megabytes or larger.

The BCH/USD pair is attempting to bounce off the neckline of the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. This shows that bulls are defending this support level. However, unless they propel the price above the right shoulder at $360, we anticipate bears to again attempt a break below the neckline. If the pair plummets below the neckline, it will complete the bearish H&S pattern, which can drag the price to $105.

On the other hand, if bulls push the price above $360, it is likely to pick up momentum and rise to $515.35. A breakout of this level will invalidate the bearish pattern, which is a bullish sign. Traders can initiate long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $360 with stops below the neckline.

BTC/USD

The dominance of Bitcoin (BTC) has remained close to the 70% mark in the past week. This steady rise in Bitcoin’s dominance has left most altcoins struggling. Cantering Clark, a hedge fund manager and co-founder of Blockroots, believes that altcoin rally will start after Bitcoin breaks out to new highs or if its dominance drops below 40%. However, with the launch of Bakkt nearing, the spotlight is likely to remain on Bitcoin for the next few weeks. A recent event that caught the eye was a mystery transaction of 94,504 BTC. This made the recipient’s wallet the richest Bitcoin address that does not belong to an exchange. Will Bitcoin volatility increase in the next few days? What are the critical levels to watch on the upside and downside? Let’s look at the chart.

We like the sharp bounce in the BTC/USD pair from the trendline of the symmetrical triangle. This shows accumulation by bulls when the pair dips to the strong support of $9,080. The cryptocurrency can now rise to the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle. A breakout of the triangle will be a positive sign that has a target objective of $15,376.96. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the downtrend line and keep a stop loss of $9,000. The up-sloping moving averages and RSI above 50 show that bulls hold the advantage.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price reverses direction from current levels or the downtrend line of the triangle and plummets below $9,080. Such a move will dampen sentiment and can result in a fall to the $7,451.63–$7,337.78 support zone. A breakdown of this zone will reduce the probability of a new high in 2019.

DASH/USD

Dash (DASH) has partnered with IQ CashNow, which specializes in cryptocurrency ATMs. This move will add over 1,000 additional merchants who accept Dash and integrate over 250 additional ATMs. The Dash Investment Foundation plans to start investing on behalf of the Dash network. While the fundamentals look good, what does the chart project? Let’s take a look.

In the last week of August, the DASH/USD pair dipped below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally, which is a bearish sign. Usually, this is followed by a complete 100% retracement, which in this case will be a fall to $58.49. A breakdown to new yearly lows will be a huge negative.

Currently, bulls are attempting a pullback, which will face resistance at the previous support turned resistance of $95.4264. Above this level, the next resistance will be at the downsloping moving averages. Due to weakness in the cryptocurrency, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.

The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.",,https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/exclusive-shapeshift-boss-erik-voorhees-says-bitcoin-hits-20000-year-end-2020-next-bubble-cycle-as-he-takes-on-coinbase/,"Gary McFarlane, cryptocurrency analyst at interactive investor, interviews crypto entrepreneur and investor and ShapeShift founder/CEO Erik Voorhees. Turns out he’s a skeptic when it comes to Libra but thinks something will get out the door, is disappointed by bitcoin maximalism myopia, bullish on BTC price and laser-focused on fixing self-custody with the company’s new platform.

The innovative exchange’s chief is on a mission to bring rock-solid “self-custody” solutions to the independently minded crypto masses and is targeting Coinbase as ShapeShift’s main competitor.

The non-custodial digital asset exchange is a supporter of the Foundation for Interwallet Operability protocol that’s hoping to become established as the usability layer standard for crypto. Not surprisingly then, Voorhees has plenty to say about custody.

For those who are not familiar with the venue, ShapeShift made its name by offering instant transactions without requiring users to create an account. Plug in your hardware wallet and a way you go. The ‘no account’ part changed last year with the introduction of a so-called membership model in which “basic personal information” is now required of customers.

However, in the light of the global Financial Action Task Force-inspired regulations coming down the pipe, the ShapeShift tweak was probably a necessary and timely move by management, although unpopular with customers. Voorhees said last month that implementing KYC had ”gutted” the exchange’s customer base and badly hurt trading volumes.

In perhaps a sign of the times as the US market becomes even more central, in another takeaway Voorhees reveals that the number of US customers in its user base had risen “over time” to 50% from 35%.

Voorhees also speaks out against bitcoin maximalism and in favour of altcoin “diversity”, welcoming “experimentation”; he thinks there are five to 10 altcoin contenders for gaining traction.

Erik had a lot more to share. Read the full exclusive interview below.

ShapeShift wants to take on the custody kings? Why should crypto users and investors care?

If the crypto revolution simply brings everyone’s wealth back into the control of centralized parties, then it wasn’t much of a revolution.

Crypto is about financial sovereignty, first and foremost, and while there will always be a place for custodial services, we intend to build the best self-custody option for the masses.

Libra has shaken things up even if it doesn’t launch as originally envisaged. What are the implications of Facebook’s crypto entry for Big Tech and in turn the crypto landscape? Will governments ever allow competition to sovereign money to take hold?

Libra hit the scene like a comet from outer space. Everyone knew they were working on something, but when the details finally emerged it was clear they were creating a supra-national currency, rather than just a 1:1 USD pegged asset. This was brave of them, and got them tons of antagonism from the governments. Government is not happy to have competition in currency, and whether it’s coming from Bitcoin or Libra (and likely both), the world is going to be better for it.

I’m skeptical that Facebook will be able to launch Libra in its current form, and fear they will capitulate, water it down, and release a 1:1 USD pegged asset with little innovation behind it. But we will see!

On Twitter you recently said “embrace the diversity” when criticising those referred to as bitcoin maximalists. Altcoins are still in crypto winter by the look of it – when will the spring come and are there any projects that stand out from the crowd?

I find it really sad and ironic that Bitcoin Maximalists, who are allegedly in favor of decentralization, advocate for a world with only one monolithic blockchain. That is the opposite of decentralization. A world of many blockchains, many digital assets, and many varying use cases, is a more diverse and dynamic foundation on which to build the future of finance, rather than a monoculture project.

I remain extremely bullish on Bitcoin and it’s obviously the most important blockchain by far, but a world in which the only crypto is Bitcoin is a poorer world. I’d rather avoid endorsing other specific projects, but there are at least 5-10 other than Bitcoin which are worth attention. 95-99% of the alts may be totally stupid, but it only takes one valuable project beyond Bitcoin to defeat the Maximalist argument.

ShapeShift doesn’t do custody, the owner of the crypto asset is solely responsible. But isn’t the perceived complexity of using a hardware wallet one of the many things that has to be addressed as part of the wider usability drive to spur adoption?

Hardware wallets are not for everyone, but they remain the best combination of relative ease of use and significant safety.

Our goal with the new ShapeShift platform was to provide a software interface for hardware wallets that was indeed superior to anything else out there, and which would improve UX for the average person. But, ultimately, we can’t and shouldn’t expect hardware to be the solution to all people all the time. Later version of our platform will support non-hardware key storage options, but always the principle of self-custody will be maintained.

When is Ledger support coming to ShapeShift?

This year.

Can you say a little about the composition of your customer base and its geographical spread?

We are about 50% US customers, and then a long tail of dozens of other countries. Interestingly, we used to be only about 35% US, but it has steadily gained share over time.

Who do you see as the main competitors to ShapeShift outside of the “custodial” exchanges? DEXs, other atomic swap-based systems such as Changelly?

It’s important to distinguish between competitors of the classic ShapeShift.io exchange, or the new ShapeShift.com platform. Changelly and DEX’s were competitors of the old, but don’t offer what the new platform provides, which is a more holistic self-custody crypto experience.

Strategically, we are generally positioning ourselves now as a self-custody alternative to Coinbase; an impressive and highly important crypto company and worthy competitor.

Can bitcoin afford to rest on its “digital gold” laurels and forget about innovating to deliver the “electronic cash” of Satoshi’s whitepaper. Can scaling ever be adequately addressed and does it matter?

This is unclear. Bitcoin has demonstrated that it doesn’t really need to be at all popular for retail payments in order to be valuable thus far. However, it is still early in the process, and over 10 or 20 years it’s entirely possible that a different coin could still outcompete Bitcoin as the most valuable digital asset.

I think the odds of that are less than 50%, but it’d be foolish to assume Bitcoin has a guaranteed 1st place just because it always has in the past. I’m of the opinion that any specific blockchain cannot be optimized for all use-cases, because design tradeoffs occur. For this reason, multiple (and perhaps many) blockchains will exist long term and will dominate different applications. Money is extremely important, but it is not the only good that crypto assets are effective for.

Tokenization and stablecoins are growing in importance. Is this part of the necessary development process on a 10-year view say or a blind alley that blunts the progress towards mass adoption of a truly distributed and non-censorable value transfer protocol?

I think stablecoins are valuable and important, both the centralized fiat proxy kind (like Tether or USDC), and the algorithmic kind (like DAI). Not every asset must or should be “100% decentralized.” Decentralization is a gradient, and optimizing for decentralization (as Bitcoin has done) comes at the expense of other attributes. A crypto ecosystem of many assets is healthier and more productive, so I love all the experimentation happening (even if much or most of it fails long term).

What would you say have been the key factors driving the bitcoin price higher since the trough of the bear market last year?

Bitcoin has thus far operated on fairly clear and relatively predictable market cycles. As it grows to take over the world, this phenomenon will continue for a while. Asking why the price has risen this year is a little like asking why Autumn follows Summer.

How will Bakkt physically settled bitcoin futures impact the crypto space?

I actually have no idea! Generally the more developed the crypto ecosystem becomes, the better, and I’m curious to see this new instrument become available. We’ve come so far since I first got involved in 2011; it’s amazing to watch.

Where will the bitcoin price be by year end and do you expect a halving boost in 2020?

I think we’ll be over $20k by year end, and 2020 will be the next bubble cycle (regardless of halving). However, I make lots of price predictions because it’s fun, and I’m usually wrong. Crypto is a long term project, and always extremely speculative. Everyone should own some, and they should assume it’ll go to zero. When they’re comfortable with that, then they’re ready.",2019-09-08 10:28:44+03:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/you-can-buy-a-dream-car-with-bitcoin-cash-at-autocoincars-com/,"You Can Buy a Dream Car With Bitcoin Cash at Autocoincars.com

Buying a new car is always a thrill. Purchasing a luxury vehicle, a roadster or a classic even more so. But such an enjoyable acquisition is usually accompanied by time consuming formalities. When all you want is to sit behind the wheel as soon as possible, these additional steps can be a nuisance for most people. Finding a dream car you can buy with cryptocurrency will certainly save you some time and effort, especially when cross-border payments are involved. You can now do that with BCH on Autocoincars.com, a platform that works with leading supercar dealers.

Purchasing a Supercar With BCH Is Easy

Browsing through car ads can be a pleasure and a curse. It takes time to find the right model and make that suits your taste and needs. Multiple websites nowadays provide car buyers with a plethora of offers. However, if you are not only a petrolhead but also a crypto enthusiast, there aren’t too many platforms with a good choice of vehicles you can purchase with digital coins.

Autocoincars.com is a website where customers can find a rich choice of high-end models, from comfortable and practical SUVs, to fancy sports cars and even collectible classics with detailed service history. And the best part is that all of them can be bought with bitcoin cash (BCH). The company works together with Bitcoin.com to expand the use of peer-to-peer electronic cash.

The precious automobiles are sold by established U.K. dealers and can be delivered to buyers in other countries as well. One of the platform’s main partners, Redlinespecialistcars.co.uk, is the largest independent supercar dealer in Britain. They cooperate to promote crypto and have already made numerous sales to clients opting to pay with digital assets. David White, Auto Coin Cars chief operating officer, told news.Bitcoin.com:

We transacted a Lamborghini from the U.K. to Germany last month, a $300k car. One younger crypto user bought his mother a $70,000 Range Rover for her birthday surprise – all in crypto. And last week we had an enquiry from Sydney, Australia for a £2 million Aston Martin. Exciting times.

The portal bets on bitcoin cash, offering clients the opportunity to purchase Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Aston Martins, and many more quality brands with BCH. All of its ads have the asking price displayed in a range of fiat currencies such as U.S. dollar, British pound, euro, and UAE dirham. But Autocoincars.com specifically targets cryptocurrency users who want to buy a car with bitcoin and their pricelist starts with a price quote in bitcoin cash. Customers can also pay with the platform’s own token, autocoin.

Crypto users who want to buy cars do not search Autotrader, Pistonheads, Motors, or any other traditional portal, the website explains. “Why would they? They would struggle to find a car dealer that accepts bitcoin on there. Instead, they search Google for ‘buy car with bitcoin’ or one of the many hundreds of search terms for which Autocoincars.com is ranked number 1 and page 1. They select a car, contact the dealer and agree [to] a deal in the usual way. They then pay for the car with bitcoin or other crypto through our regulated exchange and we pay the dealer prior to the car being delivered.”

Auto Coin Cars’ team further notes that there are over 3 million cryptocurrency wallets in the U.K. alone, which illustrates the growth potential for this market in the future. A study conducted this year by Technavio projects that the global luxury vehicle market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 12%, or approximately 8,000 units within five years.

Accepting crypto payments opens up a whole new area of business that was until recently unavailable to car dealers. Millions of people around the world now own cryptocurrency and many would readily use their coins to purchase a new car thanks to the speed and security crypto transactions bring to the table.

At the same time, car dealers can now easily accept cryptocurrency and convert it immediately into fiat money if they want to do that, safely and securely. They can use the website’s Sell Now section to register with the platform, providing more information about themselves and uploading their ads to reach millions of crypto users globally.

North London-based Auto Coin Cars employs experienced crypto professionals and automotive specialists who have provided a simple answer to a supply and demand issue. Car buyers want to spend their crypto, while car dealers are not set up to accept it yet. Many of them realize the benefits of cryptocurrency payments once they try them.

Bitcoin cash, for instance, offers immediate and secure transactions at a very low cost, often less than a U.S. cent per transfer. And the funds are available almost as soon as the payment is made with no chargebacks or card fraud. Auto Coin Cars’ clients are typically high net worth individuals who can also take advantage of the privacy that comes with crypto payments and rely on an instant crypto-fiat exchange eliminating price fluctuations.

Some of Auto Coin Cars’ sports and performance vehicles are offered only to crypto users in closed auctions. These automobiles are the highest quality models supplied by the U.K.’s top car specialists. According to the platform, all of them are carefully selected, come with full service history and are in immaculate condition confirmed by independent reports. The first such auction will be held in late 2019. Potential buyers can register now and receive details about each month’s offerings, along with the terms and conditions of participation.

Auto Sales With Crypto Payments Are a Promising Market

The niche Auto Coin Cars operates within is likely to grow in the future. So is the popularity of crypto payments in general, especially now when many expect to see a new crisis in the traditional financial system as early as next year. At this point in time, the platform doesn’t have too many competitors. Another website selling supercars and classics for cryptocurrency is Bitcars.eu. Most of the listed vehicles are in Europe, but the platform can deliver them to a specific location, arranging transportation and customs clearance. Bitcars accepts bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) through the payment processor Bitpay as well as XMR, ETH, LTC, DOGE and DCR via Globee.

Buysellcarwithbitcoin.com is a platform allowing users to publish ads for vehicles on sale or pick a listed car that can be bought with bitcoin. The website connects buyers and sellers who want to finalize their deal in cryptocurrency. Just like Auto Coin Cars, Buysellcarwithbitcoin allows you to select a location near you, choose a brand, set a minimum and maximum price, and search by keywords. The portal also publishes ads for auto accessories such as car audio systems, view cameras, rims, and many more. Dealers selling high-end vehicles for crypto also include Post Oak Motor Cars, a Bentley, Bugatti and Rolls-Royce dealer in Houston, and Hollywood-based Jem Motor Corp.

If you buy a second hand car whose interior needs refreshing and detailing, you can always use the services of Cockpitdekor.com where you can order trim parts for you dashboard, center console and doors. The best thing is that you can buy them with bitcoin cash. Cockpitdekor promotes the benefits of paying with cryptocurrency. The company is based in the U.K. and Slovakia, but its customization kits are sold globally. And in Venezuela, a country where cryptocurrencies have been gaining ground on the backdrop of an unstable and highly inflated national fiat, auto insurance plans can now be purchased with bitcoin cash, as news.Bitcoin.com recently reported.

Payments using decentralized digital currencies are likely to spread further in this and other industries. If you want to purchase bitcoin cash and other major cryptocurrencies you can do that at buy.Bitcoin.com. To freely trade your crypto assets, visit our noncustodial, peer-to-peer marketplace local.Bitcoin.com, which already has thousands of users from around the world.

On Friday, crypto analytics site Messari and data analyst Zack Voell shared a controversial chart called “Bitcoin Cash versus Lightning,” which claims to display a comparison of activity for both networks. Voell contended that the Lightning Network was growing at a faster rate than the scaling solution BCH has to offer. The way the chart was portrayed and the written critique was contentious, to say the least, and crypto supporters accused the Messari analyst of being biased and “cherry picking” data.

Messari Analyst Accused of Cherry Picking Data

Zack Voell, a data analyst from Messari, stands accused of producing biased material for the website that claims to “promote transparency and smarter decision-making in the cryptoasset community.” On Sep. 6, Voell tweeted a chart that claimed to show the comparative growth and use of BCH versus the Lightning Network. A quick glimpse at the chart shared by Voell makes it look like the Lightning Network has seen exponential growth while the BCH side is dreary. According to the author, “[BCH] transaction count, traded volume, returns (denominated in Bitcoin), and active addresses all fell by double-digit percentages since September 2018.”

Bitcoin Cash versus Lightning YTD of comparative network activity seems to show one scaling solution growing significantly faster than the other. (Obviously, the comparison is imperfect, but these data are still telling.) https://t.co/Uvf5z2WoBW pic.twitter.com/qzjFdYkPSC — Peter Ryan (@_PeterRyan) September 7, 2019

Following Voell’s tweet, live stream host Collin Enstad laughed at the Messari analyst’s chart and asked: “Did you just cherry pick a stress test day from a year ago and then claim the transaction count is down over 90% — 12 months later?” During the first week of September 2018, BCH participants had multiple stress tests and the network saw millions of transactions per day on a few occasions that week. In fact, many BCH supporters believe the September stress tests proved that Bitcoin can scale, when miners processed 2.4 million transactions in one day and fees remained at $0.003-0.001 per transaction.

In response to Voell’s tweet and chart, the researcher from Ryan Research, Peter Ryan, asked the Messari analyst why he didn’t use year-to-date (YTD). Ryan further explained that looking at the comparative growth and use of Bitcoin Cash versus Lightning is better with YTD metrics. “YTD of comparative network activity seems to show one scaling solution growing significantly faster than the other. (Obviously, the comparison is imperfect, but these data are still telling),” Ryan’s tweet said. Following the discussion on Twitter, news.Bitcoin.com spoke with Peter Ryan about Voell’s assessment of both networks.

A Discussion With Researcher Peter Ryan

News.Bitcoin.com (BC): What do you think about the recent chart Zack Voell from Messari shared yesterday?

Peter Ryan (PR): While it appeared to use valid data, the comparison was dubious in a few ways.

One, BCH and the Lightning Network (LN) are two different technologies with different metrics. This is a classic apples to oranges fallacy. For instance, there’s no way to measure the transaction count on the LN and no equivalent of “node capacity” on BCH.

Two, the choice of data was biased. It showed 12 months back to a stress test on the BCH network which could distort how one could view growth. This is why most analysis comes out quarterly or monthly because it provides an objective choice of dates rather than one that is arbitrary.

BC: Why do you think someone from a startup that’s supposed to share unbiased data concerning crypto networks and markets would share something like that?

I’m sure he would paint it as “just reporting the data,” but this is obviously a low-brow attempt to justify the fragile scaling narrative around the Lightning Network.

BC: Do you think the chart and report reflected poorly on Messari?

PR: Yes. It’s a shame that their tools for better data analysis get overshadowed by their team’s repeated demonstrations of bias. It’s possible that this bias could taint their quantitative reporting, although that hopefully seems unlikely. I’m more concerned about them leveraging the brand of an objective data provider to perform distorted punditry.

BC: You recently shared a chart of your own from Ryan Research can you tell us about the data stemming from this?

PR: It was more a lark than a chart. I was displeased with the sleight of hand by Zack, so I duplicated the exact same chart as his but changed only one parameter: the date.

My chart compared YTD instead of his 12-month version and showed a different picture. Bitcoin Cash actually performed better than Lightning. For instance, BCH’s transactions grew 691% compared to much lower growth figures from Lightning.

BC: Can you tell our readers a little about Ryan Research and how you got into researching cryptocurrency data?

PR: Ryan Research is a firm focused on analyzing complex subjects and communicating clear explanations.

Whether through data, like showing an objective analysis of supply forecasts on different bitcoins, or through more qualitative content, like a survey of thought leader commentaries from across the crypto industry.

I have a degree in economics from New York University and have worked as an analyst in various venture capital and startup contexts. More recently, I was the lead research analyst at Coindesk and assisted them in enhancing their cryptocurrency data research.

BC: If you were to compare BCH scaling data versus Lightning Network scaling data how do you see the two competing?

PR: It’s very difficult to make comparisons between the two, let alone any unique cryptocurrency. If I were to suggest a somewhat sufficient one, it might be Lightning Network Nodes vs. Bitcoin Cash Active Addresses as they are both used as rough proxies for users. As of today, BCH has about 40,000 active addresses compared to about 5,000 nodes on Lightning.

BC: Where do you recommend cryptocurrency enthusiasts find unbiased cryptocurrency network and market data?

PR: I recommend Coinmetrics, Coingecko, Cryptocompare, Bitinfocharts, Coin Dance, and of course charts.Bitcoin.com. Always try to get to the raw numbers and avoid any “adjusted” or fancy metrics derived from biased calculations. However, you could avoid all that bean-counting agony and read Ryan Research, where we do it all for you.

A closer look at the balance of power in this global industry reveals how banks could manipulate, and even dominate, cryptocurrency in an unregulated market.

Central banks: the power brokers of currency

Central banks are the largest institutions in the FX market and hold reserves of their own fiat currency in addition to foreign currencies for trade and strategic purposes. By controlling domestic monetary and commercial banking policy, central banks exercise broad powers over short, mid, and long-term trends in the currency markets.

When announced by central banks, high-impact news such as interest rate adjustments and inflation reports have significant short-mid-term effects on price-action as they are priced in by market participants, and then go on to impact higher timeframe trends as consumers and businesses react accordingly.

Can central banks manipulate crypto?

Naturally, Bitcoin and other decentralized, fixed-supply cryptocurrencies exist as an antithesis to such a model of state-level control—famously derided by Satoshi Nakamoto in the creation of the Bitcoin’s genesis block with the comment “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”—operating outside the sphere of central banks, seemingly to their dismay.

Central banks initially pushed back with abhorrence at Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies, at the prospect of a monetary system outside their control, but seem to have turned their attention to other apparent threats in recent months after the announcement of Facebook’s Libra and corporate digital currencies.

While central banks cannot yet manipulate cryptocurrencies as they would their own fiat using interest rate adjustments and more nuanced tactics, they certainly have the means to create a system where they can influence price discovery in the crypto market.

Bitcoin as Reserve Currency 3.0

Through policy, central banks could incentivize their commercial underlings to realize Hal Finney’s “Bitcoin bank,” replicating the fractional-reserve banking system of today using BTC as reserve currency and effectively integrating it into the world of FX.

The first step may have already been taken towards Finney’s prophecy, banks using a form of “digital cash” redeemable for Bitcoin. The majority of central banks are reportedly intent on launching their own digital currencies, with China set to roll out its own as early as November. Indeed, these sovereign digital currencies could morph into the electronic cash envisaged by Finney if Bitcoin should usurp status from the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, and perhaps gold as an incumbent store of value.

In another scenario, China and other states that do not float their currencies freely on the FX market, but peg them to the U.S. Dollar or other strategic fiat currencies, could have an incentive to switch to BTC as reserve. Maintaining a pegged rate requires a vast sum of foreign currency to be held by the state—more than $3.1 trillion USD in China’s case—and can exacerbate inflation in the reserve currency and produce other undesirable side-effects.

Bitcoin, a deflationary, fixed-supply asset that cannot (easily) be weaponized through foreign central bank policy, may be a preferable peg as its capitalization expands sufficiently to stabilize the price.

Due to the loose regulatory environment of FX, however, the actions of central banks may not be required to give commercial banks significant leverage in the crypto market.

Currency regulation and the issue of sovereignty

The narrative of crypto as an easily manipulated, unpoliceable asset-class has existed since the inception of Bitcoin, often contrasted with the supposedly iron tight securities markets. It may seem ironic then that the market for fiat currency, which may be a more accurate equivalent to crypto, is all but unregulated.

FX is a global over-the-counter (OTC) market and as such has no international regulatory body to police trades. On the domestic level, spot FX, which accounts for more than 85 percent of all transactions, is unregulated in all major FX centers including the U.K., the U.S., and Switzerland. Only futures, swaps, and other non-spot transactions are regulated in these jurisdictions, as derivatives.

If banks are to handle crypto under similar terms—a likely scenario given the SEC’s declaring BTC and ETH as having non-security status—their role in FX must be understood.

How commercial banks dominate FX

A collection of banking giants including Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, UBS, and Citigroup are the top tier of traders in FX, making the market and accounting for more than 50 percent of all trading volume.

The banks generate profits on the bid-ask spreads they offer to institutional traders and corporations transacting FX, and also generate gains through their own trading programs. As the banks handle large, often multi-billion-dollar transactions for corporate clients that will push price in a certain direction, they can legally capitalize on proprietary information. In the securities market, this is an illegal practice known as ‘front-running.’

Thinkably, the banks could wield similar powers in crypto—particularly in the case that central banks granted them the ability to adulterate Bitcoin price discovery using fractional reserve systems. Yet a less far-fetched scenario may be unfolding.

Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and other top banks have made public their intention to become crypto custodians while investing in the custody market’s existing leaders. Once mature, BitGo and other established custodians could become prime acquisition targets for the banks—thinkably giving them access to the same proprietary information they enjoy in FX by facilitating commercial trades.

There is no clear timeline for the entrance of banks to the crypto market, however, and the very subject has been rife with misdirection and obfuscation.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon seemed to become crypto’s poster boy for Wall Street’s time-honored brand of misdirection after his on-and-off blasting of Bitcoin as a “fraud” and “scam,” months before his firm declared BTC had “intrinsic value” and unveiled their own cryptocurrency. Not too long after Bitcoin made its famed rally of Q4 2017 and the coin became a household name, however, the banks started to lay a few of their cards on the table.

Goldman Sachs, a Wall Street stalwart as the second-most profitable bank in the world, led the pack in May 2018 when it hinted at plans to launch a Bitcoin trading desk, and a month later admitted it had been trading BTC futures on behalf of clients. Later in August after the confirmation of a Bitcoin bear market, the banking giant said it had shelved its own trading plans due to regulatory uncertainty. Few disclosures have been made by banks since.

The dark side of the market

The largest banks may not only dominate FX by capitalizing on privileged information in what some would see as a regulatory no-man’s-land, but for more nefarious reasons. The top banks have been hit with a number of high-profile charges and lawsuits for collusion, price-rigging, and many of the various forms of skullduggery one can commit in the currency market. Examples abound, and yet no regulator has to date shuttered a bank for manipulation in FX.

Perhaps most infamously, in 2012 it came to light that for over a decade Barclays, UBS, and a number of the top banks had been manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)—widely considered the world’s most important financial benchmark tied to hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of assets—to benefit their derivatives traders.

In late 2018, a group of institutional investors including BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, came to a settlement agreement worth more than $2 billion with 15 of the top banks after alleging they had been colluding for over a decade to rig the FX market. The complaint stated:

“By colluding to manipulate FX prices, benchmarks, and bid/ask spreads, defendants restrained trade, decreased competition, and artificially increased prices, thereby injuring plaintiffs.”

If banks enter the crypto market in force and employ some of the tactics they have evidently used to dominate FX—legitimate or mischievous—heavy implications could be in store for the price discovery of cryptocurrency. Ultimately, both commercial and central banks would profit from placing fiat-style controls over crypto and subjecting the market to the same dynamics at play in FX.",2019-09-08 12:19:05+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-news-from-brazil-sept-28-in-review,"Brazil has seen a tumultuous week in the cryptocurrency industry. The tax agency announced that they are running out of funds, the Securities and Exchange Commision (CVM) claimed that Brazil is “broke,” the Central Bank of Brazil introduced a new instant payment system, and Cielo, Brazil's largest credit card operator, is now accepting Bitcoin and crypto.

Here is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph Brasil.

Brazilian tax agency is running out of money

Cointelegraph Brasil reported on Sept. 6 that Brazil's tax agency — the Department of Federal Revenue (RFB) — stated that it will run out of funds by Sept. 24. If by that date the Brazilian government does not unlock financial resources, the tax agency will terminate agreements with contractors, stop issuing individual taxpayer registry identification numbers and paying income tax refunds.

Cryptocurrency exchanges could also be affected as the requirement that they report all user data and transactions involves the use of an RFB system. Since the system will be shut down if the agency runs out of money, crypto exchanges would simultaneously be legally compelled but unable to comply with data reporting requirements.

Brazil is “broke” — prevents new investors from entering crypto market

A recent survey by the CVM shows that almost 70% of Brazilians have no means to deal with unforeseen financial events, and that only 9% can afford expenses for which they did not budget.

The survey further reveals that the dire financial situation of Brazilians may prevent new investors from entering cryptocurrency markets and stiffen the growth of the industry as the majority of the population is simply “broke,” according to the CVM.

Central Bank of Brazil announces instant payments system

The Central Bank of Brazil recently announced the development of a new instant payment system that will change how funds are sent within the country. Brazilian citizens will purportedly be able to send and receive money in seconds, instead of several hours and even days.

It is expected that the new payment system will prove a boon for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), as it will allow deposits and withdrawals from exchanges on weekends and outside business hours.

Major credit card operator now accepts Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments

Cielo, one of Brazil's largest credit card companies and point-of-sale (POS) system providers, is now accepting Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments on its POS terminals. A POS user must first create an account with partner networks Uzzo or Criptohub in order to accept crypto payments.



To accept a crypto payment, the POS generates a QR code to which the payer can send Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The firm notes that the payee does not receive the actual digital asset, but rather a cash conversion in their Cielo account.

Cielo may reportedly expand crypto payment capabilities to its mobile app CieloPay in October. Cielo is the biggest payment system company in Latin America and has more than 1.4 million points-of-sale across 5,500 municipalities in Brazil.

Brazilian radio show pokes fun at Bitcoin Bank Group

A local radio show, the Panic Program, poked fun at the Bitcoin Bank Group (GBB) on Sept. 3, because the group suspended the operation of its NegocieCoins and TemBTC exchanges which led to complaints from its disgruntled customers.

The exchange is reported to have more than 30,000 undocumented customers and is facing varying degrees of fraud charges. In August, the Brazilan courts issued search and seizure warrants against the owners of GBB.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-cash-and-drugs-crypto-use-grows-as-drug-trade-digitalizes,"From speculation about its inherent value to theories about it being the payment method of choice for criminals, cryptocurrency is having a tough time keeping a clean name. One of the most common accusations is that cryptocurrencies perpetuate the sale of illicit drugs, a view recently expressed by United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Cointelegraph takes a look at the impact of cryptocurrency on illegal drug sales and whether it should shoulder more of the blame than cash.

U.S. government clamps down

The watershed moment for the U.S. taking decisive action against illicit drugs being purchased with cryptocurrency happened in 2013, when FBI agents rushed into the San Francisco Public Library to arrest Ross Ulbricht, a man who played a central role in the digitalization of the international drug trade. Operating under the pseudonym ‘‘Dread Pirate Roberts,” Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the Silk Road — an anonymous, Amazon-like marketplace located on the darknet — which let users buy and sell anything, regardless of legality. Although the site listed weapons, stolen credit card details as well as legal products, illicit drugs were by far the most common listing. The Silk Road pioneered the use of Tor, the network software used to access the darknet, and Bitcoin (BTC) escrow to conceal purchaser and seller identities and their activity. Although U.S. agents had hoped the seizure of the Silk Road would curb darknet activity, the news site DeepDotWeb wrote that the bust was “the best advertising the darknet markets could have hoped for,” with a number of copycat sites popping up in subsequent years. In 2014, the FBI seized 27 darknet sites during Operation Onymous, a joint effort between the FBI and the European Union Intelligence Agency Europol to stamp out illicit markets. In 2019, darknet markets are still selling illicit drugs that can be purchased with cryptocurrency, but U.S. law enforcement continues to take a hardline approach, arresting a couple in California on Aug. 6 for selling drugs on the darknet in exchange for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Recent events seem to confirm the firm policy of U.S. government officials. Less than two weeks ago, the Department of the Treasury added multiple crypto addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals, or SDN, list under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.

The addresses are said to be associated with three Chinese citizens, all of whom are active Bitcoin users. One Litecoin (LTC) address was also included in the list.

The Kingpin Act serves to clamp down on transactions between international drug traffickers seeking to smuggle drugs into the U.S. and ban transactions between those traffickers and U.S. entities. The act also gives the government the ability to coordinate and investigate foreign traffickers, the names of whom are brought to the attention of the president, who ultimately decides whether or not to impose sanctions.

Such legislative measures have been established in response to the state of illicit drug consumption in the U.S.: The country is currently in the throes of a serious opioid epidemic, with a person in America dying every 16 minutes from an opioid overdose. The White House issued two advisories outlining its concern that fentanyl, along with other synthetic opioids, are being purchased using cryptocurrencies.

Intended to help financial institutions and digital payment platforms, the advisories named the cryptocurrencies most requested by sellers of illegal drugs:

“Individuals located in the United States search for fentanyl and identify potential websites that may provide the opportunity to purchase illicit drugs online. Foreign representatives will instruct the U.S.-based individual to send payments through CVC, such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, or Monero.”

In an act to clamp down on the online drug trade, the advisories urged financial institutions to come forward with any suspicious user data, including:

“Virtual currency wallet addresses, account information, transaction details (including [...] hash), relevant transaction history, available login information (including IP addresses), information obtained from analysis of the customer's public online profile and communications, mobile device information.”

Where are drugs bought with crypto?

According to Ciphertrace’s report on Anti-Money Laundering, or AML, almost all drugs sold on darknet marketplaces are purchased with cryptocurrencies. For the most part, “drug sales on the dark web” is a phrase that has become synonymous with “drugs purchased with cryptocurrencies.” The dark web is a part of the internet that is accessible via specialized network software that allows users to navigate anonymously while their activity is largely untraceable. Given the increased surveillance powers of governments — most notably in the U.S. following 9/11 — the dark web provides an environment that is attractive, lucrative and, for the most part, safe for illegal drug traffickers.

Professor Talis Putnins, co-author of an influential University of Technology Sydney report on cryptocurrency and illegal drugs, told Cointelegraph that cryptocurrencies have had a big impact on the way drugs are purchased:

“Cryptocurrencies have fundamentally transformed the way illegal drugs are bought and sold, shifting much of the activity from a cash-based, physical ‘on the street’ market to an online marketplace.The online illegal drugs trade needed two fundamental things to take off. One is an anonymous communications platform, which was provided by the darknet and underpinned by TOR (an anonymous communications protocol). And the second important piece was an anonymous or private way of making digital payments that was difficult to trace by authorities. That is the role that cryptocurrencies have played. Thus, they are an integral part of the online drugs trade.”

On the other hand, Europol spokesperson Jan Op Gen Oorth expressed the opinion that the transparent nature of cryptocurrency renders transactions easier to trace compared to those involving cash:

“Payment for drugs using cryptocurrencies naturally makes more sense when compared to, for example, bank transfers. On the other hand, most cryptocurrency transactions are far better traceable due to their inherently transparent nature than cash.”

How widespread is cryptocurrency in illegal drug sales?

By virtue of their unaccountable nature, it is hard to estimate the exact market share of cryptocurrencies in illicit trade. The University of Technology Sydney report estimates that around 46% of illegal activity per year is associated with Bitcoin. While it is fair to note that this figure does not represent illegal drug sales alone, the report found that Bitcoin is the most commonly used cryptocurrency for purchasing drugs on the darknet. Putnins also noted to Cointelegraph that, although the use of Bitcoin for illegal purposes has increased, legal transactions using the cryptocurrency are also on the rise:

“What our research shows is that the dollar value of illegal activity in Bitcoin has continued to rise, as has the number of Bitcoin users involved in illegal activity, those growth rates have recently been outpaced by the strong growth in legal users, largely speculators. As a result, the percentages or shares of Bitcoin activity that is involved in illegal activity have fallen in recent years. Therefore, while the online black market has continued to grow, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used for legitimate reasons.”

A joint report between Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) found that when compared with the annual retail value of the EU drug market, darknet sales volumes are still modest but have potential to grow. The 2019 Global Drugs Survey notes an all-time high of 27.1% of surveyed drug users obtained illegal substances for the first time via the darknet in the last 12 months, up from 19.9% the previous year, which highlights the trend of the increasing digitalization of drug trade.

The report states that over the last six years, there has been a year-on-year increase in the percentage of surveyed participants obtaining drugs on the darknet. In addition, 30% of respondents claimed that the range of drugs they use has increased, and a further 5% reported that they had never tried drugs before accessing them via the darknet. The increase in both darknet sales and wider drug usage among respondents indicates that the digitalization of the drug trade is making narcotics more accessible — thanks to anonymous buying and selling as well as untraceable payments using cryptocurrency.

Moreover, according to the Global Drugs Survey, the ready availability of drugs on the darknet that are purchasable using cryptocurrency has increased their use and made them more attractive to those considering first time use:

“Over one quarter of participants reporting darknet market use in the last 12 months began their use in the year 2018: that is, they were new recruits to the darknet. These data confirm that darknet markets continue to attract new participants and that they are an increasingly significant players in the sale of distribution of illicit and prescription medication.”

How does cryptocurrency compare to other payment methods for drugs?

Prior to the advent of cryptocurrencies, cash was largely considered to be the most anonymous means of carrying out illicit transactions, owing to the fact that it is largely untraceable. However, even as Bitcoin's popularity grows, cash still seems to retain its central role in facilitating criminal gains.

In its report, Europol notes that this happens for several reasons. The first of which is that cash is a tried-and-tested payment method that has been used for centuries. Consequently, well-established methods for laundering cash exist. Another advantage that cash has over its digital counterparts is the fact that it is equally as untraceable (with the exception of serial numbers) and anonymous while being easier to exchange.

Most — but not all — cryptocurrency exchanges and online wallet providers require at least some basic Know Your Customer, or KYC, procedures in order to confirm the identities of their customers. The Europol report states that exchanges are usually very cooperative when it comes to identifying bad actors. Cash, on the other hand, can be physically exchanged between strangers and laundered in any number of ways without information about those involved being made public.

A Ciphertrace report found that, while there is a variety of cryptocurrencies used on so-called dark markets, Bitcoin remains the coin of choice in 76% of transactions. This is perhaps unsurprising, considering Bitcoin is — by a considerable stretch — the most well-known and widely accepted cryptocurrency: Litecoin is reported as being used in only 7% of cases, while privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) are only cited as being used in 4% of transactions, contrary to popular belief.

How have cryptocurrencies changed the purchase of illegal drugs?

The most fundamental change that cryptocurrencies brought to the drug market is the ready availability of anonymous electronic payments. Beforehand, a drug trade would have to take place via traditional, offline networks where payments were made via a physical transfer of cash. This naturally restricts the accessibility of illegal drugs to established networks and exposes the entire supply chain and payment structure to a risk of interception by authorities. On the other hand, the anonymous digital payments made possible by cryptocurrencies are particularly attractive to drug dealers and play a role in creating an increasingly large and sophisticated network of dark marketplaces and “black e-commerce.”

According to Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, the benefits of anonymity for drug dealers can be limited by the ability to cash out their crypto profits:

“The challenge for drugs traffickers is how to cash-out the proceeds of their sales. Most cryptocurrency exchanges make use of cryptocurrency transaction monitoring tools such as Elliptic's, which use blockchain analysis to determine whether funds are coming from sources such as dark markets.”

Although Ciphertrace's report found that a very small share of darknet transactions involve privacy coins, Robinson believes that they are nonetheless an impediment to law enforcement’s ability to help victims of cybercrime, compared to cases that involve other cryptocurrencies:

“One trend we are seeing is the increased acceptance of privacy coins such as Monero on dark markets where narcotics are available to purchase. Most new markets now accept Monero payments, typically alongside Bitcoin. This represents a threat to law enforcement's ability to trace this kind of activity and bring those involved to justice.”

Robinson explained to Cointelegraph via email that while Monero use is increasing, he is surprised that it has not disrupted the overall popularity of Bitcoin in illegal trade:

“First, what has become apparent and is slightly unexpected is that the emergence of privacy coins has not overly impacted the widespread use of the less anonymous Bitcoin in illegal trade. The privacy coins offer many advantages to criminals, but it seems the ‘first mover advantage’ of Bitcoin makes it difficult to replace now that its adoption in dark markets has become widespread. Put simply, it is not the best cryptocurrency to use for crime, but nevertheless remains the most popular.”

Are cryptocurrencies the best payment option for drug dealers?

Anonymity is a fundamental characteristic of cryptocurrencies that has been both celebrated and criticized in equal measure ever since their invention. Nevertheless, people buying and selling drugs with cryptocurrency aren't as untraceable as they might wish. The blockchain records publicly accessible details about every transaction made from one address to another. Unless the user launders the transaction through a series of intermediary accounts, both the origin and destination of the transaction can easily be discovered. The addresses can then be linked to public records, as was confirmed by Robinson:

“Cryptocurrencies are far less anonymous and less private than many people in the drug trade might hope. The analytical methods that we have developed for the Bitcoin blockchain allow a lot of the illegal activity to be identified and monitored. Continued raids and crackdowns by law enforcement agencies also speak to the ability of authorities to track at least some of the illegal activity in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.”

Cryptocurrency is still a young technology with limited usage. Although it may make transactions more anonymous than conventional wire transfers, cashing out crypto that was previously used for illegal purposes remains a complicated and unsafe procedure. For these reasons, cryptocurrency is unlikely to fully replace cash as the currency of choice for illegal activity any time soon. While the view that cryptocurrency is just a payment system like any other may be more or less correct, its anonymity undeniably makes it more attractive to individuals looking to buy or sell illegal drugs. However, as technology advances and anonymous cryptocurrencies become more widely accepted, privacy coins have the potential to impact the structure and development of dark markets and the illicit drug trade in a significant way.",,,,,,,

“One sec. $10270.”

Two minutes later: “Sorry guys, that was an old order from Friday when skype wasn’t working.”

“I really think we should get off skype. Bad things could happen. Someone is going to make an expensive mistake.”

*****

A messaging exchange over a potential $1 million deal, between a European asset manager looking to sell bitcoin and broker Joel Fruhman, illustrates the casual and often chaotic nature of cryptocurrency dealmaking.

Trades involving hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars are routinely struck via brief chats on apps like Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat or Zoom, often with scant certainty over the identities of participants or the legal basis of agreements.

“We’d end up in a Zoom call with about five ‘introducers’ - we didn’t really know who any of them were,” said Fruhman, a physicist by training who started a cryptocurrency brokerage business with his brother Dan in their British hometown of Manchester in 2018.

“And who were we? What was our credibility?”

Over-the-counter (OTC) trading - buying and selling through a broker - is now beginning to change, however.

It is moving toward electronic automation as the cryptocurrency sector matures from the province of online enthusiasts to emerging financial assets drawing increasing mainstream interest, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen industry players show.

This is a fundamental shift, as messaging apps have for years been the predominant platforms.

It is a key front in attempts by cryptocurrency enthusiasts with roots in the traditional finance industry to drag into the mainstream a singular, largely unregulated sector born on the web a decade ago as a symbol of rebellion against the establishment and offering users near-anonymity.

OTC trading is favored by big investors like hedge funds because cryptocurrency exchanges often suffer from thin liquidity, and large buy and sell orders can move the market.

But the opaqueness of the messaging process and its impracticality for use on a large scale, plus the glitches that could cause the “expensive mistake” warned of by Fruhman, have left it fraught with risk.

Now, as spreads - the differences between bid and ask prices for immediate orders - tighten as liquidity in crypto markets grows, OTC brokers and market makers are seeking to move away from unsophisticated chats and offer quotes electronically, with automated execution and settlement.

“Things have shifted quite rapidly toward electronic trading,” said George Zarya, CEO of London-based cryptocurrency exchange BeQuant, which also runs an OTC desk and is planning to switch toward automation.

“Anything that is liquid – bitcoin or ethereum – these markets are going to go electronic. That’s a natural path that traditional markets have gone through.”

The changes are likely to appeal to larger investors using algorithms and high-frequency trading for whom split-second timings are important, according to the interviews with cryptocurrency OTC brokers, market makers and investors.

Alameda Research, a crypto trader based in California and Hong Kong, launched an almost entirely automated OTC desk around six months ago that is already seeing flows of $20 million-$30 million a day, said Ryan Salame, its Asia-Pacific head of OTC.

For Salame, the future of OTC trading is electronic, with prices for all but the smallest coins to be quoted electronically.

“This is just the next step how you stay more competitive. Each desk is trying to be more competitive and making better systems,” he said. “It’s just a by-product of spreads coming in so much that I can’t update in the chat fast enough to give people the pricing they’re expecting.”

‘CAN YOU SELL A FEW MILL?’

The Fruhman brothers, Joel aged 29 and Dan 28, built a contact book packed with bitcoin miners they met on internet forums and apps as they grew interested in the emerging technology.

Miners use computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, competing against others and earning rewards in the form of new digital coins. As recently as a few years ago, individual crypto enthusiasts could mine bitcoin from their bedrooms.

But many had a problem, the Fruhmans found: They were producing bitcoin faster than they could convert them to the cash they needed to clear the hefty electricity bills run up by their high-powered computing gear working overtime.

“We saw something very clear: A bunch of guys with a lot of bitcoin valued in USD, who had no idea how to turn that into money,” said Joel. “It started with one request, which was just one of these guys, our mate, who was like: ‘Can you sell a few mill?’”

Late last year, in an attempt to tap bigger investors and offer more sophisticated back-office services, the brothers swapped their contact book for a stake in a startup run by ex-financiers well-versed in the infrastructure of the financial system, from escrow accounts to settlement systems.

The startup, BCB Group, then based in London’s financial district, offered something the Fruhmans lacked: regular access to clients from mainstream finance willing and able to buy the regular supply of digital coin offered by their mining contacts.

“It’s not the stoned 22-year-old that we were dealing with a year and a half ago,” said Joel. “And it’s not the equity traders, the Goldman Sachs. They’re kind of in between - it’s growing from one into the other.”

TRADE BLOSSOMS IN BITCOIN BUBBLE

Global cryptocurrency trading volumes are highly erratic. Over the past year, bitcoin alone - by far the largest coin - has seen daily volumes of between $900 million and $3 billion, according to research firm Coin Metrics.

Brokers estimate the OTC market typically accounts for 10% to 30% of global volumes on any given day.

The OTC market blossomed as bitcoin’s value soared during its 2017 bubble. That was when miners, wealthy individual investors, hedge funds and companies earning revenue in crypto grew active in the market.

Now, said the industry players who spoke to Reuters, the market is seeing a new shift as the predominance of messaging apps wanes and the more sophisticated tools used in traditional markets like equities and bonds become increasingly common.

“Doing stuff over Skype and over these voice chats is not really scalable,” said Kevin Zhou, co-founder of San Francisco-based OTC desk Galois Capital.

The evolution is partly being driven by newer entrants to the sector, many of whom are tooled up with cutting-edge tech. Some, like Chicago-based Jump Trading, are from the traditional proprietary trading worlds. Others, such as Alameda Research, specialize in cryptocurrencies.

And the changes are popular with big investors.

“I prefer to use electronic because all our algorithms are fully automated,” said Andrea Leccese, president of Bluesky Capital in New York, an investment firm that often runs orders of $5 million-$10 million through OTC desks. “If we can send our quote electronically to the OTC broker, it’s much better for us.”

“It’s fair to say more or less half of OTC trading is going through technical innovation like making fully electronic platform, and that’s even better on our side.”

Cryptocurrency regulation is patchy across the world, with curbs on the illegal use of digital coins the priority, and the implications of increasing automation in OTC trading are unclear. But, some market players say, because the changes are likely to attract more mainstream investment they could be a factor in speeding up the introduction of the kind of securities rules seen in traditional markets.

MACHINE VS MAN

While increasing automation may be inevitable, many OTC desks are in a bind. Some clients are loath to ditch the personal relationships they have established with their brokers and the apps they use to communicate.

New York-based Genesis Global Trading sees around $1 billion a month in volume, CEO Michael Moro said. While that’s down from the $2 billion-$2.5 billion a month during bitcoin’s 2017 boom, volumes are now rising between 10% and 20% a month.

Genesis uses TradeBlock, a New York firm that provides tools for trading cryptocurrencies, to execute its deals - but can’t completely abandon messaging apps.

“We will give market color over (Skype), but the actual transactions are over TradeBlock,” Moro said. “When your clients that are buying $5, $10 million say, ‘Hey, let’s just chat on Skype’, to get them to change their behavior and say, ‘No, we don’t do Skype’, you end up creating a friction.”

For the Fruhman brothers, personal relationships will remain key.

A new weekly record was set last week in global corporate bond sales, with investors grabbing hold of around $140 billion in new bonds according to data from Dealogic. This occurs against a backdrop of negative yielding debt, and the meteoric rise in popularity of stablecoins and exchange-native tokens across the crypto space. The near ubiquitous presence of coins like USDT on major exchanges, and the still nascent wave of exchange tokens like Binance’s BNB, signal a new era of cryptocurrency trading and investment. What remains unclear, however, is what separates these coins from traditional, legacy systems of investment such as their corporate bond cousins, and what all the hubbub is really about.

The Good Ol’ Corporate Bond

Corporate bonds are a debt security a lot like government bonds, but with generally higher interest rates due to higher risk. An investor buys a corporate bond, receives regular interest payments until the bond matures, and at that time can claim the face value of the agreement. In short, it’s another way of financing debt, bonding the corporation to voluntary debt holders until bond maturity, when the par value must be paid to the investor.

Last week’s record investment spree in companies like Apple, Disney, and Coca-Cola is notable because companies are refinancing debt thanks to a surge in investment brought on by dismal corporate yields elsewhere, especially Japan and Europe. This is the first time Apple has borrowed through the bond market since 2017. In essence, they’re riding the waves created by sinking debt ships overseas. The situation with government bonds in many countries is also extremely bleak, with record negative yields being hit in some European countries.

Should a business fall flat on its face and default, bondholders are left holding the debt temporarily, or may take a hit if the company files bankruptcy and issues newer, less valuable bonds to pay back the bag holders. Further, if the economies where these negative yielding fixed income instruments are issued recover, investors in the current low interest market could take a big hit.

Stablecoins and Exchange Tokens

Stablecoins are designed to bring an element of security to cryptocurrency. They can be backed with fiat currencies, commodities, or other crypto tokens. The name itself says it all. Where other assets like bitcoin, ether, and monero experience significant volatility, these assets remain relatively stable as they are pegged to less tempestuous currencies or commodities. Coinbase’s USDC (U.S. Dollar Coin) is a model example. According to Coinbase:

Our mission is to build an open financial system for the world. As part of this mission, we want everyone to enjoy the stability of the world’s fiat currency, the US dollar. USD Coin allows unbanked and under-banked individuals in any country to hold a US dollar–backed asset with nothing more than a mobile phone.

Exchange tokens, on the other hand, are assets created by exchanges which afford their holders some exclusive in-house benefits. In the case of Binance’s BNB Coin, whose ICO helped to finance the creation of the Binance exchange itself, users get discounts when they use BNB to pay fees and can trade the token for other assets on the exchange. There are also buy back programs set up to occur periodically at which times holders can sell the coins back to Binance. Supply will be limited to 100 million BNB after buybacks and burning are complete.

Some of the major stablecoins dominating the market today include Tether (USDT), Trueusd (TUSD), Paxos (PAX), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI). Leading exchange tokens include Binance (BNB), Huobi (HT), and Kucoin (KCS).

So What’s the Difference?

Like corporate bonds, both stablecoins and exchange coins have a value dependent on the success of some external entity or asset. For example, should Binance run into major trouble, and become insolvent, the value of BNB will suffer right along with the company. Should the U.S. dollar plunge farther and farther into inflated devaluation, a USDC peg to the currency won’t provide as much security. For those paying attention to the global economy, these scenarios are not difficult to imagine.

With non-pegged, non-exchange assets like bitcoin, there is volatility. However, this volatility is more loosely correlated with external deterministic factor than these others. In this sense, a free market setting is ideal for something like bitcoin, as liquidity and supply and demand factors find their balance in such an environment not via mandate, but through organic transaction.

In an open market setting, tying an emergent asset to a pre-established asset might be foolish, as it could weigh down the potential for the new asset to develop, grow, and unfold as a useful, sound currency. Under the current monopolistic paradigm, however, where force is leveraged to ensure fiat such as the USD is used exclusively as a world reserve currency, stablecoins and pegged assets remain secure, resting on that very same artificial monopoly. In a nutshell, most stablecoins, exchange tokens and corporate bonds are tied to the devaluation trajectory of the world reserve currency, the U.S. dollar.

Questionable Intent

Returning to the above quoted statement from Coinbase’s USDC webpage, marketing stablecoins and exchange tokens as means by which to allow “unbanked and under-banked individuals in any country to hold a US dollar–backed asset with nothing more than a mobile phone” seems more than a bit deceptive.

For example, if an impoverished and unbanked family in India wishes to gain access to this “open financial system for the world” they may have to come up with “certain personal information including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, information regarding your bank account … network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers,” as per the Coinbase’s user agreement. The unbanked are somehow assumed have TINs, home addresses, government IDs and, yes, even bank accounts.

Further, although stablecoins like USDT are said to be backed by fiat reserves, there has been serious controversy calling these claims into question. Tether was put in the hot seat after the website was discovered silently replacing “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves … 1 USDT is always equivalent to 1 USD,” with the claim that the reserves now consist of “traditional currency and cash equivalents and … other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties.” When asked last week about this, co-founder William Quigley told Bloomberg:

Whether or not Tether was backed by a dollar or not, actually wouldn’t matter if everybody agreed to take Tether and to value it at a dollar themselves.

If it doesn’t matter whether a dollar-backed stablecoin is backed by a dollar, one is left to wonder about the purpose of even calling it a stablecoin. Some companies issuing corporate bonds have historically made similar questionable claims, and promises with fingers crossed. As with investors in these bad bonds, users of stablecoins and exchange tokens must put their faith in the company’s success and track record, and not in the currency or protocol alone.

Benefits of Bonds, Stablecoins, and Exchange Tokens

In any successful economy, tools like debt securities, pegged assets, and native rewards systems or in-house currencies can serve useful functions for business owners and value holders alike. Much like the SLP universe being built on the BCH blockchain currently, specialized financial tools give their holders unique flexibility and opportunities in moving throughout the ecosystem of their specific economy.

An oversight being made in the crypto space today, however, is to compare things like fiat-pegged stablecoins and exchange tokens in an apples to apples fashion with non-pegged, free market assets like bitcoin. While the USD reserve paradigm affects all markets, the critical difference between non-pegged, permissionless assets and corporate bonds, fiat stablecoins, and exchange-native tokens, is that ultimately the latter three are tied to businesses and pre-existing financial paradigms, where the former are their own entity, free to move and grow even in the absence of legacy banking systems, or a sudden corporate default.

Local broadcaster TV 2 reported on Sept. 8 that the victim was an individual in his 40s who had been in the public spotlight for having made his 100 million NOK ($11.2 million) fortune through his ten-year involvement in the crypto space.

“Lie down, or I’ll shoot”

According to TV 2, the attempted robbery occurred on May 14. The would-be robber is reported to have entered the victim’s housing block and rang directly at his private apartment. When he opened the door, the victim was allegedly confronted with the barrel of the suspect’s shotgun.

The indictment, drafted by the Oslo Attorney General’s Office, alleges that the suspect threatened his target, “Lie down, or I’ll shoot.”

Not a single shot was fired, however, as the victim managed to escape, throwing himself from his balcony onto the street below. It is reportedly unknown whether he was injured during the escape.

The defendant’s assistant attorney has refused to comment on the matter.

While details of the victim’s professional life are not reported, he is said to be the general manager and owner of the board at an unnamed business in the cryptocurrency sector.

TV 2 underscores that he came to public attention for his significant financial successes in cryptocurrency.

The suspect’s lawyer has said his client does not admit the criminal charges contained in the indictment but has declined to comment any further.

The court hearing is set for Oct. 17 and 18.

Schwab — the U.S.’ largest investment brokerage firm, with $3.2 trillion in assets under management — will not seek to offer direct trading of cryptocurrencies for the foreseeable future, according to a Sept. 7 report from RIABiz.

“Sleepwalking through innovation”

Schwab’s managing director for corporate communications, Rob Farmer, told reporters that cryptocurrency trading services are not being pursued by the firm at this time. He cautioned that “investors should view these currencies as a purely speculative instrument.”

Earlier this year, when asked whether the firm would seek to join the governance consortium for Facebook’s forthcoming Libra stablecoin, Schwab president Walt Bettinger had also played for time, stating, “let's answer that question out in the future a little bit.""

One critic of this approach — Tim Welsh, of California-based consultancy Nexus Strategy and president of Larkspur — has claimed that:

“He’ll never willingly upset the apple-cart, unless the market forces him to do so. Until [Schwab's] biggest advisors demand they do something, they will continue their sleepwalk through innovation.""

Other analysts such as Will Trout, from Boston-based consultancy Celent — anticipate that Schwab ""will be forced to move into space at some point, although most likely in a small way, custody of client assets or a stake in an exchange.""

Or take a wait and see approach?

Not everyone shares this critical view of the firm’s slow-burning strategy. Lex Sokolin — global co-head for financial technology at blockchain software firm ConsenSys — has said that ultimately, established investment giants “have the long-term advantage right now, because they can acquire for cheap.""

Aite Group financial technology analyst Gabriel Wang has noted that the new sector’s roughly $300 billion market cap amounts to less than 10% of Schwab’s $3.2 trillion in AUM and just 1% of the U.S. equities’ market size:

""The overall market size of cryptocurrencies, at this point, is still not big enough for firms like Schwab […] to justify the risks they will be taking […] It could be worth it for these firms to wait.”

Schwab’s 8,000 registered investment advisors (RIAs) custody $1.7 trillion in assets through Schwab Advisor Services — roughly equal to Pershing, TD Ameritrade and Fidelity combined, as RIABiz notes.

Schwab Chief Strategist remarked back in 2017 that Bitcoin is “kind of its own thing” and thus hard to predict due to its independence and non-correlation with the wider, traditional market.

An updated grade list by Weiss Ratings, the financial ratings agency that covers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, shows a number of top coins being downgraded last week, including the world’s number one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.

As previously reported, BTC was given its first A rating ever, an “A-“ rating and a “strong buy” recommendation, in early July this year after a price drop brought upon by a huge rally. In August, it lost that rating and was downgraded to “B+”. Well, now, a month later, it has been further downgraded from “B” to “B-“.

A plus or minus sign indicates the upper third or lower third of a grade range, respectively.

The previous downgrade occurred after the bitcoin market had sold off from the high levels seen in June, which back then coincided with the “A” rating, while this downgrade could relate to the drop in price in August.

The potential risk of a BTC investment is deemed “fair,” same as before, but the potential reward dropped further from good to “weak,” according to the agency. As a matter of fact, BTC’s overall risk/reward grade dropped from “C” to “D+”.

However, its technology / adoption grade is “A”, with the former graded as “good” and the latter as “excellent”.

In either case, BTC is not the only coin that was downgraded. For example, Binance coin, Ripple, Monero, and Iota have all been downgraded from “C+” to “C”. Furthermore, Stellar has been downgraded from “C” to “C-“, and EOS from “B-“ to “C+”, but NEO was upgraded from “C” to “C+”.

""Bear in mind that the Weiss Crypto Ratings reflect not only long-term, relatively stable factors such as technology and adoption, but also short-term, volatile factors such as investment risk and reward. Therefore, they can change with some frequency,"" the agency explained.

A veteran Hong Kong regulator

Kwan — who previously covered enforcement and market supervision as part of her role as director of Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission — joined BitMEX last October.

She also served as managing director and head of regulatory compliance for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing for almost three years prior to accepting the BitMEX post. At the time, Kwan said that she believes an absence of robust regulation creates a lack of confidence among investors who might otherwise trade on cryptocurrency exchanges.

At publishing time, BitMEX is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by reported 24-hour trade volume, which is currently more than $3.4 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.

In mid-August, news broke that the United Kingdom’s Advertising Standards Authority upheld its complaint against a Bitcoin (BTC) advertisement from BitMEX. The ad in question featured a logarithmic graph showing the value of Bitcoin against the United States dollar over the past decade.

The custom-made containers intake cold air from the outside, filtered through lamellae mounted in the outer walls to cool down the machines in the process of crypto mining.

This development came after the company procured 4,475 ASIC miners in June from Cannan Creative and Bitmain.

“Already with our water-cooled container solution we have a revolutionary approach in place to mine Bitcoins sustainably and cost-effectively,” Moritz Jäger, chief technology officer of the German company, said. “The new air-cooled technology has been optimized for year-round cool locations.”

An environment-friendly approach to mine crypto

Unlike other miners, the German company is more focused on developing an efficient yet sustainable way of mining digital assets. Though headquartered in Frankfurt, the company’s mining sites are in Norway. According to the company, it operates a sustainable mining operation from green energy generated in the region.

With this new line of outdoor crypto-mining containers, Northern Bitcoin is planning to expand its operations in new locations across Scandinavia.

“With the new container variant, we are thus extending our option to open up new locations in Scandinavia for our Bitcoin mining,” Jäger added.

Banking, in the traditional sense of the term, has become a financial burden for account holders in regions where the era of subzero interest rates has already set in. European nations like Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, and Eurozone countries have been in negative territory for some time, and banks there have started passing the burden to corporate and private clients. However, businesses and savers don’t have to put up with losing money as the expanding banking services in the crypto space come with much better conditions, including positive interest rates.

With the number of cryptocurrency users growing constantly, the need for dedicated digital asset banking naturally increases too. Currently, companies specializing in this niche are actually offering better terms to their customers than traditional financial institutions are able to provide within the fiat system. Of course, it remains to be seen if they will maintain the competitive edge once demand for their services expands significantly.

Germany, the leading EU economy, is now witnessing a backlash against low and negative interest rates. Politicians from different factions have expressed support for an initiative to outlaw punitive interest on deposits of up to €100,000. With negative rates imposed on them by the European Central Bank, ordinary German savers feel like they are once again paying the bill for the rescue of the common currency, the euro. And the ECB is preparing for a new rate cut to an all-time low of -0.50% this month.

Cryptocurrencies are an alternative to fiat money in many respects and they are likely to attract more attention as clouds continue to gather over the world economy a decade after the global financial crisis and the birth of Bitcoin. And while some have warned crypto companies probably shouldn’t try to become the banks of a new financial era, there are also reasonable arguments that in many cases they can actually provide better services based on the strengths of decentralized digital currencies.

Berlin-headquartered Bitwala has established itself as a crypto banking and payment provider in Europe. Towards the end of last year, the company announced it’s offering customers bank accounts with Ibans through a partnership with Solarisbank, a licensed financial institution operating under the oversight of Bafin, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority of Germany. Deposits up to €100,000 will be protected by the German deposit guarantee scheme. The bank accounts come with a bitcoin wallet and a free debit Mastercard for payments and withdrawals, as news.Bitcoin.com reported.

Bitwala recently launched a bitcoin banking app for iOS and Android. The company explained that residents of the European Economic Area, all EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, can open a German bank account that comes with an integrated BTC wallet and start trading on their smartphones. The onboarding process is now fully integrated into the mobile application and opening a new account takes only a few minutes. The platform uses video identification and EEA residents are required to provide a valid national ID as well as a proof of address. In a statement issued in August, Bitwala Chief Technical Officer Benjamin Jones noted:

Once you have an account, you can seamlessly integrate your daily banking activities – whether in bitcoin or euro – into your everyday life.

Bitwala users can buy and sell cryptocurrency directly from their bank account with a low 1% fee charged per trade. The multi-signature wallet also allows them to transfer bitcoin on a peer-to-peer basis with friends and family. Transactions can be authorized by using biometrics. The company assures customers that in order to protect their coins in the Bitwala wallet, the private keys will remain in their hands.

BCH Users Can Now Spend Crypto via Apple Pay and Samsung Pay

Zeux is another fintech company that provides banking solutions for both digital and traditional currencies. It recently launched its new Zeux app for Android and iOS devices and introduced bitcoin cash into its ecosystem. The cryptocurrency is now listed on its mobile app which allows crypto users to pay with BCH via Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. The listing will help bring cryptocurrency into everyday life, Zeux explained in an announcement published on Medium.

The banking platform noted that Bitcoin Cash provides peer-to-peer electronic cash transfer at low fees and high security, thereby fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin. Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver welcomed Zeux’s effort in adding more utility to BCH holders and the whole community, describing it as a step in the right direction. “We’re glad that yet another crypto player sees the value in Zeux and not only what we can offer them, but what we can offer their customers. We look forward to what’s in store,” Zeux CEO Frank Zhou commented and stated:

BCH is one of the most prominent coins in the crypto space and working alongside their team brings us all closer to the mass adoption of cryptocurrency.

Earn up to 10% Interest on Your Bitcoin Savings

With the spread of decentralized digital assets and the problems fiat currencies are facing right now, often due to failed central bank policies, demand for traditional-style banking services in the crypto space will continue to grow. There’s a void to be filled and platforms such as Cred are doing exactly that. A partnership with Bitcoin.com aims to expand global lending and earning on cryptocurrency investments.

The cooperation allows Bitcoin.com customers to earn interest on their crypto holdings, up to 6% on bitcoin cash (BCH) and 10% on bitcoin core (BTC) invested with the Credearn product. The interest can be paid in either bitcoin cash, bitcoin core or Cred’s own LBA token. That provides clients with multiple interest options in a departure from earning interest only in fiat dollars. Over 4.6 million users of Bitcoin.com’s wallet can now take advantage of the crypto saving feature.

Similar to a bank, Cred uses the pledged assets to lend to various borrowers including retail investors and money managers. That’s on a fully collateralized and guaranteed basis as the platform works with trusted collateral agents and leading custody partners including Bitgo, Bittrex Enterprise and Ledger. The aim is to ensure the safety and security of the digital assets deposited by its customers.

Norwegian Bank Invests in Crypto Exchange

Traditional financial institutions have been tempted to get involved in the crypto space and provide services related to digital assets. Such is the case with Sparebanken Øst, a Norwegian savings bank, which recently announced it had bought a 16.3% stake in the Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) for 15 million Norwegian krone (approx. $1.67 million). The new trading platform is expected to start operations this month.

Admitting the high risk of the investment, Sparebanken Øst nevertheless noted in a press release its belief that “the ownership position in NBX is sound, based on the bank’s solidity and risk profile, and is responsible in relation to the bank’s needs and desire to take a leading role in technological developments in the industry.” The crypto exchange itself plans to also provide payment services to its customers. NBX will be fully compliant with Norwegian regulations applicable to its financial activities.

Mass adoption of cryptocurrency would mean that use of cryptocurrency would become ordinary course, and no longer a point of discussion, just as mere use or acceptance of fiat would not prompt headlines. Upon mass adoption, so-called “crypto-native” companies potentially may be viewed as “normal” technology companies and would be able to obtain bank accounts and traditional financing.

In order for us to say that mass adoption of crypto has begun, in my view, individuals need to be able to access, purchase, hold and use cryptocurrencies without having to understand what a digital asset is, just as nontechnically sophisticated people can use cell phones without understanding how they work.

Moon. Lambo. To the outside observer, this seems like an easy and sure way to get rich quick. They leave their jobs to become “professional crypto traders,” even before learning the basics of trading and managing risk. We all know how this story ends.

Being a trader in any market is hard — 95% of all traders fail, most within a few months. They generally go completely broke or perform far worse than simply investing a lump sum in a safe investment and leaving it to grow. Contrary to popular belief, the crypto market is the most difficult to trade for beginners for a number of reasons.

The casino never closes

The market is open 24/7, giving traders the feeling that they always have to be trading. This causes tremendous fatigue and FOMO (fear of missing out) for emotional traders. Nobody can effectively track a market that is perpetually available, and new traders find it difficult to step away. This often ruins both their personal lives and destroys their finances.

What fundamentals?

The crypto market lacks fundamentals, the cornerstone of trading legacy markets. When purchasing stock, a trader can review quarterly earnings, sales reports, the company’s road map and countless other barometers of success. More importantly, companies trading on the stock exchange are regulated and therefore transparent — you generally know what you are buying.

The strength of a team or project in crypto is nearly irrelevant for a trader’s purposes. Traders rely on technical analysis, which is hard to use properly for newcomers to the space.

I’m making money, so why is my Bitcoin balance down?

The interplay between Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins adds a complicated wrinkle. Alts are rarely safe to trade and finding opportunities requires tremendous patience and experience — both things that newer traders inherently lack. New traders often mistakenly gauge the success of their trades in the USD value of the coin, not realizing that leaving their capital parked in Bitcoin would have been a far more profitable (and far easier!) strategy. Trading legacy markets with fiat is straightforward — you either make or lose dollars.

How do I set up a stop loss and take profit order?

Legacy traders have the benefit of placing both stops losses and take profit orders, as well as trailing stops. Trades require less babysitting and management. In crypto, exchanges lack the full breadth of orders necessary to properly manage risk, especially in a market that never closes.

Experienced crypto traders can share countless stories about missing a huge pump while they were sleeping because they had their downside protected with a stop loss and were unable to set sell orders at their targets. Traders should never have to choose between taking profit and properly managing their risk.

I can turn $10 into $1,000 with leverage!

Leveraged trading is far too common among beginners. Leverage is a tool that should only be used by the most experienced traders, those who have proven to be profitable for years.

The barriers to entry are non-existent in crypto, on exchanges that are built to transfer the wealth of inexperienced retail traders into the pockets of the exchanges themselves. Beginners will likely lose everything they risk trading with leverage because the downside is massively compounded.

Getting rich quick is easy, right?

In legacy markets, nobody expects to get rich quick. Crypto appeals to people looking to quickly turn a small sum of money into their retirement, which is unrealistic. Twitter is selling Lambos while beginner traders end up selling their cars on the used lot to pay rent.

Those who got rich quick in crypto were most likely lucky, not good. Further, there is a difference between being wealthy on paper and in real life — most of the crypto traders who “got rich” failed to sell at the top and saw their paper wealth disappear as quickly as it was made.

Crypto is not a safe investment

An inexperienced person is far less likely to go broke buying a random stock than they are buying any available asset in crypto. The stakes are far higher! Crypto is not a safe investment and should only be a small part of someone’s overall portfolio.

I get all of my trade advice from a cartoon on the internet

While there are experienced and successful traders on social media, most beginners are learning from other beginners and don’t know it. Taking financial advice from strangers on the internet is the cornerstone of the crypto market.

There is no surer path to financial ruin than spending your hard-earned dollars on assets being shilled by avatars who are likely manipulating you for their own profit. Never base your decisions on the advice of those who don’t have to deal with the results.

Traders do not average down!

A common grave mistake many traders make is Averaging Down: buying more of the coin as the price drops with the logic that a good thing is now cheaper (an even better bargain). This logic applies to investing, not to trading.

A trader has an invalidation level for their idea — price dropping significantly should invalidate their trade and cause their stop loss to fire! Most beginners do not understand this and dig a deeper hole than necessary.

Risk management is everything

Risk Management is boring — and happens to be the most essential skill necessary to be profitable. Understanding how much to risk on a trade and how to properly balance a portfolio are exponentially more important than entries and exits. Learning this takes time — most new traders are broke before they understand risk.

Most people would be far better off slowly investing a small percentage of their entire portfolio in crypto — and in Bitcoin, in particular. Don’t be fooled by the avatars on twitter — trading crypto is hard.

You should conduct your own research when making a decision.",,https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjwjpd/someone-just-moved-a-billion-dollars-in-bitcoin-and-no-one-knows-why,"Last week, an unknown person or group transferred 94,505 bitcoins valued at over $1 billion USD in a single transaction. Now, observers are scratching their heads over the question of who is responsible for the eye-popping transfer.

Whale Alert, a Twitter account dedicated to live tracking of large cryptocurrency transactions, first spotted the transfer and tweeted an alert minutes after it happened late on Thursday night, EST time.

That transaction seems to be one of the recipient address’ first, followed by dozens of smaller transactions ranging from $6,644 to $.07. For now, it's anyone's guess as to who is behind the transaction, as the addresses involved aren’t known to the cryptocurrency community (all Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous but can gain recognition through re-use or public identification by the owner.)

There are only around 100 Bitcoin addresses holding more than 10,000 bitcoins, accounting for 14.95 percent of all mined coins, according to BitInfoCharts. Many of the largest holders are Bitcoin exchanges. Besides companies and institutions, there are also “whales” who have accumulated large hoards of bitcoins either through mining or savvy investing.

The idea that a business may be involved led to the theory that Bakkt, a Bitcoin futures provider that opened a “warehouse” to store customer funds on September 6, was responsible for the transaction.

TokenAnalyst, a blockchain data analyst firm, said on Twitter that a third of the bitcoins could be traced back to Huobi—a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange. “Our team is looking into the validity of the claim,” said a Huobi spokesperson according to Coindesk.

On July 29th, Larry Cermak, Director of Research at cryptocurrency news outlet The Block, spotted a whale moving 142,323 BTC (valued at $1.3 billion at the time). Cermak suggested that cryptocurrency wallet company Xapo may have been responsible.

One notable element of the $1 billion Bitcoin transfer is the fee—0.06 BTC, or roughly $600 USD. Fees are attached to Bitcoin transactions in order to incentivize miners to include them in the next block of data added to the Bitcoin blockchain. While some observers saw this fee as overpaying, others noted that getting a transfer worth $1 billion on the blockchain ASAP may have been incentive to the sender.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/winklevoss-gemini-crypto-exchange-launches-custody-service,"The New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded in 2014 by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has launched its own custody service, Gemini Custody.

In a news release shared with Cointelegraph on Sept. 10, Gemini said the newly launched custody solution will allow its customers to check balances, download account statements, initiate withdrawals, and grant auditors view-only access to confirm balances, transactions and activity.

Customers will also be able to trade their assets in custody on the Gemini exchange without waiting for them to be transferred from cold storage.

Eighteen supported assets

Gemini Custody reportedly supports 18 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC), as well as the following ERC-20 tokens: 0x (ZRX), Augur (REP), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Bread (BRD), Dai (DAI), Decentraland (MANA), Enjin (ENJ), Flexacoin (FXC), Gemini dollar (GUSD), Kyber Network (KNC), Loom Network (LOOM), Maker (MKR) and OmiseGo (OMG).

Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said that the much-needed maturation of crypto as an asset class depends on custodial security. He added:

“From day one, Gemini recognized the need for a world-class custody solution that is secure, compliant, and easy to use for individuals and institutions around the world.”

Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, managing director of operations at Gemini, explained that institutional investors have demonstrated a clear and growing demand for crypto, but that some struggle to find a solution that fully meets complex regulatory and security requirements.

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss recently said they are open to partnering with Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook’s Libra stablecoin project. Cameron argued that Libra represents a step forward in the mass adoption of cryptocurrency.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-price-chart-gives-hidden-bearish-signal-on-daily/,"Bitcoin price has been consolidating in a tightening range for the better part of the last three months, and the crypto community has been watching and waiting for the first-ever crypto asset to make its next move and choose the trend for the coming year ahead.

Bulls have been unable to push the price to new highs, but bears have equally failed to bring Bitcoin under support in the low $9,000 range. However, a hidden bearish signal just appeared on Bitcoin’s daily chart, and it could indicate that bears may finally win the battle for the short term.

Hidden RSI Bearish Divergence on Bitcoin Price Daily Chart

Crypto analysts and Bitcoin traders often perform detailed technical analysis in order to help them spot trend changes, or predict future price movements. In addition to drawing lines and shapes on charts, these analysts often couple that with the addition of helpful indicators and oscillators that further assist in determining a trading strategy.

One of the more popular indicators, especially for Bitcoin, the relative strength index, is giving off a “hidden” bearish signal called a hidden bearish divergence, that could suggest that further downside movement should be expected in the coming days.

Hidden bearish divergences occur when the relative strength index achieves a new high, while price fails to do so. This suggests that the price movement didn’t properly reflect the buying pressure indicated by the RSI, and that bears are gaining control over the price action.

RSI divergences are among crypto analyst’s most popular tools in determining potential trend changes and can be used to predict tops and bottoms. Most traders do not recommend taking positions due to hidden divergences but say investors should keep them in mind when looking at the overall analysis and price action before acting on the signal.

Bearish Downside Targets for BTC/USD Pair

Crypto analysts are torn on what the multi-month pattern Bitcoin price has been trading inside. Some say it is a bull flag, symmetrical triangle, or even a descending triangle – and each suggests a different breakout scenario.

If the RSI hidden bearish divergence does play out, Bitcoin price is expected to finally break down from the multi-month structure it has been in. Targets based on these structures would be somewhere around $7,000.

$BTC update: daily is looking bearish now. Shorting it if we break 10.2K. Will be adding if we break 10.150 all the way down to 9874, 9751 and 9427. Heavy resistance between 10.5 and 10.6K. Or it bounces here at 10.2K or it goes down. pic.twitter.com/xwrXvHUeOC — Nika (@G_maker) September 10, 2019

Before it reaches such a target, though, bears will have to push Bitcoin price down through $10,150, then additional supports layered throughout the $9,000 range.

At the Bitcoin Cash City conference in North Queensland, the CEO of Code Valley, Noel Lovisa, announced plans to build a $50 million dollar Bitcoin Cash tech park in the city of Townsville. The plan is to aggregate startup companies and there are more than 12 Bitcoin Cash focused startups already on board. Additionally, the BCH tech park creators aim to create a sister project with a mining and server facility built near the Kennedy Energy Park.

Code Valley CEO Announces Bitcoin Cash Tech Park

Over the last two years, many BCH proponents have heard about the city of Townsville on the coast of North Queensland, Australia. The city is well known for its dense population of BCH supporters and the 78 bitcoin cash accepting merchants. On Sep. 4-5, Townsville hosted the first annual Bitcoin Cash City conference, a BCH-centric event in a city full of supporters, developers, and BCH retailers. During the two-day event, participants heard from Code Valley team members like senior software engineer Mark Fabbro and CEO Noel Lovisa. The two discussed a subject called Emergent Coding which is essentially a software supply-chain or global compiler network that will work in concert with the BCH chain. “If the utility of BCH is going to be an international currency then at some point we’ve got to get the global economy using bitcoin cash,” the Code Valley CEO insisted during his talk at the event. Lovisa also told conference attendees that emergent coding will bring “a serious amount of economic activity onto the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.”

Lovisa further said that with emergent coding, the company didn’t want to stop there and aimed to leverage the benefits of Bitcoin Cash City as much as they could. So the company formulated a plan to create a Bitcoin Cash tech park based on Emergent Coding technology in Townsville. In Lovisa’s eyes, Townsville has an edge on adoption already and the city is “a year or more ahead” than most urban areas. The Code Valley executive told the event participants that a tender came up from the city for the redevelopment of the North Rail Yard and they won the tender. This means the project will partner with the city to develop the tech park Lovisa revealed. After the Bitcoin Cash City conference, news.Bitcoin.com spoke with Lovisa to get more information about the BCH tech park in Townsville.

A Technology Park Fueled by Bitcoin Cash Innovation

Bitcoin.com (BC): How did the Bitcoin Cash City Conference turn out?

Code Valley CEO, Noel Lovisa (NL): When all the delegates are eager to return next year for the 2020 Bitcoin Cash City Conference, I think you can say it was successful. A combination of a location in sunny North Queensland, extraordinary Bitcoin BCH adoption and differentiation such as a helicopter scenic built into the premium ticket, together with a great organizing effort managed to attract all the big names for speakers and sponsorship. It was really fun for a conference to walk the talk too with tickets in BCH, flights in BCH, accommodation in BCH, food, taxis, etc. We are planning a much larger event next year built upon this successful model.

BC: Can you tell our readers what initiated the planning for a $50M Bitcoin Cash Tech Park to be built in North Queensland?

NL: A North Queensland innovation called Emergent Coding is the fuse that lit the BCH tech park tender proposal. Emergent Coding is a distributed software development technology which trades the ability to specify completely bespoke software for extraordinary advances in software design speed, cost, native performance, and resource usage. Emergent Coding solves software’s “double-spend” problem to permit the first feasible developer specialization. It aims to combine the world’s 30 million developers into a single cohesive unit that designs software. Since these 30 million developers are spread around the world, Bitcoin Cash is ideal for rewarding these developers for their design contributions.

With such a large innovation and recognising the many startups moving into the Emergent Coding space, it was decided that a Bitcoin Cash tech park would be the ideal vehicle to anchor much of the development benefit for North Queensland. When the City’s North Rail Yard redevelopment tender came up, and given the Rail Yards are the traditional tech center of the city circa 100 years ago, making it the modern tech center of the city while preserving these heritage-listed buildings of the original yards seems like an unbelievable opportunity. While we have won the tender, there is still much to do before we can make the Bitcoin Cash Park a reality.

Clearly, North Queensland is investing big in the future of Bitcoin Cash and as seen by the conference, North Queensland gets stuff done.

BC: When is the BCH tech park project starting?

NL: It has been a very exciting year with our tender application initially being shortlisted, then winning the right to partner with the city on the project. Presently we are racing to reach a heads-of-agreement before Christmas as the local government goes into caretaker mode ahead of the election next year. While the site is complicated by the heritage aspects, we have put an experienced team together and expect to begin construction mid next year.

BC: During your talk at the Bitcoin Cash City conference, you mentioned 12 Bitcoin Cash focused tech startups in the area are involved with this project. Which BCH startups are included in this list?

NL: Leading the startup list is Code Valley Corp P/L and Aptissio Australia P/L, with the latter securing about $1 million in its first seed round and already delivering their first Bitcoin Cash products into the market. Aptissio’s focus is about applying Emergent Coding to BCH software development and they already have more than 700 Emergent Coding Agents online in addition to Code Valley’s 1,400 Agents. Aptissio hopes to field a BCH full node in the near future which may well be the most exciting Bitcoin Cash development since the fork.

It promises to amplify BCH developer productivity, provide a new developer funding model which excludes the possibility of capture, eliminates duplication of effort intrinsic in incumbent development, and much more.

But coming back to your question, Aptissio may be the leader and furthest along with the application of Emergent Coding, however there’s Echt Fin P/L, Lexcode legal P/L, Bitcoin BCH P/L, Townsville Mining P/L, Appening P/L, Cyclone AI P/L, SatoshiwareNQ P/L, Townsville Technology Precincts P/L and several beginning to appear in SOCAL such as Straya LLC, Coactive Blockchain LLC. These startups are in various stages of funding and active development and all in the Emergent Coding Bitcoin Cash space.

BC: Can you tell our readers about the mining and server facility to be built near Kennedy Energy Park?

NL: The sister project to the BCH tech park is the server complex. Emergent Coding has a vast need for server capacity to support its design agents and is dependent on Bitcoin Cash, so we want to support the Bitcoin Cash network with some domestic mining. North Queensland has an incredible site that promises to be highly competitive in terms of renewable energy, cooling, data, and low-cost real estate. We have completed a comprehensive technical due diligence on the site and are in negotiations over its development. I can not say more about this project at this time but watch this space.

Bloomberg reported Monday that Facebook wrote a letter to U.S. Senators about Libra, addressing concerns over potential Chinese influence on the cryptocurrency. Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) previously wrote to Facebook asking the company to exclude the Chinese yuan from the basket of assets backing the Libra stablecoin.

“Any decision whether to add a new currency to the Libra Reserve would be made based on all the facts and circumstances at the time, including any direct or indirect regulatory restrictions,” Facebook reportedly wrote, adding that the decision would be made by the Libra Association, not Facebook itself.

According to Bloomberg, Facebook provided a list of possible currencies to include in the Libra Reserve but appeared to stop short of saying that the yuan would be excluded outright.

The U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound and the Singapore dollar were included in the letter.

David Marcus, Facebook’s blockchain lead, previously told the U.S. House Financial Services Committee that 50 percent of the basket backing Libra would be U.S. dollars, with the other half in stable sovereign currencies and low-risk assets.

Controversial launch

Facebook first unveiled its vision for Libra this summer, announcing it would create two tokens: the fiat-backed stablecoin and a security token that members of Libra’s governing council could use to oversee the network.

The project faced immediate pushback, with regulators in the U.S. and a number of other jurisdictions immediately calling for the company to halt development until lawmakers’ questions could be answered.

Facebook’s Marcus testified before the House Financial Services and Senate Banking committees in July, attempting to reassure lawmakers that the cryptocurrency wouldn’t destabilize the global monetary system.

The company has pledged to continue developing the project, though it did say it would not launch until any regulatory concerns have been resolved.

Last Thursday the China-based mining rig manufacturer Bitmain announced the launch of two new Antminers that offer hashrates between 53 to 64 terahash per second (TH/s). When the Antminer sale started on Monday, first batch devices sold extremely fast and Bitmain expects to deliver units by mid-November. Meanwhile, the combined SHA256 hashrate (BCH and BTC) has grown exponentially, touching 100 exahash per second (EH/s) on Tuesday.

Bitmain Launches Two New Next-Generation Miners With Hashrates of 53-64TH/s

Mining coins like BCH and BTC is extremely competitive and recently mining rig manufacturers have been launching next-generation devices making the competition even greater. Last week, on Sep. 5, Bitmain Technologies announced the launch of its newest set of Antminers after releasing multiple versions of SHA256 mining rigs over the last few months. The latest versions include the Antminer S17e and the T17e which will be sold in three batches. According to Bitmain’s specifications, both machines have been optimized to perform with “significant improvements to power efficiency and hashrate.” The S17e has an average hashrate of 64TH/s and 45 joules per terahash (J/TH). The Antminer T17e offers hashrate speeds of up to 53TH/s and power efficiency of roughly 55J/TH. So far both batches of the new Antminers have sold out and the last sale will end Wednesday morning on Sep. 11.

In addition to the new Antminers, Bitmain introduced a compensation strategy for delivery delay. So if mining rigs are not shipped on the specified delivery dates then Bitmain will compensate customers with coupons for each day of delay, based on PPS rewards of the mining pool and electricity cost deducted. Bitmain explained that both new models have been created for better efficiency and longevity as well. “Both new models have been designed for more stable operations in the long-term to reduce maintenance costs for customers,” Bitmain detailed last week. “This is made possible through the dual tube heat dissipation technology which improves how efficiently heat dissipates. The models are also equipped with a more secure software system to prevent malicious attacks.”

Bitmain will also be hosting the second annual World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) in Frankfurt Germany on Oct. 8-10 2019. The two-day event will bring together some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the mining industry like Genesis Mining Marco Streng and Bitmain’s cofounder Jihan Wu. One specific event at the WDMS conference announced this week will be a contest for the “top ten mining farms around the world.” This will allow the mining industry to vote on the best mining farms out there today. In order to participate, miners need to disclose their location, capacity, mining farm systems, hosting price, length of operations, and submit photos of their crypto mines. Participants must submit all required materials by email before September 13 and winners will receive VIP tickets to WDMS.

High-Powered Mining Rigs Push the SHA256 Hashrate Above 100EH/s

With 64TH/s and 45J/TH, the new Antminer S17e would be the most profitable mining rig today, according to asicminervalue.com. At the time of writing, calculating current prices and with an electricity cost of $0.13 per kWh, the S17e would profit by $8.86 per day mining BTC (if it was available to the public today). Profits per day might be entirely different depending on the price per coin on Nov. 2019 and network difficulty. The new Antminer models will compete with the Microbt Whatsminer M20S (68TH/s), Ebang Ebit E11++ (44TH/s), and the Strongu STU-U8 pro (60TH/s).

The rest of the competitive mining rigs in the top list are other Bitmain models too such as the S17 pro (53TH/s), and the S17 (56TH/s). In 2019 Bitmain has released a wide assortment of SHA256 compatible miners including the new legacy S9 series, and the T version models. There’s still a bunch of low hashrate miners available on the Bitmain website, but most higher performance machines are selling out quickly. Still, with an electricity cost of $0.13 per kWh, any mining rig on the market that performs at more than 13TH/s is profiting at today’s BTC and BCH prices. On Sep. 10, it is currently 4% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain according to prices and Coin Dance statistics.

Both chains’ SHA256 hashrate combined on Sep. 10 crossed the 100 exahash per second (EH/s) region as BTC captured 98.53EH/s and BCH gathered 2.4EH/s. If and when SHA256 networks can exceed 500 exahash per second, the processing power will penetrate the zetahash era. BTC’s hashrate is 8X more powerful than Dec. 2017 at the height of the bull run, and this past June the BTC hashrate was 55EH/s which nearly doubled in three months. The BCH network hashrate has hovered between 2-2.6EH/s over the last three months with 11 pools processing BCH blocks. There are 10 pools mining BTC with 18.1% of the hashrate being stealth mined by unknown miners. On Sep. 10, 22% of the BCH network hashrate consists of unknown mining pools as well.

With market prices at what they are today, both BCH and BTC miners are seeing significant profits compared to last year’s prices. At current speeds, both SHA256 networks’ reward halvings will be at different times. The BTC chain is expected to see its reward halving in 248 days on May 16, 2020, while the BCH chain is expected to cut its block reward on April 8, 2020. Both dates are not exact and the time could change if hashrates increase or decline from here. The onslaught of new machines produced by manufacturers like Bitmain, Strongu, Innosilicon, and Microbt should continue to increase the overall SHA256 hashrates on both networks.

After last week’s comments made by an Apple executive suggesting potential interest in crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, many from the crypto community are expecting the company to follow Samsung’s lead and reveal support for the digital asset class. But here’s the reason why that won’t happen at today’s event and may prevent Apple from ever exploring crypto assets in a larger capacity.

Apple Shows Long-Term Interest in Crypto Assets

Last week, Jennifer Bailey, Vice President of Apple Pay told CNN that the company is “watching” crypto-assets like Bitcoin and others, and say they have “interesting long-term potential.” The crypto community immediately erupted celebrating what many saw as a nod of support from the smartphone manufacturing giant.

The company’s footprint is deeply rooted in digital innovation, and with Samsung – the firm’s fiercest competitor in the smartphone space – having already revealed support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the past, most assumed crypto being featured prominently on iPhones and iPads was a shoo-in.

However, crypto-assets like Bitcoin and others are actually directly opposed to some of the services that Apple offers and could prevent them the emerging asset class from ever being supported on an iPhone or iPad, now, or in the future. And at the very least, the digital asset class is likely to be entirely skipped over during today’s iPhone 11 reveal event. Here’s why.

iPhone 11 Won’t Likely Support Bitcoin or Altcoins

The marketing wave for the debut of ‘Apple Card’ has gone into full effect – a new “credit card” by Apple that it claims is different from what banks traditionally offer. It offers users 2% daily cashback on purchases, among a host of other features. The real benefits it offers is in security, speed, and convenience – the Apple Card exists as a physical card, but also as a digital card inside the increasingly popular Apple Pay.

Apple Pay is used both online and at retail locations for contactless payments. Apple Pay Cash is an internal service the company offers its customers to send funds back and forth with little to no fees and in seconds.

Much of what cryptocurrencies aim to achieve and currently offer is already eclipsed by what the firm has in place currently, and the brand will likely see little reason to disrupt their own services that earn them revenue, in order to support cryptocurrencies that they cannot control.

Announced Thursday at CoinDesk’s Invest: Asia event in Singapore, Lee’s new venture, Ballet, is rolling out a hardware wallet supporting multiple cryptocurrencies.

To differentiate its product and spur adoption outside crypto circles, Ballet will generate public addresses and private keys for users in advance.

Lee believes this design will make it easier for people who have no exposure to crypto to get hands-on experience with the asset without having to go through the set-up process most hardware wallets require.

“We wanted to create a wallet that is simple and elegant. And that is what we’ve done,” Lee said on stage Thursday.

Handheld

The wallet, also dubbed Ballet, is a piece of metal the size of a credit card that prints a QR code associated with the cryptocurrency wallet address set up by Lee’s firm.

On each wallet, beneath the QR code, there is a string of printed encryption code. At the bottom of the card, there’s another string of encryption code that’s coated, which a user must scratch off in order to see.

Only the combination of the two through Ballet’s iOS and Android app, also launched Thursday, will allow the user to see the private key, which will be the same key to access all cryptos on different blockchains that Ballet supports.

“I’ve been working on this hard since January of this year,” Lee said during his presentation. “We’ve gone through six iterations of this hardware wallet design.”

Currently, the firm’s product supports native cryptocurrencies on the bitcoin, litecoin, XRP, and ethereum networks as well as tokens that have been issued on specific blockchains such as all ERC-20 tokens.

Low price

To further the goal of fostering mass adoption, Lee said the pre-order price of Ballet will be $29, less than what existing hardware wallets with more advanced cold storage security measures cost. The company now eyes October for shipment after taking in pre-orders.

In a fireside chat at Thursday’s event, Lee said the project started in late December and has raised an undisclosed amount of capital in a seed round backed by Ribbit Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in crypto exchange Coinbase. Lee said Ballet has 20 staffers worldwide with a global headquarters in Las Vegas.

The company does the pre-setup for each wallet being sold to generate blockchain addresses and the associated private keys, but Lee said the firm deletes the data after production.

“We generated the keys for you in two locations thousands of miles apart,” he said. “[After that] we manufacture ourselves out of the process.”

Lee is mostly known in the crypto industry for running BTCC, one of the earliest crypto exchanges in China. He joined BTCC in 2013 as a co-founder and CEO, two years after the exchange was launched by Yang Linke, and helped the firm secure a $5 million Series A funding round backed by VC giant Lightspeed.

In January 2018, BTCC was sold to an unnamed blockchain investment fund based in Hong Kong, just months after China’s central bank issued a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as fiat-to-crypto trading.

This data offers an exclusive peek inside the evolution of the Iranian bitcoin community, and so far it looks like the classic “store of value” investment thesis can hold water.

More than a third of respondents, 35 percent, earned that income by mining, while 58 percent earned income through trading, both via exchange platforms and grassroots networks of local money changers providing liquidity with Iranian rials.

The survey indicated strong growth in the domestic mining industry, with 70 percent of respondents expressing interest in learning more about local mining businesses.

The Iranian crypto market is shifting its dominant focus from global exchange platforms to local exchanges and miners, because most centralized exchanges with know-your-customer (KYC) compliance exclude Iranians. Roughly 83 percent of survey respondents said the community needed more robust access to exchanges in order to grow.

In the meantime, a Gate Trade spokesperson told CoinDesk that many Iranians are using VPNs and purchasing foreign ID cards on the black market to circumnavigate discrimination.

Bitcoin developer and educator Jimmy Song told CoinDesk he has seen similar developments in other regions. The conduits may differ, yet they follow familiar patterns.

“In China, there are WeChat groups [for traders] because they don’t have as much direct access to exchanges,” he said, adding:

“I’m also hearing about a price premium in Argentina, for example, because the economy is facing some issues. … What we want, for all of these places, whether distressed or not, is for people to have the ability to accumulate capital and earn more money, to build things.”

The climate of censorship faced by Iranians has helped divorce local demand from global factors such as dollar prices, the gold market or even local stock markets. Up to 60 percent of respondents said such external conditions had little or no impact on their bitcoin investments. Most respondents were long-term holders, investing in bitcoin with the intention to hold it for more than a year.

Such is the case with Tehran-based blockchain developer Mahmoud Eskandari. He holds bitcoin, liquidates various cryptos as a side job and sends bitcoin to Iranian students abroad to help pay their expenses, including his relatives.

“Today it is clear to me that more and more people are using bitcoin,” Eskandari told CoinDesk. “Bitcoin has not had a profound impact on the lives of the Iranian people, but its use is growing among the people and I can see that.”

Roughly 29 percent of Iranian respondents hold more than $5,000 worth of crypto, mostly bitcoin. Compared to statistics from the CoinDesk 2018 reader survey, which reached predominantly American and European bitcoin users, Iranians are storing significantly more wealth in bitcoin.

Although 63 percent of CoinDesk respondents held more than $5,000 in crypto, Iranians are storing a higher concentration of their wealth. For context, only 14 percent of Iranian respondents earned more than $10,000 a year. Yet nearly a third of CoinDesk survey respondents were accredited investors and 13 percent described themselves as “crypto millionaires.”

“[Demand for bitcoin] is going to be felt in distressed economies much more than first-world economies,” Song said. “That’s to be expected because they feel the impact of inflation much more.”

Crystal published its “Report on International Bitcoin Flows 2013–2019” on Sept. 9, in which it provides insight into cryptocurrency operations and Bitcoin (BTC) transactions around the world between Jan. 1, 2013, and June 30, 2019.

U.K. and U.S. lead the rating

The findings show that the largest number of registered crypto exchanges are in the U.K., the U.S., Hong Kong and Singapore. Countries such as Argentina, India, Mexico, Russia and Indonesia report the fewest registered exchanges.

Per the report, almost 10% of all exchanges considered in the survey do not have countries of registration.

As for Bitcoin transactions, in 2013, 96% of all Bitcoin transferred between exchanges was sent by exchanges from the “G20 & Other” group (shown below), while in 2018 the number slumped to 70%. The report further states:

“In 2018, the total volume of bitcoin directly transferred between exchanges was almost $92.6 billion. A total of $65.1 billion was transferred by exchanges from G20 countries, Hong Kong, and Singapore.”

Impact of crypto regulations

As previously reported, G20 leaders reaffirmed their previous stance towards cryptocurrencies in a declaration following the G20 Summit in Osaka on June 29. The G20 leaders stated that cryptocurrencies do not currently constitute a threat to monetary stability, and that technological innovation can deliver significant benefit to the economy.

Although the U.K. is widely considered to be a global leader when it comes to crypto adoption and innovation, the environment is purportedly still confusing and complicated for exchanges, platforms and other related businesses, as the industry has been neglected in the push to protect consumers.",,https://observer.com/2019/09/crypto-startup-coinbase-losing-linkedin-top-startup-list-bitcoin-fall/,"Less than two years ago, when Bitcoin was at its peak near $20,000, every startup that was blazing the trail in the crypto ecosystem was celebrated as the darling of Silicon Valley. To some companies, that momentum even carried on into 2018, despite Bitcoin’s collapse, as trading platforms continued making money and the buzz around blockchain technology kept rising.

San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase, for example, raised $300 million in fresh capital last fall (when Bitcoin fell to $6,000), which made its co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong a billionaire, and was ranked by professional networking site LinkedIn as the third best U.S. startup to work for.

However, after another year of contemplation on Bitcoin and blockchain, it seems as if the world is losing interest in Coinbase and its many crypto peers.

On LinkedIn’s latest ranking of the 50 hottest U.S. startups to work for, Coinbase has dropped from last year’s No. 3 to a humble No. 29.

LinkedIn said its rankings are based on an analysis of billions of data points reflecting a company’s growth potential and the level of interest shown by job seekers, as well as the company’s current employees.

Blockchain payment startup Ripple, the company behind popular digital token XRP, has also slipped from last year’s No. 7 to No. 28 this year.

Other crypto companies in the top 50 last year, including Winklevoss twins’ Gemini crypto exchange (No. 25) and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin’s ConsenSys (No. 26), have dropped off the list entirely this year.

Coinbase recently lost a crucial relationship with the traditional financial world when British bank Barclays ended its partnership with the San Francisco company last month. Until then, Barclays had acted as a middle man in connecting Coinbase to the UK Faster Payments Scheme (FPS), allowing users to withdraw and deposit British pounds on the crypto exchange.

Since then, Coinbase has found a replacement with UK banking startup ClearBank. The impact of this series of events on Coinbase’s valuation—as well as Armstrong’s net worth—is hard to quantify until the company’s next round of fundraising.",2019-09-11 16:56:09+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/california-city-official-uses-bitcoin-cash-to-purchase-cannabis/,"California City Official Uses Bitcoin Cash to Purchase Cannabis

In California, cryptocurrency payments are making headway in the cannabis industry as Berkeley City Councilmember Ben Bartlett became the first elected official to purchase cannabis using a digital asset. On Tuesday, Bartlett utilized bitcoin cash (BCH) and Cred’s LBA token to facilitate the transaction at the Ohana Cannabis dispensary in Emeryville.

BCH and the Universal Dollar Stablecoin Used by an Elected Official to Purchase Cannabis in California

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have long dreamed of the cannabis industry and the cryptocurrency economy joining forces. On Sep. 10, the two industries made significant strides toward this effort when Berkeley City Councilmember Ben Bartlett purchased cannabis at a dispensary with crypto assets. The purchase at the Ohana Cannabis dispensary in Emeryville was part of a demonstration that showed the benefits of stablecoins and blockchain settlement.

The Ohana dispensary accepts bitcoin cash (BCH) and then takes advantage of the crypto financial platform Cred’s LBA token to finalize the settlement in the Universal Dollar. When Councilmember Ben Bartlett made the purchase, the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition and the Cred team was there on site to show the group of elected officials how digital currency solutions work. The cofounder of Cred, Dan Schatt, explained during the demo that digital currencies add far more benefits than traditional payment services.

“We are thrilled to build technology that solves real problems for customers, merchants, and politicians which will help usher in the next 100 million users of crypto,” Schatt noted during the event. The Cred cofounder added:

Not only does crypto result in significant cost reduction for consumers and merchants, but it also enables highly productive tax collection, transparency, and predictability for city and state governments.

The Blockchain Advocacy Coalition and California’s AB 953

The Universal Dollar stablecoin is an Ethereum-based token backed by USD and was created by the Universal Protocol Alliance. The group is made up of blockchain organizations including Blockchain at Berkeley, Uphold, and Cred. With members of Cred and the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition (BAC) helping, Councilmember Bartlett’s purchase “took seconds and resulted in substantially lower transaction fees for the dispensary.” Right now the BAC is sponsoring the assembly bill AB 953 which would allow the state to accept cannabis tax through a stablecoin. “AB 953 will allow cannabis companies to pay their taxes via virtual currency, specifically stablecoins,” the BAC website details. “This solves a significant banking issue for the state and lays the groundwork for broader statewide adoption of virtual currency.” At the time of writing, more than 70% of California’s state-endorsed cannabis industry is unbanked and these businesses are having issues dealing with financial institutions. Cannabis businesses incur significant risk by handling large cash deposits.

Many other cannabis-friendly states like Colorado and Oregon are having the same financial issues. California aims to innovate by creating progressive laws that help ease the problems cannabis operations are dealing with. “By providing a cash-free method of cannabis tax payments, AB 953 can reduce costs and safety risks for cities and businesses,” said Bartlett. The Berkeley City Councilmember also stated:

The Green Rush is a 21st-century industry; it deserves a 21st-century payment system. Tax payments in digital currency will help bring this new industry into the light.

California has been at the forefront of digital innovation, with epicenters like Silicon Valley and pioneering legalized cannabis for medical use in 1996, before opening the state to recreational use 20 years later. After the demonstration using BCH and Ohana Cannabis settling the transaction in the Universal Dollar, Councilmember Bartlett told attendees at the Emeryville dispensary that he also plans to have his staff draft a report on the benefits of accepting cannabis using digital asset solutions.

And while that’s likely a positive thing for crypto investors who have been burned by altcoin assets in the past, there are a number of alternatives US-based traders can visit to get a fix of the altcoin trading action.

Where Can US-Based Crypto Traders Still Invest in the Altcoin Market?

After tomorrow, the largest portion of the population of crypto traders, responsible for as much as 43% of market activity, will be barred from making deposits or making any trading on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

Binance currently offers a few hundred different altcoin assets, ranging from common major cap coins like Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple, to more obscure altcoins such as Ethos, Ripio Credit Network, or Storj.

However, when Binance ushers US-based investors over to their new Binance US counterpart, potentially as few as 30 different coins could be listed and that includes Bitcoin among the number.

As regulation spreads across the crypto market, fewer and fewer crypto exchanges are allowing users from different countries trade on their platforms. As of now, the only exchange that still offers some of the more exotic altcoins that and also still allows US-based investors to trade altcoins on their platform is Kucoin, according to crypto traders. However, given the fact that regulation should only increase further, there are still many risks associated with trading on platforms outside of the US, or trading altcoins that could potentially be deemed as securities in the future.

The next best option for crypto traders is to stick with one of the US-based crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Huobi US, Bittrex, and Poloniex. While these platforms lack as large of a catalog of altcoins – far less than the 30 that Binance US is considering – they do offer crypto traders from the US an added layer of safety and security.

The assets listed on Coinbase, for example, are known to comply with US law and have been extensively vetted by Coinbase’s team in accordance with regulatory guidelines established by the SEC and other government entities.

With much of the altcoin market cut off from the largest portion of traders, the market is at an impasse and should transform in the coming days as the value perceptions of altcoins change as a result of increased regulation.

It was revealed Wednesday at CoinDesk’s Invest: Asia event that the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) would be introducing the SOV through a forthcoming token pre-sale.

Called the Timed Release Monetary Issuance (TRMI), RMI minister David Paul explained that anyone (regardless of location) can register for the pre-sale on the newly launched website of the SOV Development Foundation. Paul stressed that the actual pre-sale for SOV – in which users buy TRMI units that can later be exchanged one-for-one with SOV units – is not yet live and is still “a work in progress.”

But once launched, Paul estimated it would be 18 to 24 months, or even less, before the real SOV is made available to the public.

“It could be well-vetted enough right before the TRMI that we don’t need the full 18 to 24 months,” Paul said. “You probably only need six months if all the preparation is done beforehand.”

One of the primary reason for doing this pre-sale, according to Paul, is to get a sense of the levels of liquidity and market interest in the SOV cryptocurrency.

Paul said:

“TRMI is really another way of doing an [initial coin offering] but in a more responsible and methodical manner. That’s really the TRMI. You have to look at how to establish liquidity. When you do TRMI, you’re looking at the appetite for the product and how it’s going to [behave] in the markets.”

This is a doubly important concern for government officials in the Marshall Islands given that the launch leaves no room for failure.

“For us, it’s really the reputation and integrity of a country on the line. We’ve got one shot at this,” said Paul.

Regulatory concerns

Apart from gauging market interest, Paul and his team at the non-profit SOV Development Foundation are also focused on addressing regulatory concerns surrounding the SOV raised by other countries and international organizations.

Last September, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised against the SOV project saying that the introduction of a cryptocurrency as legal tender in the country could “increase macroeconomic and financial integrity risks.”

Even the U.S. Treasury had told the RMI government “point-blank,” according to Paul, that it didn’t like the SOV. However, following nearly a year of internal discussions, Paul affirmed that U.S. officials are saying this project could work.

Getting the regulators on board is a key prerequisite to launching the TRMI, Paul said, adding:

“A nation cannot rebrand [like a company can]. That’s why we have to do this in such a way that’s different. It has to be transparent. It has to be inclusive. We need to make sure that we work with regulators to ensure that once we launch, they don’t go back and say, ‘Oh, you haven’t done this. You should have done that.'”

The question is where to keep it all.

It's not a simple matter, given the notoriety of the fledgling cryptocurrency industry, operating mostly outside the heavily regulated banking industry with a past pocked by hacks, scandals and regulatory fines. Hedge funds and other big institutional investors are unlikely to buy the digital currencies on behalf of wealthy clients and other investors unless there's total assurance that the assets are secure.

So now there's a race on among a handful of boutique financial firms and cryptocurrency exchanges trying to establish dominance in the business of custody -- the safekeeping of assets, similar to the way a bank holds cash and electronic deposits. The firms are adding features to try to win over new investor clients and make it easier to move assets in and out -- especially critical when there's a hot trade to be made.

Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange started in 2014 by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, saidthat it was expanding in the custody business to cover an enlarged list of 18 cryptocurrencies, including popular Bitcoin and Ether alongside more niche offerings like Bread and Enjin.

""The maturation of crypto as an asset class depends heavily on the safety and soundness of the custodians that hold individual and institutional funds,"" Tyler Winklevoss, who serves as Gemini's CEO, said in a press release.

The New York-based company has created a mechanism allowing investors ""instant liquidity"" to make trades -- instead of forcing them wait hours for the verification and other procedures needed to retrieve crypto assets from ""cold storage"" in the offline custody operation, according to Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, Gemini's managing director of operations.

A separate feature lets investors grant their auditors the ability to confirm balances and transactions in a Gemini custody account -- especially important for hedge funds that need to prove they own what they're telling investors they own.

""At the end of the day, to simplify things, it's sort of like putting your assets in a vault,"" Hightower-Sellitto said in a phone interview. ""You want to make sure when you want your assets, they'll be there.""

The point is that the cryptocurrency industry is developing its own back-office operations to support trading in digital assets, similar to the behind-the-scenes services that big Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) - Get Report , Citigroup (C) - Get Report , State Street (STT) - Get Report and Bank of New York (BK) - Get Report have historically offered to stock and bond traders.

The banks are mostly sidelined from the cryptocurrency market, due partly to a lack of clarity around U.S. rules; the industry still faces ample skepticism from financial regulators like the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission.

Yet neither Gemini, which is set up as a trust company and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services, nor its competitors are waiting for the banks to catch up.

""It takes a lot of engineering to build and maintain those systems,"" said Hightower-Sellitto.

In this series on Bitcoin and money, Crypto Briefing takes a deep dive into the complexities of the modern monetary system and how Bitcoin, as the ultimate hard money, can serve as a solution to many of its problems. We begin the series with an examination of the history of money.

Money. It makes the world go round. It has an inestimable effect on our everyday lives, yet we often take the way it works, and its history, for granted.

To gain a better understanding of money and how Bitcoin may serve society as the ultimate form of real money, let’s begin by looking at monetary systems, innovations, and the problems they faced in different places and periods in time.

Time and time again, one can observe that society gravitates back toward ‘real’ money.

Before money: the barter system

Despite its simplicity, bartering continues to hold some advantages to this day: when one barters, there is no need for money as goods or services are directly swapped. There is no need for any kind of intermediary to decide whether one should be allowed to make a trade or to determine that such a trade is fair.

One can find ancient examples of systematic bartering going as far back as the Phoenicians of 6000 BCE, who traded goods between a variety of cities across the Mediterranean Sea.

Bartering was also a common system for trading goods between the Far East, the Middle East, and Europe for many centuries, with traders exchanging spices, silks, salt, furs, perfumes and a variety of other desired goods between civilizations.

Bartering endures today and in some ways has made a bit of a comeback due to a variety of internet services that enable this form of non-monetary trade on a broader scale.

From Barter to Currency

In previous centuries, certain barter goods like weapons, furs, silks, spices, and even salt blurred the lines between bartering and money, with certain commodities eventually becoming a standard item of trade in the place of directly swapping goods or services. Some of these items became currencies, acting as a unit of value that had a standardized, agreed-upon worth.

British North America serves as a fairly recent and interesting example of a transition from barter to currency economies. The “made beaver”; a single high quality beaver skin, became a standard unit of account for the trading of a variety of items during the fur trade boom of the 17th century. The made beaver acted as a currency, buying eight knives or a kettle in 1795. Ten made beaver pelts could buy a gun.

The made beaver was, in essence, a currency, but only a mediocre one. Strict standards were enforced regarding the value of a made beaver in relation to goods. It successfully acted as a medium of exchange, enabling trade, and behaved as a unit of account for determining value. It was not divisible, however, and was only somewhat fungible as long as pelts met a given standard.

Managers of fur trading companies were occasionally caught attempting to trade low quality furs in the place of the higher quality made beaver currency. Thus, it was not entirely fungible and was also nowhere near as portable or durable as metallic coins could be.

Another big problem with made beavers as currency? Beavers mostly died out in the 1800’s, leaving few of the young beavers available for trading towards other goods.

The obvious solution, at least from our perspective today, was to use coins, such as the British shilling, to make trading more efficient: as long as traders were able to come to an agreement regarding the value of the traded coins in comparison to the furs.

This move from bartering to currency has taken place time and time again throughout economic history. Yet, bartering maintains its place in society for certain situations.

What Makes Money, Money?

So what exactly makes money, money? After all, if a beaver skin could be considered a currency, isn’t it really a form of money?

Not quite. Money differs from currency in a few subtle, but important ways.

Money is a little more abstract than currency. While currency is a tool used for trade, money is something which contains intrinsic value and does not need value to be assigned to it by any authority.

More often, the expression “hard money” is used to evoke the idea of an item such as gold or silver, that holds intrinsic value because it is difficult to acquire; whereas currency is often a paper or other sort of promissory item that is used to represent value and is comparatively easy to produce.

For money to be considered real, it must meet a sort of checklist of attributes:

Money must be a medium of exchange. In other words, it must be able to be used to trade for goods or services instead of exchanging another good or service, as in the barter system.

Money must be a unit of account, being interchangeable with goods or services at a set price.

Money must be portable. It has to be able to be transported from one user to another to complete a transaction.

Money must be durable so that it can be used over a relatively long period of time without breaking down and becoming worthless.

Money must be divisible in order to make purchases of various prices.

Money must be fungible, meaning each unit is the same as the next. A particular dollar has the same value as another dollar.

A Store of Value

Importantly, real money is distinct from currency as it is also a store of value over a long period of time. Currency does not have intrinsic value, but is a tool that can be used to transact value. Because governments can print currencies continuously, the production of currency transfers wealth—or the actual value of real money—to the governing powers, once the currency is issued.

For the best example of real money that has persisted over the past many centuries, look to gold. Gold can not be printed, so it maintains its scarcity, unlike printed money. It endures in monetary value regardless of the value of a given currency at a given time.

While paper currencies come and go, often diminishing in value over time, gold has retained value as hard money for millennia. Unlike many currencies, gold endures; it can be melted down or converted into jewelry or electronics, but it does not corrode or break down (at least, not in human lifetimes!) and continues to exist indefinitely in various forms.

The gold that existed thousands of years ago still exists today, in some form.

Historical Attempts at Currency

We need to go back to ancient times to find our first examples of currencies created to serve economies.

Electrum is one such example—a gold and silver alloy, sometimes referred to as green gold. The naturally occurring alloy also contains traces of copper and other metals. It consists of many impurities, and varies greatly in size, quality, and density. Still, it was useful as far back as the Old Kingdom of Egypt, nearly 5,000 years ago, where it was used for exterior coatings on pyramids and obelisks, as well as for drinking vessels.

Electrum saw widespread usage as a currency during multiple centuries from the 7th century BCE to about 350 BCE. The alloy was more durable than the much softer pure gold, and refining gold to purity was much more of a challenge than it was in the following centuries, when refined gold and silver coins became the norm. The key problem with electrum was the variations in purity that made it unsuccessful in the long term as a truly fungible currency.

Over time, the amount of gold in an issued electrum coin was reduced. Because gold retains its intrinsic value, the coins would cost more than their assigned value if the proportion of gold to other metals was maintained.

Other cultures in different time periods came up with a variety of currencies to serve their economies. The cowrie shell was traded across regions including Africa, China, and India, being useful as a currency since it was distinctly shaped, small, and light. Its fine and detailed texture made it nearly impossible to counterfeit. The shells traded for hefty sums of goods in regions that lacked natural supplies.

Chocolate, in the form of cocoa beans, was an excellent form of currency for the people of the Aztec culture over a period of a couple centuries. Like today’s paper currencies, not just anyone could produce the cocoa beans; production was controlled in order to ensure its value could be maintained. This form of money allowed for the trade of goods all over much of what is now Latin America.

Rice played the role of money in feudal 17th century Japan. One could exchange rice for goods, use it to pay taxes, and even pay workers’ wages with the grain. Being very light and easy to transport, rice enjoyed utility as a currency for many years in Japan. In fact, the shift from rice to metallic currencies was first met with considerable uneasiness and doubt.

All of these currencies operated under the basic premises of consensus and supply and demand.

In these societies, a consensus existed that agreed to assign a value to an item that might have been seen by outsiders as an irrational and worthless value. Yet, the currencies worked at some level because the society that traded them agreed to their value, and thus allowed for trade and economic interaction via the currencies.

The basic premise of the free market principle of supply and demand also held true and consistent with this system, as an over-supply of shells rendered them worth considerably less than they were in distant locales where they were difficult to attain. Still, these currencies had their limitations and could not fully replicate the characteristics of real money.

A Return to Real Money

Throughout the world’s economic history, one can observe a predictable return to real money from flawed currencies. As far back as the 7th century BCE in Greece, gold and silver staters were used for trade, and are the earliest known examples of real money.

These coins, which began as electrum, but eventually were refined and met all the characteristics of what real money should be, endured for centuries. Beginning as ingots and later being developed into coins, the stater was a trusted and stable form of money for close to 800 years.

Because of the use of gold in the coins—a hard money which maintains intrinsic value due to its scarcity —the comparable wages of people 2000 years ago in gold is nearly equivalent today:

“In the era of Emperor Augustus (27 B.C. to 14 A.D.), a Roman centurion was paid 15,000 sestertii. Given that one gold aureus equaled 1,000 sestertii and given there was eight grams of gold in an aureus, the pay comes to 38.58 ounces of gold. At current prices, this is about $54,000 per year. … The centurion who commanded 80 legionaries is roughly equivalent to a U.S. Army captain. The current wage for a captain is $46,000—which is fairly close. This implies that gold is a good store of value. Essentially, gold is a good inflation hedge—but our examples are over the very, very, very long term, more than 2,000 years.” (source)

Still, paper currencies offered greater convenience and ease of use, as seen in the next example from China’s long and varied history with money.

Flying Money

We must look to the Tang dynasty of China for the earliest example of paper currency. This currency was known as “flying money” because of its novel tendency to be blown away in the wind, unlike metal currency.

In 800 CE, the government replaced copper coins with the revolutionary paper currency. The metal currencies were in short supply and were inconvenient for long-distance trade between merchants, so the new paper currency was seen as an elegant and innovative solution. The new paper currency saved the need to ship large quantities of metal currency to far-flung merchants.

Although it wasn’t technically considered legal tender and was intended to be “cashed in” for metal currency, it was used as such by merchants because of its convenience and portability.

The first state-backed and enforced printed currency was established during the following Song Dynasty (1024 AD). Only these official banknotes, issued by the government, were permitted as currency, and were backed by the metal currency of the era.

Inflation Rears Its Ugly Head

It was during the Chin and Yuan dynasties that we see economies fall victim to the temptation of over-printing—using paper currencies that were not sufficiently backed by hard money (in these cases, copper and silver). In an attempt to maintain monetary controls, silver and gold were confiscated by the state. Eventually, however, these paper currencies collapsed due to inflation as the over-zealous printing of currency, in a futile attempt to buoy the economy, resulted in extreme inflation.

During the following Ming and Qing dynasties, a gradual return to hard money took place after failed attempts at paper currencies. The innovation of paper currency eventually spread westward to the Middle East, and then to Europe, with Sweden being the first European country to issue a paper currency in 1601.

As can be seen in the long history of money in China, economies are inevitably drawn back to metal currencies as a true hard money that can not be printed into oblivion. In societies around the world, economies eventually gravitate toward hard money due to its natural free market advantages and enduring resistance to inflation, thanks to its undefeatable scarcity.

Fiat in Modern Society

During the 20th century, much of the world’s paper currency was somewhat protected from the extremes of inflation due to the requirement that the currency be “backed” by gold or silver.

After learning the lessons of inflation with the Continental Currency of the late 1700’s, America turned to a standard that was designed to prevent such a failure. Backing each U.S. dollar with gold or silver ensured that the currency represented a genuine value. Being more rare than silver and less prone to excessive supply spikes, gold eventually took over as the standard backing for U.S. currency, with the ability to cash in dollars for the equivalent value in the rare metal.

When countries veered away from the gold standard during times of war, for example, citizens often turned to hoarding metal currencies to protect themselves as bank runs revealed an inability to access paper currency funds.

After World War II, the Bretton-Woods system established an agreement whereby currencies all over the world tied their value to the U.S. dollar, which rested on the gold standard. This meant that virtually all global currencies were linked to the value of gold, creating a global standard for money.

Of course, it’s one thing to say money is backed by gold—actually backing it by gold is an entirely different story. As many nations grew to resent America’s currency advantage, countries around the world began to lay claim to their share of gold reserves, cashing in their unwanted U.S. dollars. This created a huge problem; namely, more demand for gold in dollars than actually existed in reserves.

The Nixon Shock

The gold standard effectively came to an end under the Nixon administration, when the government unilaterally cancelled the ability to directly convert the U.S. dollar for its equivalent value in gold. The move was touted as a hugely successful response to an exchange crisis caused by foreign meddling, so much so that markets like the Dow enjoyed their greatest gains ever, the day following the announcement.

Since then, however, we find ourselves back in a floating-fiat paper currency scenario that remains all too familiar. We have returned, once again, to a very recognizable stage in the ongoing cycle between real money—gold and silver—to paper currencies that are prone to over-production.

Inflation caused by excessive printing, and in some cases, hyperinflation in mismanaged or heavily sanctioned economies, is inevitable and ongoing, but not just regionally.

Now, the effect has become a global phenomenon.

The Digital Age

A coinciding global phenomenon is the digitization of currency. Often referred to as “cashless payments”, debit card, credit card and more recently, mobile payments, consisting of services such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal, dominate daily monetary transactions and are particularly popular in the United States. In China, the WeChat Pay application is used by over 600 million people.

Cashless payments have ballooned over the past decade and are projected to accelerate worldwide. The following table displays global cashless transactions in billions by region from 2012-2016 with projections through 2021:

Like paper currency, these digital forms of payment are not inherently scarce and suffer from the same flaws as many currencies of the past, although they can be more convenient for a variety of scenarios.

The current state of near-cashless economies foreshadows a looming threat of falling interest rates, whereby currency users could be trapped in a continuously inflationary environment with no option to “cash out”. Such digitized currencies lack the capacity for monetary independence and privacy that is offered by cash, and especially by real money.

Bitcoin, Ultimate Real Money

Time and time again, we have seen throughout the world, a return to real money. Real money must be….

A medium of exchange, used to trade for goods or services.

A unit of account that is interchangeable and able to establish a set price for goods or services.

Portable. More portable than any other form of currency, Bitcoin can even be stored in your mind via a 12 or 24-word mnemonic phrase.

Durable. Being an immutable blockchain secured by massive hashrates, Bitcoin can not be destroyed without an enormous expenditure of energy and money.

Divisible. Bitcoin can be divided to the 100 millionth, representing a single satoshi in value. It could be further modified by adjusting the protocol in the future, if necessary.

Fungible, where each unit is the same as the next.

And, like gold and silver, Bitcoin is scarce, with only 21 million BTC that will ever exist, making it a store of value as hard money.

Although it is a digital iteration of money, it retains scarcity due to its protocol, thanks to the nature of blockchain technology. Bitcoin also uniquely retains the advantages of the age-old bartering system. It allows permissionless trade between parties and has no need for intermediaries in order to enable successful transactions.

It is the ultimate real money, superior to all previous forms, including gold and silver.

To fully understand Bitcoin’s superiority over all previous forms of money, we will continue this series next with a closer look at the gold standard and gold’s comparisons to Bitcoin in greater detail.",2019-09-11 19:30:03+00:00

Bloomberg Tax reported on Le Maire’s declarations on Sept. 12. Per the report he noted:

“We believe that the moment the gains are converted into traditional money is the right time to assess tax.”

Easier transaction tracking

The author of the report also explains that such an approach to taxing cryptocurrency trading would help with tracking transactions, which he believes to be a common challenge in crypto-to-crypto trading. Le Maire also reportedly addressed Value-Added Tax (VAT) application to cryptocurrencies.

More precisely, he explained that VAT is to be applied to cryptocurrency transactions only when they are used to acquire an asset or a service. France is reportedly already implementing the new approach to cryptocurrency taxation.

Meanwhile, in Portugal

As Cointelegraph reported at the end of August, Portugal’s Tax Authority has clarified that both cryptocurrency trading and payments in crypto will not be taxed in the country.

Also in August, a tax bill seeking to allow the exclusion of gain or loss on like-kind exchanges of virtual currency has been introduced in the United States House of Representatives.",,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-cryptocurrency-idUSKCN1VX2H0,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Jason Sanchez, 35, was able to start buying spare parts online last year for his cellphone repair shop in Havana thanks to the advent of cryptocurrency trading in Communist-run Cuba.

Cuba, which in many ways remains stuck in the analogue past, may seem an unlikely hotbed for cryptocurrencies - digital tokens that use encryption techniques to secure transactions.

Yet the roll-out of mobile internet nearly a year ago has opened the way for cryptocurrency transactions, and enthusiasts have multiplied as the currency helps overcome obstacles created by U.S. sanctions on Cuba.

The decades-old U.S. trade embargo cuts Cubans off from conventional international payment systems and financial markets. Cubans cannot obtain credit or debit cards for international use on the island and struggle to do so abroad.

So Cubans like Sanchez are buying digital currencies, which are mostly unregulated, decentralized and anonymous, to make purchases online as well as to invest and trade.

“This is really opening new doors for us,” said Sanchez, who uses Bitcoin, the most well known cryptocurrency, to purchase parts not available new in Cuba from an online Chinese store.

Alex Sobrino, founder of the Telegram channel CubaCripto where Cubans debate and trade digital currencies, said he estimated some 10,000 Cubans were using them.

“We are using cryptocurrencies to top up our cellphones, to make purchases online, and there are even people reserving hotel rooms with (it),” said the 33-year-old, who trades crypto as a side gig to his family’s baking business.

To be sure, it is unlikely the digital coins will become a primary payment method for the Caribbean island’s 11.2 million inhabitants any time soon.

Cryptocurrency trading still falls in gray legal territory in Cuba.

And since Cubans mostly do not have credit cards, many have to ask relatives abroad to purchase them their first installment of cryptocurrency or buy within the community on social media channels like CubaCripto, which has more than 400 members.

Often the two sides of the deal meet face to face for the buyer to hand over cash and the seller to carry out the transaction on a laptop or phone.

Sanchez bought fractions of Bitcoin - which are worth around $10,000 each - through a startup founded a year ago by Cubans in Brazil that aims to make crypto purchases more businesslike.

CUBA’S FIRST CRYPTO EXCHANGE

Fusyona, which bills itself Cuba’s first crypto exchange, uses the hard currency of people abroad who want to send remittances to Cuba to invest in any of nine major cryptocurrencies via a larger exchange.

It then uses the pesos of Cubans who want to invest at least the equivalent of $150 in crypto to pay the remittances. The website, which charges a fee of up to 10 percent, has some 1,300 users to date.

“For foreigners, cryptocurrencies is just another option,” said founder Adrian C. Leon, a 31-year-old Cuban computer scientist based in Rio de Janeiro.

“But for Cubans it is a necessity and can be a solution to their exclusion from the global financial community.”

Several crowdfunding platforms shut down accounts for victims of the tornado in Havana earlier this year, for example, despite donations being legal, simply due to the mention of Cuba.

Foreign platforms are nervous about carrying out even legal transactions regarding Cuba due to past multimillion-dollar U.S. fines on institutions for violating sanctions.

Fusyona however set up its own donations account in Bitcoin that faced no such problems.

CUBAN GOVERNMENT CRYPTO?

The Cuban government said in July it was itself exploring the potential of cryptocurrency, following in the footsteps of other countries under U.S. sanctions like Venezuela and Iran.

During a brief stay on the island, U.S. fugitive, crypto evangelist and founder of McAfee antivirus software John McAfee made headlines saying he would be willing to help Cuba in the endeavor.

However Cuba could, like Iran, choose to develop an experimental national cryptocurrency even while banning trading in existing digital currencies due to concerns about money laundering or a clash with its Communist principles.

“We worry the government will restrict us, prohibit things, start to say this is illicit enrichment,” said Sobrino.

He added that he would welcome government support of the fledgling crypto community and was aware of the need to protect would-be investors from scammers taking advantage of the lack of regulation, as elsewhere in the world.

Leon said he was nervous his agents on the island who receive and transfer cash might be suspected of dodgy financial dealings and has started talks with Central Bank officials about the possibility of getting an official stamp of approval for Fusyona. The business is registered in Brazil.

The Central Bank is exploring the benefits and risks of the digital currency, state-run website Cubadebate said on Tuesday.

Professor Alexi Masso Muoz of Havana University’s cryptography institute was cited as saying there are no laws on the topic currently, “although it is possible it will shortly have some.”

In the meantime, the craze is reaching even Cuba’s eastern regions, far from the cosmopolitan capital.

“I hope in the future cryptocurrency will be par for the course for all Cubans,” said Ruslan Concepcion, 27, who lives in the quiet eastern city of Las Tunas and invests in crypto to earn extra income.",2019-09-12 18:20:41+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/premier-leagues-watford-fc-puts-bitcoin-logo-on-kit-accepts-btc,"The Bitcoin (BTC) symbol will now appear on the shirt sleeve of Watford Football club players, and the team will also accept the cryptocurrency for merchandise purchases.

The team will also accept the leading cryptocurrency as a payment for its merchandise.

According to the official post, the logo’s addition to the uniform is part of a wider campaign aiming to “improve awareness around Bitcoin and educate the public on the benefits of using cryptocurrencies.”

The head of marketing of the team’s main shirt sponsor Sportsbet.io Justin Le Brocque said that the company is giving back to the crypto community:

A new fund from investment giant VanEck and financial technology player SolidX Management gives big-money buyers a way to invest in bitcoin, a significant step for the largely unregulated and highly scrutinized cryptocurrency market.

The exclusive over-the-counter product, which began trading last week on an alternative trading system regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, shares similarities with exchange-traded funds, but is not technically considered to be an ETF because it is not traded on a national exchange.

And, if you ask Jan Van Eck, CEO of Van Eck Associates and president and CEO of the VanEck Vectors ETF Trust, this move is a way to bridge the gap between run-of-the-mill investing and the burgeoning world of crypto.

""The big [cryptocurrency] exchanges are completely unregulated, and the traditional world has sort of said, 'I don't want to look at this. I'm not going to touch it,' even though CoinBase has 20 [million] to 30 million client accounts,"" Van Eck said Wednesday on CNBC's ""ETF Edge."" ""So, these two worlds are completely separated, and we're trying to do a little bit of an overlap and we'll see if it works.""

Named the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust 144A Shares and available only to ""qualified institutional buyers,"" the product has drawn more than $40,000 worth of investment since its launch.

But ""we're not directly or indirectly trying to sell to retail [investors]. That's not what this game is,"" Van Eck said. ""Any individual, no matter how rich, can't buy it. It has to be an institution. It has to be a corporation [or] a bank, but a hedge fund can buy it, a mutual fund can buy it, and an ETF can buy it. So ... even a $20 million ETF could buy this fund and get some bitcoin exposure.""

And, with the SEC still harboring concerns about approving retail-investor-facing bitcoin ETFs, this incremental step is still key to the progress of bitcoin as an officially regulated, tradeable asset, ETF consultant Chris Hempstead said in the same ""ETF Edge"" interview.

""This is a step in the right direction,"" said Hempstead, formerly head of ETF sales at Deutsche Bank. ""We've had this kind of thing happen in the ETF world over and over again for the last 25 years. What you have here is a new idea that's making progress towards something that people are very familiar with.""

This occurred with traditional ETFs, is currently underway with nontransparent ETFs and is now starting with the introduction of this bitcoin-based fund, Hempstead said, adding that he'd still like to see ""proof of concept"" for VanEck and SolidX's product.

""I think the SEC and the regulators will recognize that it works for institutional buyers and it might get them to take a step towards making it available to retail [investors],"" he said. ""Remember, the word is comfort. The SEC and the regulators, as well as retail investors, need to be comfortable in the product that they're investing in, and this is the closest thing we have right now to getting there.""

Disclaimer",2019-09-12,https://www.coindesk.com/history-favors-the-bulls-as-bitcoin-trades-sideways-at-10k,"View

Bitcoin’s long-term bullish bias remains intact, with prices holding well above the historically strong support of the three-day chart’s 55-candle exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $8,972. The line served as a strong base in the 2016–2017 bull market.

A bullish falling-wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart looks likely and could pave the way for a retest of recent highs above $10,900.

The prospects of a breakout would weaken if prices find acceptance below Wednesday’s low of $9,855 on the back of a rise in selling volumes. That would expose support at $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rally has stalled in the last 10 weeks, but the bullish case remains intact with prices hovering well above a historically strong price support.

The leading cryptocurrency broke into the latest bull market on April 2 with a high-volume rise from $4,000 to $5,000. It subsequently went on to hit a 17-month high of $13,880 on Bitstamp on June 26.

Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has charted a narrowing price range with lower highs above $12,000 and higher lows below $10,000, as seen in the chart below.

The consolidation is reminiscent of a contracting triangle near $6,000 seen in the August to October period last year. That narrowing price range had ended with a downside break in November.

The latest consolidation, therefore, may force investors to question the validity of the bullish breakout confirmed in April.

However, it is too early to call an end of the bull market and the risks will remain skewed to the upside as long as the cryptocurrency is defending the three-day chart’s 55-candle exponential moving average.

That EMA line served as a strong base during the 2016–2017 bull run. As of writing, the EMA is located at $8,972, while at press time BTC is changing hands at $10,145 on Bitstamp, representing a nearly 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

3-day chart

At the end of October 2015, bitcoin’s outlook turned bullish with prices rising above $300. The cryptocurrency then formed a series of higher lows and higher highs to hit a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.

Notably, the higher lows (marked by arrows) were established along the ascending (bullish) 55-candle EMA and almost every bounce ended up setting a higher high.

For instance, bitcoin’s pullback from the June 2016 high above $770 ran out of steam below the 55-candle EMA at $542 in August 2016 following which prices rallied to $1,100 by January 2017.

On similar lines, pullbacks to the 55-candle EMA in April 2016 and March, July, and September 2017 fueled stronger rallies. Not once were sellers strong enough to force a convincing close below the 55-candle EMA.

Hence, the bullish case put forward by 2019’s second-quarter price rise is likely to weaken only if and when the three-candle finds acceptance under the 55-candle EMA, currently at $8,972.

In fact, any pullback to the crucial average will be the biggest test for the bulls. A strong bounce from that level will likely cement expectations of a rally to fresh record highs above $20,000.

As for the next 24 hours, the odds appear stacked in favor of a move higher for BTC.

4-hour chart

BTC is trapped in a falling-wedge pattern, a bullish continuation setup, as discussed yesterday. Trading volumes have dropped throughout the pullback from $10,949 to $9,855 (Tuesday’s low).

So, the probability of BTC witnessing a wedge breakout is high – more so, as the widely-tracking trend-following moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.

The Chaikin money flow index, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, is also reporting a bullish divergence – higher lows contradicting lower lows on price.

A wedge breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors for a retest of recent highs above $10,900.

The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below Wednesday’s low of $9,855 with a solid rise in selling volumes.

Bitcoin could see a total ban in the United States if its price reaches $100,000, a well-known industry commentator has warned.

Tom Lee: ‘Nothing Out Of Reach’ For US Gov’t

In a Twitter debate about Washington’s snap ban on flavored e-cigarettes on Sept. 11, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee vented concerns about lawmakers’ power to wipe out entire markets overnight.

A regular Bitcoin 00 commentator, Lee noted previous negative comments on crypto by President Donald Trump and his administration.

The ease with which e-cigarettes will disappear from the US, he suggested, meant other contentious phenomena could suffer the same fate.

“This is un-related but shows White House can issue an ‘executive order’ banning anything. And could even ban bitcoin,” he wrote.

“Not expecting it. But with current White House, there is “nothing out of bounds nor out of reach.”

According to a statement on Wednesday, the US government and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are determined to eradicate e-cigarettes, at least temporarily, in order to assess their safety.

Complaints allege manufacturers such as Juul are deliberately targeting underage consumers with nicotine-based products. Reports of a “mystery” lung disease on the rise have exacerbated demands for a ban.

Now, flavored e-cigarettes will no longer be available for purchase legally, and must be withdrawn within 30 days.

Agreement On $100K Bitcoin Ban

Continuing the debate about the likelihood of a Bitcoin ban, Lee argued government temperament directly depended on price.

Trump tweeted his dislike for cryptocurrency when BTC/USD circled $10,500. Should it become worth ten times that he said, the Trump administration would be much more likely to forbid US residents to use it.

“True, agree,” he wrote in response to another Twitter user who forecast the $100,000 ban.

While the concept of a state outlawing the supposedly ‘unbannable’ decentralized Bitcoin often sparks anger, little evidence has emerged of how governments would apply such a law.

Attention currently focuses on India in particular, where authorities have repeatedly called for the criminalization of any cryptocurrency not approved by them.

While some dismissed the idea as unworkable by default, Delhi sparked considerable anger from the industry. Tim Draper, the billionaire investor and supporter of Bitcoin and Blockchain project Tezos, called India’s government corrupt.

“They are in fact saying, ‘we will not tolerate progress.’ It will set them back 40 years,” he said in July.

A press release shared with Cointelegraph on Sept. 11 revealed that Berkely City Councilmember Ben Bartlett used Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and the stablecoin Universal Dollar (UPUSD) to make the purchase at Ohana Cannabis, a dispensary in Emeryville, CA.

The purchase was part of a live demonstration of crypto-financial technology conducted by blockchain company Cred and the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition. The latter is a group of California-based businesses and consumers that work to promote transparent blockchain legislation at a state and national level.

Cannabis Tax Remittance Via Stablecoin

According to the press release, the initiative forms part of the Blockchain Advocacy Coalition’s sponsorship of a new bill (AB 953) that would enable California to accept cannabis tax remittance via stablecoin. During the demonstration, the team at Cred was reportedly on hand to explain the ins and outs of blockchain and stablecoin technology to local elected officials.

The transaction involved Ohana accepting Bitcoin Cash by using Cred’s LBA token as a translation utility, with sales and city tax proceeds settled in Universal Dollar.

Universal Dollar — which runs on the Ethereum blockchain and is pegged to the US dollar — was developed by the Universal Protocol Alliance, a coalition of blockchain firms including Cred, Uphold and Blockchain at Berkeley.

In a statement, Dan Schatt — co-founder of Cred and the Universal Protocol Alliance — outlined:

“Not only does crypto result in significant cost reduction for consumers and merchants, but it also enables highly productive tax collection, transparency, and predictability for city and state governments.”

Crypto for the Green Rush industry

As the press release notes, 70% of California’s state cannabis industry is unbanked, significantly increasing both the risks and costs faced by local governments required to accept tax remittance in large cash deposits.

Councilmember Bartlett remarked that in providing a cash-free mechanism for cannabis tax remittance, the proposed AB 953 bill represents a piece of innovative legislation appropriate for the 21st-century so-dubbed Green Rush industry.

The politician has now reportedly requested Berkley City staff to prepare a report on acceptance of cannabis taxes using stablecoin technology.

“Opening new doors” in retail

Without access to debit or credit cards for international use, cryptocurrency-enabled purchases are a welcome opportunity for consumers. In an interview with U.S. News, local resident Jason Sanchez said cryptocurrencies were “opening new doors” for Cubans.

Exchanges where cash is swapped for Bitcoin in person — using a mobile or laptop to carry out the transaction — are another option, the report notes.

The platform allows people abroad to send remittances to the country, or to invest in nine different cryptocurrencies via a larger exchange — with services charged at a fee of up to 10%.

The central bank reportedly revealed earlier this week that it was exploring the benefits and risks of digital currencies.

In July, Cuba’s economy minister Alejandro Gil Fernandez said the government was consulting with academics to study the potential use of cryptocurrency for its national and international commercial transactions.",,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/09/13/539766.htm,"Euro zone governments and central banks are working on a long-term plan to launch a public digital currency that they hope would make redundant projects like Facebook’s Libra, which is seen as a risk to financial stability, officials said on Friday.

The 19-country bloc is also united in pursuing a tough regulatory approach should Libra seek authorizations to operate in Europe. It is also considering a common set of rules for virtual currencies, which are currently largely unregulated.

The currency union has worked in past years on several plans to make digital payments cheaper and faster, but none of them has properly taken off so far.

But plans unveiled in June by U.S. social media giant Facebook to launch its own digital currency, Libra, for payments among its hundreds of millions of users in Europe and around the world have triggered a rethink.

Libra was “a wake-up call,” European Central Bank (ECB) board member Benoit Coeure told a news conference in Helsinki after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers.

He said Libra had revived efforts to widen the uptake of an ECB-backed project for real-time payments in the euro zone, known as TIPS. The project, launched last year, has been met with caution by banks.

“We also need to step up our thinking on a central bank digital currency,” he added, unveiling a so-far little known plan.

An ECB official said the project could allow consumers to use electronic cash, which would be directly deposited at the ECB, without need for bank accounts, financial intermediaries or clearing counterparties.

These actors are all needed now to process digital payments, but may no longer be necessary if the ECB took over their functions, slashing transaction costs. Libra’s plan also would do without financial intermediaries.

Work on the ECB project started before the launch of Libra and could last months or even years, Coeure said. The technical feasibility remains to be seen and opposition from banks is likely.

France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters he had a plan to make the “public digital currency” work and would discuss it with other ministers next month.

Legal Limbo

Meanwhile, European Union authorities are sending Facebook a clear message that Libra is not welcome in Europe.

“Certainly the bar set for regulatory approval will be very high,” Coeure, who is a Frenchman and will end his ECB mandate at the end of the year, said.

Le Maire added that Libra could cause risks to consumers, financial stability and even “the sovereignty of European states,” and repeated his pleas to block Libra in Europe .

While euro zone ministers seem united on a tough regulatory line on Libra, it is less clear whether they agree to set up common rules for virtual currencies.

The EU’s financial services commissioner, Latvia’s Valdis Dombrovskis, is always careful to underline that cryptoassets are an opportunity as much as a threat.

The EU does not have specific regulations on cryptocurrencies, which until Libra was unveiled had been considered a marginal issue by most decision-makers because only a tiny fraction of bitcoins or other digital coins are converted into euros.

New EU-wide rules came into force last year to increase checks on virtual currencies’ trading venues with the purpose of reducing risks of money laundering and other financial crime.

But apart from that, virtual currencies move in what is largely a legal limbo in the EU, as regulators have not yet managed to agree on whether to treat them as securities, payment services or currencies in themselves – the latter option being ruled out by most.

In the absence of specific regulations, EU officials are assessing whether existing rules governing financial instruments could apply, but have so far reached no conclusion.

When asked whether Libra would need a license to operate in the EU, a spokeswoman for the European Commission told Reuters that an authorization would likely be necessary. But “with the publicly available information on Libra, it is currently not possible to say which exact EU rules would apply,” she added.

In Switzerland, Libra is applying for a payment service license, although it could face rules that typically apply to banks, regulators in the non-EU Alpine state said on Wednesday.

The EU-wide legal vacuum has paved the way for smaller states to fill it. Tiny Malta, which already hosts the bloc’s largest online gambling industry and an outsized finance sector, has devised its own framework to attract virtual currency operators.

It is unclear whether Malta and other smaller EU states would agree with Le Maire’s tough stance on Libra and cryptocurrencies.

Crypto is not illegal in China, but it is illegal for banks and financial institutions to deal in crypto. It’s also illegal for nationals to send over $50,000 in fiat money in a day, without government permission. Restrictive banking regulations, international trade wars, and a surveillance state in the midst of political unrest mean that transferring money can be difficult. In spite of bitcoin’s somewhat precarious legal standing, Chinese are nonetheless finding a ready avenue of non-draconian, free market exchange using crypto channels to prosper even in the face of economic oppression.

The State of Crypto in China

Since a series of government bans in 2017, there’s been a lot of debate and misunderstanding as to the actual nature of crypto regulation in China. The long and short of it is that crypto is not illegal, per se, but is viewed as property under Chinese law. ICOs, non-OTC exchange of crypto, and brokerage services involving cryptocurrencies are all illegal. Basically, any transaction directly connecting government fiat like the yuan, and cryptocurrencies, is off-limits. Banks may not deal with bitcoin, and exchanges cannot facilitate the purchase or selling thereof. As for mining, a proposal to ban the activity was made in April, but hard action in this area has not been taken.

In spite of all this, the legal gray area of OTC trading is still alive and well, facilitated largely via offshore exchanges, VPNs, and stablecoins like Tether’s USDT. Some large, since-relocated exchanges like Huobi, continue to make trading possible by functioning as OTC fronts, with messaging and payment apps like Wechat being used to facilitate settlement after traders are connected via the Huobi platform. As China continues to crackdown on secure, decentralized digital assets, the state is also preparing to launch its own centralized asset, a kind of digital yuan, very soon.

Other Financial Restrictions

Not only are crypto transactions heavily regulated in the economic powerhouse, Communist nation, but fiat transactions as well. Chinese nationals are prohibited from international transfers of over $50,000 per day without special permission. Some have found a way around this by simply making numerous smaller transfers with several different parties assisting in the process. Unofficial brokerage firms also employ this method. Expats living in China have no such monetary amount limitations technically, but must prove that their income is legal before making transfers, which can be a cumbersome and sometimes impossible task. According to Josh Summers at travelchinacheaper.com:

For those who want to transfer money out of China, there are quite a few more regulatory hoops you’ll need to jump through … Even if you’ve paid all the necessary taxes, it’s common for people to run into roadblocks at the bank.

Circumventing Transfer Limits and Regulations With Crypto

The sea of murky, potentially prison-sentence inducing regulations still isn’t enough to deter users of crypto and advocates of economic freedom. Bitcoin is just too convenient where nation states are sluggish and incompetent. Overseas exchanges can still be accessed using VPNs, and though the Chinese government is cracking down in this area as well, use continues. In fact, the use of VPNs must be allowed for major corporations to do business in the restrictive cyber atmosphere of China’s “Great Firewall.” Even the iron-fisted People’s Bank of China (PBOC) knows this, and won’t starve the economy with such impositions. According to one local source:

Whether or not it is legal or illegal to use a VPN in China is a very grey area, and the government deliberately make it so … many businesses in China need VPN.

Chinese residents can also use a VPN to access peer-to-peer, OTC trading sites like Local.Bitcoin.com and exercise economic autonomy freely, buying and selling BCH and fiat currencies via a large array of diverse payment channels. Trade volume on sites like localbitcoins.com remains steady as well, proving that regardless of government restriction, crypto, like nature, will find a way.

The Tether Pipeline

Stablecoin Tether (USDT), with a market cap that just recently surpassed $4 billion, is the dominant crypto tool utilized these days by major Chinese traders. Tether Holdings has also launched a Chinese yuan stablecoin called the CNHT. While some question the wisdom of competing with the Communist giant in the field of currency issuance, others are supportive of the effort, thanks to the liquidity and relative stability the USDT stablecoin is already providing. Of course, still others are more concerned that pegging anything to a tanking world reserve USD, which has been steadily devaluing for well over a century, is not a good idea.

This notwithstanding, USDT is still a superhighway currently for getting around restrictive government regulations. Crypto network data provider Coin Metrics reported that in July USDT accounted for 40% and 80% of transactions on Binance and Huobi, respectively, according to reports. Should the dollar finally meet its demise in the face of expanding negative interest rate policy worldwide, and unremitting irresponsible fiscal policy, however, it will be the true free market, decentralized options that remain.

Tech Brings Free Market Solutions

For those who call the vast country of China home, and who appreciate its diverse beauty and culture outside of the foul taste of government meddling, leaving the country to pursue financial freedom may not be a desirable option. Thankfully, technological innovation has made much of the antiquated and force-based practices of legacy finance obsolete. Utilizing tools like VPNs, chat apps, legal gray areas, and emergent crypto transfer protocols, even as governments continue to restrict freedoms, crypto finance expands and affords users natural solutions. The momentous deluge of a powerful river can’t be stopped by an ad hoc network of sticks, or a sign reading “no water.” In this same way, crypto continues to flow above, under, and around unnatural barriers, worldwide.

Cryptocurrencies undoubtedly bring new business opportunities. The expanding industry around digital assets and its customers need more and more services that traditional sectors can provide. Banking is often a bottleneck in the crypto space as most traditional institutions are still reluctant to get their feet wet. Smaller banks, however, are more willing to occupy this niche and reap the rewards.

Aiming for a Reward That Justifies the Effort

Navigating the regulatory maze, in the midst of which most crypto companies operate these days, is not easy. Organizations from other industries which work with crypto firms have to deal with the same obstacles. It’s often hard to do business and make a profit. But the current situation also creates opportunities, for there’s a margin to be made in this kind of environment. And it’s usually the small, young and hungry businesses that accept the challenge, hoping that the reward will justify the risks and efforts.

Most big banks have been shying away from the cryptosphere, be it because of the regulatory uncertainty, the volatile nature of the market, or maybe they just see a threat to their good old ways of banking. But small-size financial institutions and representatives of the nascent fintech industry cannot afford to be so shy. In the fast-moving cryptoconomy, every opportunity the growing sector offers is worth exploring and exploiting.

The case of the German WEG Bank illustrates this very well and shows that banks and crypto companies can cooperate in a mutually beneficial way. In the summer of 2018, as part of a partnership deal, the crypto payment provider Tokenpay Swiss AG acquired a 9.9% stake in the bank with plans to increase its share in the future. And this spring, Nimiq, a provider of browser-based payment solutions, also bought 9.9% in WEG Bank. The two now work on a crypto-fiat product called Nimiq Oasis.

A Bridge Between Two Financial Worlds

WEG Bank is now promoting itself as an institution that bridges the gap between traditional banking and digital currencies. According to an announcement posted on Twitter, it has recently secured “full access to a crypto trading and custody license in Estonia.” The bank noted that it’s also applying for a securities trading and custody license in Germany. The licensed Estonian vehicle, WEG Bank later clarified, is WEG Blocklink OÜ, which is its sister company that will act as a servicer to WEG Bank AG.

Estonia has been a leading force in Europe when it comes to creating a favorable business climate for crypto companies. However, it’s been reported that authorities in Tallinn have started tightening some of the rules applicable to the sector. The new regulations oblige locally registered entities to keep their headquarters in the jurisdiction, while foreign companies are required to maintain an office in the Baltic country.

Fiat Products Backed With Crypto Assets

Having crypto companies among stakeholders is not a mandatory prerequisite to being a crypto-friendly financial institution. Since the launch of its crypto business six years ago, San Diego-headquartered Silvergate Bank has established itself as one of the few banks in the United States that is readily providing services to the digital asset industry. It serves more than 500 entities dealing with cryptocurrencies.

Silvergate has announced its intentions to offer loans collateralized with cryptocurrency. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the lender describes its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) and explains that “an exchange client could hold the digital currency collateral, we could use the SEN to initially fund the loan from our balance sheet, and in the event of a collateral deficiency, we could immediately sell the digital currency collateral through our exchange client and use the SEN to bring the resulting funds back to our balance sheet.” Further elaborating, the bank points out:

We believe there may be attractive opportunities to provide digital currency borrowing facilities to deepen our high quality customer relationships and further enhance our interest income.

Other crypto-friendly banks operating in the United States include New York-based Quontic, which is now providing services to crypto companies in its strictly regulated jurisdiction. Elsewhere in the U.S., businesses from the industry can manage their finances with the help of institutions like Simple Bank and Ally Bank. In Europe, corporate and private clients can rely on the banking services provided by a new generation of online and mobile banks such as Revolut, Wirex, Bankera, and Bitwala.

Fintech startups have immensely helped the expansion of crypto banking. Their platforms turn your smartphone into a bank office or a crypto exchange, challenging the traditional understanding of what banks should look like. They are willing to experiment and cater to the needs of crypto businesses and users. In the face of this competition, large financial institutions have yet to integrate digital assets into their business models and strategies.

Banks working with cryptocurrencies and companies specializing in crypto-related banking are likely to see more regulatory clarity in the future with the adoption of comprehensive national legal frameworks. Along with Estonia, Malta, Gibraltar, and Switzerland form a group of nations where crypto businesses can operate in a friendly regulatory environment. For example, financial authorities in Switzerland recently licensed two companies, SEBA Crypto AG and Sygnum AG, to serve as banking institutions for the country’s growing crypto industry.

And under increasing pressure, old Swiss banks like Zurich-based Maerki Baumann are turning towards the crypto market. “We suddenly had 400 people wanting to talk with us. And they were exactly the kind of people we had been struggling to access for 10 years with traditional private banking offerings,” CEO Stephan Zwahlen told Swissinfo last month. “We found that they were typically between 30 to 40 years old, very well educated and with an entrepreneurial mindset,” he added, speaking about how his bank found an alternative revenue source in the Swiss crypto sector.

Outside of exchanges, few cryptocurrency industries are as prosperous as custody. At this stage in Bitcoin’s lifespan, trading crypto and storing crypto appear to be the most popular use cases for crypto – in that order. As a result, a thriving aftermarket for crypto storage solutions has sprung up, both custodial and non-custodial, hot and cold, online and offline. Card Wallet from Coinfinity is the latest product to enter the fray, providing a secure way for storing BTC and ETH offline.

Cold Storage Is Hot Right Now

As the dangers of storing funds online in custodial wallets and exchanges have been emphasized through a plethora of hacks and exit scams, the cold storage business has boomed. From hardware wallets resembling fancy thumb drives to devices disguised as calculators and credit cards, the range of ways to self-custody digital assets seems endless. The simply named Card Wallet by Coinfinity does exactly what it sounds like. On the surface, this plastic card looks like an extremely low-tech way to store bitcoin core or ether, but its unprepossessing exterior is deceptive. Peer a little closer at the credit card-shaped wallet and you’ll notice some interesting details.

There are all kinds of anti-counterfeiting measures at play on the Card Wallet’s service, including microprinting and continuous color gradient techniques, giving it a look more akin to cash. The banknote-based design makes sense once you learn that Coinfinity – Austria’s first Bitcoin company – developed this device in conjunction with the Austrian State Printing House. They’re best known for printing passports, a skill they’ve refined over the course of 200 years, and thus know a thing or two about anti-counterfeiting.

Forgery-Proof Crypto Storage

The notion of forgery sounds strange in a crypto context. After all, bitcoins are impossible to falsify. The reason why the Austrian State Printing House has gone to town on the anti-forgery techniques they’ve used is to prevent fake cards from entering circulation and to provide guarantees that the private key, which was generated offline, remains offline. The private key for the cryptocurrency address printed on the card is concealed beneath a hologram on the back. It’s accompanied by a warning not to scratch this area – not even a little, just to test it – as to do so would be to risk the security of your funds. The Card Wallet is basically a modern version of the Casascius physical bitcoins that have become collector’s items today.

The code printed beneath the Card Wallet’s seal can be thought of as Schrödinger’s key: until the moment it is observed through scratching off the protective covering, it effectively doesn’t exist. The manufacturer has no record of it. As a result, you can send funds to the address printed on the front of the card, but you can’t retrieve them until you reveal that seal, and doing so will essentially penalize you to the tune of the $67 the Card Wallet retails for. Think of it as an extremely high BTC network fee, and use it as an incentive not to dip into the funds stored on the card, save for an emergency.

Of course, technically nothing is stored on the card: it simply holds the secret code needed to send the bitcoin from the address in which it is currently locked on the BTC network to a new address on the network. To all intents and purposes, though, Card Wallet might as well physically hold those coins, since without it to hand, you’ll never be able to move those coins again.

Testing the Card Wallet

Unlike a hardware wallet, there’s nothing to power up or plug in here, but that doesn’t mean that testing the Card Wallet is an entirely analog experience. There is, after all, the QR code printed on the wallet, which, when scanned, reads the BTC address printed along the center. In testing, I scan the code using the Bitcoin.com Wallet and am prompted to select the amount of BTC I wish to send. When I drag the slider, the funds are released and that’s it: the first satoshis prepare to wing their way to my Card Wallet.

When the time comes to move or sell that bitcoin, I will remove the security seal and import the private key that’s revealed underneath into a noncustodial wallet such as Electrum. In theory, you could continue to use the wallet address securely, even with the seal scratched off, provided you destroyed the exposed private key. There would be little advantage to doing so, however, and it makes sense to view the wallet as compromised once the key has been revealed.

On the reverse of the card, there’s another QR code that can be scanned, marked Chainlockcode (CLC). This requires installation of a dedicated mobile app, which will display the balance of the card – and of any other Card Wallets you wish to integrate into it – allowing you to manage all your cards within one app without revealing their private keys. Most people are unlikely to need this, since typing the wallet address into a block explorer achieves the same result, but if you’re a serial Card Wallet collector, it might prove useful

Alternative Cold Storage Solutions

While Coinfinity doesn’t support BCH at this time, bitcoin cash holders have the option of generating their own paper wallets, which can be printed at home. This theoretically provides the same security guarantees, and with the wallet folded and sealed correctly, it is effectively tamper-proof, albeit without the same allure as Card Wallet’s impressive shiny hologram. Cold storing cryptocurrency isn’t about showing off, however, and the winning wallet is the one that keeps your funds the safest.

Some bitcoiners will balk at paying $67, in the Card Wallet, for a cold storage solution they could roughly replicate at home for the cost of a sheet of printer paper. Others will appreciate the imperviousness of the Coinfinity card, its convenient credit card shape, and its superior tamper-proof seal. As such, its value is really in the eyes of the beholder. For the same price you could pick up a basic hardware wallet, which will allow you to send, receive, and store a range of cryptocurrencies. That said, there’s something magical about the seal on the Coinfinity that challenges you not to sully it, but rather to sporadically send funds to it, building up your nest egg over time.

Bank of Venezuela hints at crypto wallet

As cryptocurrency news outlet Decrypt reported on Sept. 13, BDV clients have discovered a new section in their online banking account dedicated to cryptocurrencies.

At present, the crypto wallet only caters to Petro, but as the section appears to be still under development, speculation suggests more tokens may follow.

Petro, launched by the Venezuelan government, is notionally pegged to the country’s oil reserves. The United States Treasury Department believes President Nicolas Maduro wants the digital currency to help Venezuela evade international sanctions.

As Cointelegraph reported, Venezuela is becoming increasingly reliant on decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), as other alternatives prove unreliable.

Huge inflation affecting its national currency, the bolivar, has led to record-breaking trading volumes on peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange LocalBitcoins.

For the week ending Sept. 7, the most recent period for which data is available, Venezuelans traded more than 120 billion bolivars for Bitcoin.

Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie might make a crypto-first, that could become another crypto experiment and change the NBA landscape.

This player is to begin his three-year contract extension with the Nets, worth USD 34.36 million. What he’ll do is start his own company in order to securitize that contract in the form of a digital token, the Athletic reported, citing ""multiple sources."" That’s just the first step in the process of securitization. By turning his contract into an investment tool, the player should get a lump sum upfront, and though the exact amount he wants to raise is unknown, it will be less than the total amount of the contract. It would enable him to make an investment right away.

The National Basketball Players Association was informed of Dinwiddie’s decision this week, according to the report.

However, details are scarce and it's not clear how this model would work exactly.

So what are the risks? “Dinwiddie has a player option worth USD 12.3 million in 2021, and if he opts out and earns more on his next contract, it is unclear how that would impact investors,” the article claims. It added that the underlying collateral to the player’s plans is his contract, and while NBA is there to stay, based on the history of pro athletes trying to convert their future earnings into investment vehicles, “the biggest threat would be if somehow the Nets could cancel that contract for detrimental conduct.”

According to the analysts from the NBA’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), “this could potentially shift the league landscape” by changing the way in which players make decisions and assess risks, and the way in which they see contracts, the article adds. However, it states that CBA can handle any attempt at circumvention of it and its rules. “The approach could create ripple effects should Dinwiddie’s model prove successful,” concludes the Athletic.

Financial scammers are selling cold, hard cash for only 10 to 12 cents on the dollar to buyers willing to provide a prepaid fee in Bitcoin, according to the new Q3 2019 Black Market Report from Armor’s Threat Resistance Unit.

Dodging risks

The money laundering scheme sees cybercriminals offer up bundles of cash — typically from $2,500 to $10,000 — in exchange for a 10% to 12% fee payable in Bitcoin.

Once the buyer has transferred the cryptocurrency, they provide details of the bank, PayPal or Western Union account where the money should be sent.

As an extremely simple, turn-key service, this arrangement offers buyers sky-high returns on their illicit purchase and removes the need for a money mule or the risk of logging into compromised accounts.

As the report outlines, money mules are agents who transfer ill-gotten funds between accounts in exchange for a fee of 10% to 20% of the value. Such actors typically open costly business bank accounts in order to avoid triggering fraud alerts or drawing unwanted attention when transacting large volumes.

Notably, this conversion scheme benefits those selling the stolen funds because they avoid taking possession of the funds and instead merely transfer them — meaning the buyer carries the risk.

A highly attractive offer

Chris Hinkley, head of Armor’s Threat Resistance Unit, said:

""For those scammers who don’t possess the technical skills and a robust money mule network to monetize online bank account or credit card credentials, this is an offer that can be very attractive [...]. This clever service gives them an additional channel for monetizing the large amounts of financial data available on the underground.""

As previously reported, United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently claimed that cash is not laundered to the same extent as Bitcoin, declaring that the government was intent on preventing the cryptocurrency from becoming the “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.”

Reporters responded with some skepticism to Mnuchin’s stance, quipping in response that his argument was essentially — and somewhat illogically — that:",,https://cryptobriefing.com/why-bitcoin-how-money-works-today/,"Share this article

In this series on Bitcoin and money, Crypto Briefing takes a deep dive into the complexities of the modern monetary system and how Bitcoin, as the ultimate hard money, can serve as a solution to many of its problems.

In Part Three of the series we examine the forces that shape current monetary policy. The full nine-part series is available here.

So far in this series, we have examined the history of money and found that hard money has consistently returned to dominance time and time again throughout history.

Following this, we considered the differences between two of the hardest forms of money to produce; gold and Bitcoin. Bitcoin, it turns out, has a few distinct advantages over gold whilst retaining the qualities that make gold such an excellent hard money.

Today, we examine the current monetary situation around the world, which now operates under a global fiat monetary system that relies heavily on the American dollar for settlements between economies.

Fractional Reserves Undermine Money

One should not overlook the importance of fractional reserve banking and the impact this innovation had on the generation of wealth over recent centuries. This approach to generating profits on savings and loans allowed for enormous economic growth, beginning in 14th century Europe.

Fractional reserve banking as a practice is often traced back to the Renaissance era, during which such investment innovations were first made famous by the Medici family of Florentine Italy.

In essence, fractional reserve banking is the act of a bank taking a deposit from a client and thus holding a reserve of value that is tied to the value of the deposit. However, if it stopped there, it would not be “fractional” in nature.

Importantly, the bank allows the withdrawal of said funds to other clients as loans, keeping only a fraction of the original deposit in reserve. A simple example expresses the enormous monetary expansion that can take place within such a system.

Consider the following scenario:

Bob deposits $1,000 in the bank. Ten percent of the deposit must be held in reserve, according to central bank policy, so the bank allows another client, Joe, to borrow up to ninety percent of the $1,000 deposit, which Joe then uses to buy a car.

The car dealer then deposits the proceeds of $900 in the bank. Now, $1,900 magically exists from the original deposit of $1,000.

The bank then loans out ninety percent of the $900 that is now available. This pattern of depositing and lending fractions of deposits continues until eventually the $1,000 that Bob deposited has expanded the circulating amount of money to approximately $10,000.

Bob could at any point withdraw his $1,000, which probably wouldn’t be a problem since many other clients are also depositing funds from which the bank can generate loans.

What would be a problem, however, is if Bob, Joe, the car dealer and all the other depositors in this chain of fractional saving and borrowing decided to withdraw funds all at once. This would cause a “run on the banks”.

Fiat’s Fractional Reserve Issues…

This might seem merely hypothetical and unlikely to actually occur, but it happens frequently in fractional reserve banking systems around the world.

If a bank is even suspected of not holding enough funds in reserve, clients may become nervous and feel more financially secure holding cash rather than trusting that their bank is actually solvent. Bank runs have occurred from time to time in all kinds of situations, even in relatively stable economies like the United States.

Among the most well-known of these bank runs took place in 2008 during the housing meltdown, when the IndyMac bank saw depositors withdraw approximately 7.5% of the bank’s deposits after finding out the bank was not viable.

Other long-trusted banks like Washington Mutual and Wachovia failed around the same time due to massive bank runs as depositors rushed to withdraw their funds in the panic caused by the housing loan collapse.

Despite these fiascos, banks around the world continue to operate on slivers of reserves, lending out funds far beyond the actual monetary supply available to them in deposits. In America, most banks of significant size are required to hold around ten percent of deposits in reserve, like the amount used in our previous illustration.

The Federal Reserve can change this minimum to increase or decrease the money circulating in the economy.

Banks can also gain interest on reserves as an incentive to keep a healthy quantity on hand, although the exact percentage that constitutes a “healthy reserve” is highly subjective.

The European Union, for example, operating under the rules of the European Central Bank, only requires banks to hold one percent of deposits in reserve. This means 99% of deposits can be recirculated back into the economy, essentially fabricating money with extremely thin safety rails to hold things together.

The possibility of bank runs becomes significantly more likely in such scenarios. Amazingly, central banks in Canada, Sweden, and Australia have no reserve requirements whatsoever!

Quantitative Easing Undermines the Dollar

To be clear, the phenomenon of fractional reserve banking is a fundamental driver of growth in successful modern economies. In and of itself, it is not necessarily detrimental, but has been shown to be problematic when reserves are not maintained. Where it gets really problematic is when it is mixed into a potent monetary cocktail with other modern economic phenomena including quantitative easing, interest rate manipulation, and currency conflicts.

Quantitative easing, or QE, is a complex affair involving open market operations between central banks and member banks that cause monetary expansion, meaning more money moving around in the economy. The central bank buys securities from member banks, generating liquidity in the economy. It sounds complicated, but the effects of it are really quite simple.

When the Federal Reserve performs this quantitative easing, it allows banks to have a greater quantity of money than they need in their reserves. Naturally, banks would then be expected to lend out these funds for further profits.

Other elements of QE, such as the purchase of Treasurys, force interest rates downward and allow for more borrowing and spending to stimulate the economy. Ultimately, quantitative easing prints money, which has significant implications and effects on the economy as a whole.

It should be noted that the process of QE did enjoy some success in eradicating subprime mortgages and in keeping the economy afloat, at least artificially. The fact that banks did not lend out as much as expected, instead investing in stock buybacks that garnered them enormous wealth, kept perceived levels of inflation from spiraling out of control, at least in the early stages of the strategy.

As of now, bank authorities have tentatively declared an end to QE, generally considering it a moderate, or even under-appreciated success.

But quantitative easing appears to be irresistible to policy-makers, having been used four times since 2008. Many argue it will continue to be used ad infinitum, despite assurances to the contrary from the powers-that-be. Each time it is used, the money supply grows, and the value of each dollar diminishes relative to assets that store value.

The global value of gold and real estate has grown enormously over this past decade, at least partly, if not entirely, due to QE policies. Many consider this massive monetary supply boost to be the root cause of highly fragile asset bubbles that are destined to pop at some point.

The USD money supply has grown tremendously during the past decade of repeated QE monetary practices, causing the potential for huge asset bubbles. As much of the world follows in-step with USD currency policy, the global money supply can be observed to follow an identical pattern.

It bears mentioning that Bitcoin was born at the beginning of the decade of monetary experimentation known as quantitative easing, and has seen astronomical growth in value over this period of time.

Due to the tiny volume and speculative nature of Bitcoin investment, however, this growth in Bitcoin’s market value is not necessarily evidence of causation by QE. Growth in gold and real estate prices as well as indebtedness, on the other hand, demonstrate a clear causal relationship, deeply affected by the phenomenon.

Yet, the status of Bitcoin as a store of value certainly becomes more convincing when considering the economic implications of QE strategy.

Inflation Undermines Money

The most obvious result of QE policy is the resultant inflation that occurs due to an expanding money supply. Paired with low interest rates approaching zero or even negative territory, assets have seen precipitous growth as the wealthy seek shelter for their monetary holdings in stable hosts.

Foreign real estate investment has become highly problematic in countries such as Canada and New Zealand, causing residents to struggle in their quests to find affordable housing. Instead of using homes as a place of residence, properties are bought and held as stores of value, rather than storing fiat currency that is steadily diminishing in relative value. Both countries have attempted to quell foreign interest in their housing markets with foreign buyer taxes and, in the case of New Zealand, outright bans on foreign ownership of real estate.

This problem is worsened by low interest rates that encourage higher pricing as borrowers qualify for ever-higher mortgages.

Low interest rates approaching, and at times, surpassing zero, can further compound the problem with the current trend toward cashless economies. A number of countries in the European Union, including Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden, have established federal interest rates in the negative range.

Negative Interest Rates Undermine Money

The goal of negative interest rates is to stimulate spending artificially due to the lack of legitimate demand in the economy. Rather than holding money, it is better to spend it, as borrowing is incentivized over saving.

These same countries are moving away from cash as a currency, relying instead on digital money which is on a constant path toward inflation, diminishing in buying power as it languishes in digital bank accounts. This situation is sometimes referred to as a zombie economy, where free market dynamics have faded and the economy is instead artificially propped up, with no real incentives for long-term investment.

It’s worth noting that just a few days ago, Donald Trump suggested that the US move to a negative interest rate economy.

In this sense, inflation is ultimately another form of taxation that is cleverly deceptive… in that it does not appear as such. Governments are able to spend money without needing to plead with voters to increase taxes. Rather, nations can print money as desired, reducing the power of money held in the bank accounts of unknowing citizens, all while assets and everyday living needs continuously creep upwards in cost.

It is because of the creation of easy money that this combination of inflation-inducing events is at all possible. Without easy money, zombie economies would be staved off as fractional reserves would be held in check, quantitative easing would be impossible, and inflation would be much more gradual and benevolent.

De-dollarization, Its Meaning for Bitcoin

While hard money like gold and Bitcoin exhibit free market value through the natural dynamics of supply and demand, fiat currencies only manage to maintain value via trust and ultimately, coercion.

The American dollar has succeeded as the dominant fiat currency with which the world trades due to international agreements and global dominance in military power. This role as the dominant world reserve currency is precarious, however, as economies, especially those hostile to the United States hegemony, look to alternative means for the settlement of their international transactions.

The usual approach to such a move by a hostile nation is to impose sanctions. In more severe cases, the enforcement of USD as reserve currency is carried out via outright depositions of governments, as witnessed in Libya, ongoing in Venezuela, and potentially in the early stages of taking place in Iran at the time of this writing.

The Middle Eastern nation that has a long and complicated history of conflict and American intervention stands out as a key oil supplier for China, exporting more than 20% of its crude product to the country. China, along with India, remain defiant against US-imposed sanctions, continuing to import Iranian crude oil despite the objections.

And this is just an example of where things are moving in today’s monetary environment. A growing list of nations are losing interest in accepting the settlement of international transactions in USD.

The European Union, dissatisfied with America’s unilateral withdrawal from the “Iran Nuclear Deal” or JCPOA, has gone to significant lengths to skirt around sanctions on Iranian oil by settling transactions with the country in a sort of barter-like arrangement. Russia, China, India, and Iran are leading the way in a “worldwide backlash” against the dollar, choosing other sovereign currencies and even hinting at returning to settlement in gold, instead.

This return to trusting gold and barter over fiat currencies should set off some bells for anyone who has read our previous articles in this series, where we discovered that, throughout history, economies return to hard money after experiencing failures with easy money.

Of course, the last time that nations agreed to settle international transactions in hard money, Bitcoin — the hardest money ever created that is, in many ways, superior to gold — did not exist.

In an effort to retain global currency dominance as it slowly slips away, the United States might resort to deliberately weakening their own currency against competing nations. This sort of currency manipulation is achieved via interest rate controls and money printing, using the aforementioned quantitative easing strategy.

By lowering the value of the currency, exports remain buoyant and trade surpluses can theoretically be achieved. However, this tactic often results in a “race to the bottom” as competing nations take the same approach, weakening their own currencies against each other in a downward spiral of “tit for tat”.

This approach further exacerbates the growing problems of inflation and asset bubbles that force people to turn away from trusting currencies and instead choosing to hold their wealth in stores of value that can not be controlled by central parties. Thus, the shift toward gold and eventually, Bitcoin, builds momentum.

Due to the combination of these economic forces — fractional reserve banking, quantitative easing, and currency conflict — we are witnessing the potential for a massive shift away from the easy money of fiat currency, dominated by the United States, to free market reliance on hard money, on a global scale.

In Part Four of this series, we will turn our attention to banks, and how they work – with particular attention to the extraordinary profits they command, the systematic defrauding of their customers, and the tens of billions of dollars they have paid in fines as a cost of doing their business without morality.

Letters like the 6174-A, 6173 and CP2000 have appeared in the mailboxes of cryptocurrency traders throughout the country, and the crypto tax software company that I run has seen an influx of frantic customers coming to us for tax help out of fear of penalties.

The problem here is that the IRS doesn’t have all of the necessary information. In fact, not only does it not have all the information, but the information that it does have on the cryptocurrency holders that it is sending letters to is extremely misleading. This information, which was supplied to the IRS by cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, is causing the agency to blindly and oftentimes inaccurately come after cryptocurrency traders.

Allow me to break this down further.

How is cryptocurrency taxed in the U.S.?

In many countries around the world — the U.S. included — cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are treated as property from a tax perspective, rather than as a currency. Just like other forms of property — stocks, bonds, real-estate — you incur capital gains and capital losses that need to be reported on your tax return whenever you sell, trade or otherwise dispose of your cryptocurrency.

Related: How Crypto Is Taxes in the US: A Taxpayer’s Dilemma

Pretty straightforward: If you make a bunch of money investing in Bitcoin (BTC), you have a capital gain and a tax liability that needs to be reported. If you lose a bunch of money, you have a capital loss, which will actually save you money on your tax bill — though it still needs to be reported.

It doesn’t come as a huge surprise that many enthusiasts have not been paying taxes on their cryptocurrency activity. Because of this, it actually makes a lot of sense why the IRS has started carrying out these enforcement campaigns. However, the agency is using information that is extremely misleading, and it is leading to problems. This misleading information starts with Form 1099-K.

Breaking down Form 1099-K

Cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini and others issue 1099-K’s to users who meet certain thresholds of transaction volume on their platforms. The IRS states on its website that the 1099-K is an information return used to report third-party network transactions to improve voluntary tax compliance.

In plain English, the 1099-K is used to report your gross transactions on a third-party network — in this case, a cryptocurrency exchange. This means that all of your transactions, buys, sells, transfers, etc. are summed up and reported on a 1099-K. If you meet certain thresholds — gross payments that exceed $20,000 and more than 200 such transactions — you and the IRS are both sent a copy of this 1099-K from the cryptocurrency exchange. The IRS is using these documents to monitor who is and isn’t paying taxes correctly.

These “gross transaction” reports can quickly get extremely large for high volume cryptocurrency traders. Remember, every transaction you made is being summed together on this form. I purchased $1,000 worth of Bitcoin, and then traded that Bitcoin in and out for Ether (ETH) five times, and my gross proceeds are now over $6,000 — even though I only ever “put in” $1,000 cash! This is because all “buy” transactions are added together to report gross proceeds, and in this case, I technically had six different buy transactions and six different “sell” transactions — a Bitcoin trade into ETH is considered both a buy of ETH and a sell of BTC.

You can see how this number can become extremely large for a high volume trader. At CryptoTrader.Tax, we’ve seen 1099-K’s from customers in the millions of dollars range when the trader only ever had a few thousand dollars worth of crypto.

Why this is so problematic

1099-K’s are reporting gross transaction amounts and are being sent to the government. Yet, the numbers reported are completely irrelevant when it comes to tax reporting, as you are only actually taxed on your capital gains and losses.

Again as an example, say you purchased $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in April and then sold it two months later for $9,500. You have a $500 capital loss that would be deducted from your taxable income. However, reported on 1099-K, nothing is said of your net loss; the form only tells the government that you have $19,500 of gross cryptocurrency transactions.

Ultimately, 1099-K is not a form that should be used for tax reporting purposes, yet the IRS is relying on it for enforcement. Many people often mistake the 1099-K that they receive from cryptocurrency exchanges with the typical 1099-B that they might receive from their stock broker or other investment platform outside of crypto. The 1099-B is the correct form that reports all necessary information required to calculate and accurately report capital gains and losses — including cost basis and fair market value of your investments. It’s very easy to determine your total capital gain and loss with this form, contrary to 1099-K.

The fact that the IRS is relying on 1099-K to issue action letters is problematic. Unfortunately, cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the ability to give you an accurate Form 1099-B.

Why cryptocurrency exchanges can’t provide tax reports like a stock brokerage does

Because cryptocurrency users are constantly transferring crypto into and out of their exchanges, the exchange itself has no way of knowing how, when, where or at what cost (cost basis) you originally acquired your cryptocurrencies. It only sees that they appear in your wallet on their platform.

The second you transfer crypto into or out of an exchange, that exchange loses the ability to give you an accurate report detailing the cost basis and fair market value of your cryptocurrencies, both of which are mandatory components for tax reporting. In other words, cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the ability to provide you with the necessary information to calculate your capital gains and losses. This also means that they also don’t have the ability to provide you with a 1099-B.

Coinbase itself explains to its users in its FAQs that their generated tax reports won’t be accurate if any of the following scenarios took place:

You bought or sold digital assets on another exchange.

You sent or received digital assets from a non-Coinbase wallet.

You sent or received digital assets from another exchange, including Coinbase Pro.

You stored digital assets on an external storage device.

You participated in an initial coin offering.

You previously used a method other than ”first in, first out“ to determine your gains/losses on digital asset investments

These scenarios affect millions of users.

In conclusion

The information that the IRS is receiving from cryptocurrency exchanges does not reflect your capital gains and losses whatsoever. This is problematic because these capital gains and losses are what you actually pay taxes on, not gross transaction amounts.

So, if you received a warning letter from the IRS, don’t panic. As long as you have been properly filing your cryptocurrency gains and losses on your taxes, you should be fine. The absurdly high numbers that you are seeing on these letters are often times irrelevant. Nonetheless, it is a good idea to consult a tax professional who is familiar with cryptocurrency for further help and clarification — especially if it’s an action letter.

On Sept. 14, Square Crypto, the crypto-focused branch of mobile payment company Square, took to Twitter to announce that it is providing BTCPay Foundation with a grant of $100,000 to support BTCPay Server, an open-source cryptocurrency payment processor.

BTCPay Server can allocate the funds to create anything, “as long as it’s free and open-source software that improves the security, scalability, privacy, user experience, or fungibility of Bitcoin — or all of the above.” The Square Crypto team added:

“BTCPay represents everything we love about open-source bitcoin projects. It exemplifies the ideals of our community and promotes adoption by letting merchants accept bitcoin, control their private keys, and self-validate their coins. It also creates powerful real world applications for bitcoin without sacrificing user experience or requiring trusted third parties.”

Square Crypto went on to explain why they are giving a “bunch of money” to BTCPay Server, a product that appears to be in direct competition with its own services. Square explained:

“Existing payments companies have a choice to make: adapt or be left behind. This isn’t an investment in a competitor, it’s an investment in the future of money — something that Square obviously has a stake in.”

Prime brokerage firms are coming for crypto in what’s likely to be a race of winner-takes-almost-all. Goldman Sachs is synonymous with institutional wealth and power, even to those who’ve never purchased a financial product in their life. Like the eponymous tower it occupies in Jersey City, Goldman Sachs dominates the prime brokerage trade. What will happen when crypto gains its own Goldman Sachs – an institutional investment company whose AUM grant it unprecedented sway?

Prime Brokerage Is Coming for Crypto

Prime brokerage is a term that’s synonymous with financial markets, but never with crypto. Used to describe the sort of bundled services that investment banks offer, it has little application to the cryptosphere, because there are no bitcoin investment banks. At least not in the traditional sense. For all its innovation, however, crypto has a habit of borrowing from the world it was meant to have deviated from. Think custodial services for cold storage of digital assets, which evoke banks with their dusty vaults and safety deposit boxes; or consider annualized interest from defi platforms that mirrors that once offered by personal savings accounts. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

It should come as no surprise, therefore, to learn that HNW individuals will soon have their own all-in-one firms willing to manage their wealth across a range of verticals, altcoins, blockchains, and sectors. If you’re willing to trust a third party to custody your crypto – as many investors are – you might as well trust them to invest your assets into the bargain, putting them to use in a manner that will generate the best return. It’s a world away from the financially sovereign one that Satoshi and Hal Finney envisaged, but then a lot has changed in Bitcoin in a decade.

The Quest to Become the Goldman Sachs of Crypto

Troy Trade is one company eyeing the lucrative prime brokerage market, with the sort of all-in-one service that will be familiar to traditional investors: institutional-grade trading, including margin and OTC, together with quant strategies, and a suite of dynamic data tools. Having secured $10 million in funding from the likes of Block VC and Consensus Labs, Troy is now promising institutional investors direct market access to all tier-one exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and Bitfinex.

Newcomers such as Troy will face competition from several of the same exchanges whose liquidity they’re tapping into. In the last two years, virtually every major U.S. and global exchange has courted institutional investors through laying on services such as custody and OTC, and slashing trading fees for high volume traders. Binance and Huobi have made significant headway in provisioning turnkey services tailored to the needs of institutional investors, but have struggled to shed their reputation as retail trading venues. It’s one thing to offer a suite of services under one roof; it’s another to successfully be all things to all people simultaneously, as the needs of distinct investor groups are very different.

What Institutional Investors Are Looking For

In crypto, as in traditional finance, institutional investors are seeking certain provisions before they’ll bring their money, and that of their clients, to the table. These include:

Deep liquidity

Advanced trading interface

Sophisticated data analytics

High speed order execution

Competitive rates and trading fees

Wide range of quantitative solutions

This latter caveat is particularly important, as institutional traders demand more comprehensive and sophisticated datasets from which to base their trading decisions. This includes detailed historical data, plus tools to facilitate the construction of proprietary trading systems. In addition, low latency, to maximize the performance of high frequency trading algorithms, is a must.

Looking around the cryptosphere, there aren’t many companies that can meet these sorts of demands. When reputable exchanges such as Kraken are experiencing $4,000 wicks, like the example below, it’s safe to say that institutional-grade liquidity still isn’t there, or at the very least, it’s beyond the reach of any single exchange right now.

Holy shit at Kraken.

This is the biggest holy cross yet.

Candles of this extremity are unusual, it’s true, but their very existence shows that the cryptosphere still has work to do before it can open for business to the big boys. Combining the liquidity of multiple exchanges, as brokerage services such as Troy Trade, Tagomi, and Caspian are doing, is a start, but institutional demands run deeper. What they’re really seeking is a prime broker they can trust, and that’s something which can’t be bought or acquired by plugging in to the trust of others. It will take time and flawless service for any of the emerging institutional brokers to become crypto’s own Goldman Sachs. Until then, expect to see intense competition among crypto brokers and established exchanges to woo Wall Street.

What Prime Brokerage Will Do for Crypto

The rise of prime brokerage firms may be good for institutional investors, but what will it mean for the rest of the market?

Lower volatility: When Cboe and CME launched BTC futures in late 2017, the talk was of big money “taming” bitcoin, but as history has shown, bitcoin doesn’t like being told what to do. As more money enters the market from institutional coffers, some of the intra-day moves should be flattened out, but lower volatility should not be mistaken for low volatility. This bronco will still buck.

Greater protection: Bitcoin, to all practical intents and purposes, cannot be killed. As such, it doesn’t need institutional investors to park their wealth in it to prevent the U.S. government from overregulating it. That said, the deeper crypto roots itself into the financial system, the harder it will be to weed out. By the time it’s a trillion-dollar asset class, the Federal Reserve and the IMF can bump their gums all they like – crypto won’t be going anywhere.

New products: Why trade an asset when you can trade derivatives of it, gaining exposure without the risk of custody? It won’t be retail investors who drive the innovation of new synthetic instruments for trading BTC, ETH, BCH, and other leading assets. The demand for new crypto derivatives will come from institutional investors, and as synthetic assets catch on, more money will flow into crypto. At the moment, there are limits on what you can do with bitcoin as an institutional investor, save for going long or short and playing around with leverage. Expect more levers to be added in future, and more complexity added, for the benefit of sophisticated traders with an appetite for such things.

For retail investors seeking a means to buy and sell cryptocurrency, platforms such as exchange.Bitcoin.com are more than up to the task. Institutional investors, however, tend to demand more bespoke solutions. For these entities, prime brokerages are the answer. The question is, which broker will be the first to step up and claim that crown?

The high inflation figures for altcoins like ZCash (ZEC) and XRP are providing yet another basis for the “bitcoin is king” argument.

Indiscriminate Dumping Hurting Altcoin Value

Tweeting on Friday (September 13, 2019), economic and crypto analyst, Alex Krüger highlighted the relationship between high inflation figures and poor price performance for certain altcoins.

Crypto inflation rates, as measured by @viewbasecom. There is a disproportionate percentage of $ZEC and $XRP pouring into the market.

Krüger’s tweet was based on figures published ViewBase — a platform that provides information on ‘coin’ dumps.

Whether by fixed or fluctuating schedules, altcoins like ZEC and XRP are showing significantly higher inflation figures. ZEC, for example, currently has an annualized inflation rate of more than 35%.

More than 7,000 ZEC tokens are ‘minted’ per day. This figure amounts to about 0.098% dilution of the circulating supply, much higher than cryptos with daily coin additions via mining.

Earlier in the year, Zcsh disclosed an inflation bug that was capable of creating an infinite number of tokens.

On the fixed inflation end of the spectrum, Ripple releases 1 billion XRP every quarter. XRP has an annualized inflation of close to 30%.

As previously reported by Bitcoinist, some XRP proponents have expressed displeasure with the constant dumping of the token by Ripple.

Earlier in the week, the company transferred 100 million XRP (about $26 million) to former CTO Jed McCaleb sparking fears of more sell-offs.

Bitcoin is Separate from the Rest

For bitcoin, the situation is completely different, with the top-ranked cryptocurrency sporting an inflation rate of 3.97%.

After the 2020 halving, this figure will be cut in half taking bitcoin’s inflation even lower than the current Federal Reserve interest rate.

Compared to bitcoin’s lean inflation figures, altcoins like ZEC and XRP seem like penny stocks whose value is constantly declining.

Bitcoin is up more than 170% since the start of the year while ZEC and XRP have moved over 25% in the opposite direction.

Together, XRP and ZEC are among some of the worst-performing cryptos of 2019. Altcoins, in general, have endured a miserable 2019, continuing the pains for bag holders from 2018’s bear market.

Meanwhile, commentators are calling a new all-time high (ATH) for bitcoin before the end of 2019. The emerging consensus is that the price action for the top-ranked crypto has entered another zone of parabolic advance.

Thus, a move for BTC towards its previous ATH would mean a further leg-up that could go as high as $30,000 in 2021.

Do you think the massive inflation seen in XRP and ZEC points to poor ‘tokenomics?’ Let us know in the comments below.

Coinme Is Planning to Expand into European, Central and South American Markets

The capital raised will also be used to creating online wallets for retail investors, so that they can use digital currencies for making remittance payments or conducting other types of transactions.

In statements shared with Coindesk, the company’s co-founder and CEO Neil Bergquist noted that Coinme has been approved to operate Bitcoin ATMs in 29 US states. The financial services firm will be applying for additional licenses in the future.

Founded in 2014, Coinme’s management is also planning to enter the European, Central and South American markets, given the high rate of adoption of cryptocurrencies in these regions, Bergquist said.

Xpring (pronounced “spring”) is Ripple’s developer initiative that builds infrastructure and assists blockchain startups by helping them acquire capital and enter strategic partnerships. Xpring focuses on projects that utilize and build solutions for XRP and the XRP Ledger.

The initiative’s main goal is to build a community of developers, businesses and firms that believe blockchain networks, particularly the XRP Ledger, will dramatically improve the operational efficiency of major industries.

Bergquist revealed that Coinme raised $4.5 million in its previous funding rounds, which included $3.5 million in convertible debt, coming partly from Washington-based Coinstar over the past few years, and another $1.5 million from a venture fund in 2017.

Coinme has over 2,500 locations, and services the world’s largest Bitcoin kiosk network. The company initially began as a Bitcoin trading platform in 2014, and then expanded its services by working with Coinstar’s coin-to-cash machines.

Almost a Five-Fold Increase in the Number of Active Bitcoin ATMs Since 2017

The Coinstar kiosks let users exchange paper bills and coins for up to $2,500 in cryptocurrency, by sending a code to their mobile phones after they’ve made a deposit at one of the company’s machines.

The partnership between Coinstar and Coinme was announced earlier this year. The crypto kiosks have been installed mostly in public locations such as supermarkets.

Coin ATM Radar data reveals that since 2017, there’s been almost a five-fold increase in the number of active Bitcoin ATMs. During the summer months of this year, Bitcoin ATM LibertyX crossed 1,000 kiosks under service.

In addition to crypto kiosks, Coinme offers concierge trading, high-volume transactions for large investors, and digital asset retirement options, including a 401(k) and a self-directed IRA.

“We are proud to be the first regulated cryptocurrency index provider to meet the EU BMR’s stringent requirements. [...] Reliable and trusted benchmarks are critical to growing the cryptocurrency ecosystem as they attract more individual and institutional investors to the asset class.”

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, major United States stock exchange Nasdaq has unveiled a decentralized blockchain finance index called Defix (DEFX).",,https://decrypt.co/9246/the-future-of-crypto-banking-switzerland,"Stefan Deiss, founder and CEO of the Swiss crypto accelerator, Blockchain Propulsion, spent two months looking for a bank account for Polo Pecem, the world’s first blockchain-powered “Smart Chain City,” one of the companies under his wing. “That’s a long time in the life of a startup,” he said to Decrypt.

That’s why Deiss, and countless others, are cheering the launch of Switzerland’s two new crypto asset banks, Zug-based Seba and Zurich-based Sygnum. The crypto banks, which are aiming to serve asset managers, regular banks and startups, will now be regulated, just like other financial institutions. In August, the Swiss regulator, FINMA, granted Seba and Sygnum provisional banking and securities licenses.They are the first such licenses granted anywhere in the world, and will enable the banks to integrate cryptocurrency into a wide range of services—deposits, withdrawals, lending and investing.

Perhaps most important, they will fill the void in banking services for crypto traders and entrepreneurs, who are regularly denied and locked out of bank accounts because of the risky reputation of crypto companies.

Dedicated crypto banks are nearly here

“It’s a great move for Switzerland, but also for other countries around the world, because now you have banks that are specialized in crypto,” said Deiss.

Blockchain Propulsion has hubs around the world. It helps its startups raise capital, and can help domicile clients who operate in less favorable jurisdictions in Switzerland. But Deiss hasn’t yet decided which of the two new crypto banks to recommend to his clients. Neither Seba nor Sygnum has yet been permitted to publish its prospectus.

Once they’re fully licensed, which is expected within a month, they’ll be able to issue, store, trade and manage cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, and convert fiat currencies to crypto. They could also offer custody, brokerage and tokenization services for digital assets to qualified investors and institutions.

The provisional award has opened the floodgates for other companies in the region, such as veteran crypto financial services provider, Bitcoin Swiss, which is now hoping its applications to become digital will be accepted. However, the process is lengthy.

“What’s important is that Switzerland is able to maintain its advantage in the crypto/blockchain sphere,” he added.

Europe’s crazy quilt of regulations

Switzerland has been one of the main players leading the global adoption of tokenized digital assets and DLT. Indeed, Europes banking hub is also preparing to host Libra, the digital currency proposed by Facebook. Some say it threatens to upend the very foundations of the world’s banking system.

But competitors have been biting at its heels.

Germany, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg have all taken steps towards adopting distributed ledger tech, but none has yet licensed a dedicated crypto bank.

The tiny nation of Malta, keen to become “blockchain island,” has been busy introducing legislation that favors crypto companies, but its startups are finding it hard to obtain banking services.

To remedy this, Malta-registered RnF Finance, founded by former Agribank CEO Roderick Psaila and backed by the OkEx exchange, applied to the Maltese financial regulator for a license at the end of last year. If granted, the permit would allow it to perform a range of financial activities, including lending, payment and custodian services.

But, as yet, the Maltese regulator has not yet issued a single licence.

“Licenses will not be something that is automatic, they will not be given out easily, it is a very robust process,” said Ian Gauci, co-founder of Malta’s Caledo agency, which provides legal, and technical services for crypto clients to help them obtain a license, told Decrypt back in May.

Unlike Switzerland, Malta is a member of the European Union, whose members must abide by common rules governing the movement of goods and services. And there are signs that within the E.U., regulatory noose around cryptocurrencies is tightening.

January 2020 is the deadline for members to enact the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive and many countries have used the legislation to beef up their regulations and make them even tougher than the directive requires.

In Germany, for instance, digital asset exchanges and providers of crypto payment and custodian services must now apply for licenses from the financial regulator, potentially limiting services that have so far been readily available to the crypto community.

Banks are hooking up with with crypto firms

But partnering with a bank can be a way for crypto companies to cut through the red tape, and offers advantages for banks too.

Pioneering German crypto bank Bitwala partnered with European Union-regulated SolarisBank in October 2018, a move that ensures its account holders are able to use Bitwala’s services just like a regular bank account—to pay bills, exchange currencies, and send interbank payments. It also means that, just as with Germany’s traditional banks, deposits of up to €100,000 ($110,000) are protected by the German Deposit Guarantee Scheme.

“Bitwala was first to offer a fully compliant and convenient banking service as a bridge for everyone,” Christoph Iwaniez, the startup’s Chief Finance Officer told Decrypt. “We believe that more services around blockchain-based financial services will follow. This is, in our opinion, the most promising way to open the cryptosphere for mass adoption.”

In August, Bitwala launched the first mobile, bitcoin banking app on iOS and Android. The app combines a bank account, bitcoin wallet, and a trading and debit card. Its innovative features include the ability to sign off on transactions with biometric identification.

Iwaniez argues that most, if not all, traditional banks “are clearly lagging way behind in the technical development in blockchain technologies.” And it’s only through partnering with crypto firms that they can close the technology gap and gain know-how as well as access to the crypto markets and the community. Better regulation, he believes, will not be a hindrance, it will be the trigger.

Banks are now more likely to seek partnerships with licensed crypto banks, rather than trying to transform themselves into crypto banks, said Diess. Private, Swiss investment bank Julius Berne, which recently partnered with Seba, is a case in point.

“Now that you have two specialized crypto banks opening up soon, the traditional banks are probably not going to be called on to open up accounts for crypto companies,” he said, speculating that “it is too late in the game” for legacy banks to get into crypto themselves.

Still, there’s little doubt that banking will start to incorporate blockchain in banking services, according to Anne Boden, a doyen with 30 years experience in some of the world’s most important financial institutions, and founder and CEO of “challenger bank” UK-based Starling,

But she added that banking is an industry of such magnitude, which is so legacy-based, that it would be foolhardy to overhaul the entire system for a nascent technology.

The U.S. is lacking in short-term plans

Despite calls from the IMF, among others, that central banks should innovate to avoid being left behind, the American financial sector has fewer short-term plans to build out the new types of money-transfer systems like those that are being developed in Europe and beyond.

But the U.S. Federal Reserve is mindful of the threat posed by upstart banks that have gained strong momentum. In August, it announced plans to launch its own fintech real-time payments system “FedNow” within five years. The idea has been slammed by experts, including the Bitcoin-friendly former congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul.

The U.S. has gained a reputation for strict regulations, and strict punishments for projects that fall afoul of the rules. Yet the New York Department of Financial Services—arguably the strictest regulator in the world—has, since 2018, allowed some cryptocurrency companies to offer bank-like services.

And there’s now a new and growing class of financial instruments surging in popularity in the U.S.

DeFi services are increasingly mimicking banking

In particular, investors have been crying out for solutions that will balance security and the ability to quickly move crypto assets for trade. To meet growing demand, the lines have been blurring between fintech banking, cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets. And some of the largest crypto firms, such as the Coinbase exchange, have been able to offer bank-like services for enterprise-level businesses.

Coinbase Custody provides those with large crypto holdings with services including segregated cold storage, integration with the Coinbase Pro exchange, insurance for deposits, staking tools, customized reporting and third-party auditing. In August, Coinbase announced that it was beefing up the business and buying the ""custody"" arm of rival Xapo, in a bid to attract big investors, such as hedge fund managers and mutual fund managers.

But, essentially, it’s an investment fund. It can only play at banking until the Securities and Exchange Commission grants it leave to integrate with the banking system. Meanwhile, it falls under the remit of the New York Department of Financial Services.

DeFi is not banking. It’s unable to offer the security that banks are valued for. But in the absence of other alternatives, increased competition among these quasi-banks has led to new ways to store assets.

Similar custodian services are offered by Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup Anchorage and Fidelity Digital Assets, and, on Tuesday, the Winklevoss-owned Gemini exchange entered the fray, announcing Gemini Trust, a custodian service which will allow users to instantly trade 18 types of cryptocurrencies from offline storage.

In Germany too, custody solutions, are increasingly in the spotlight. Moves, by the German regulator, to license crypto companies offering these types of services, were discussed at its BaFin Tech 2019 conference in Berlin on Wednesday.

But DeFi is not just about custody, it also offers plenty of other ideas to reshape banking, lending, and derivatives. It will be especially valuable in emerging economies where people are already using crypto to hedge against local fiat currency fluctuations, said Iwaniez.

Crucially, those who might be turned away by traditional banks will now have another alternative; they need no longer go, cap in hand, to a traditional bank if they need financing. And integrated economies with the most liberal banking authorities will benefit most.

Mindful of this fact, U.S. officials this week pressed Swiss regulator to ensure that its regulations are robust enough to withstand abuse. But on Thursday, FINMA head Mark Branson told the Swiss paper Neue Zuercher Zeitung he was ready for the challenge:

“If a financial center has ambitions, it must be able to live with attention,” he said. It’s certainly going to get a lot of that in the coming days.",2019-09-14 14:08:34,,,,,,

Most of us think we understand the term “volatility.”

We digest headlines about tense political situations around the world; we are wary of explosive chemical compounds; some of us have had relationships with their fair share of ups and downs.

“Volatility” implies sharp and unpredictable changes, and usually has negative connotations. Even when it comes to financial markets, we intuitively shy away from investments that would produce wild swings in our wealth.

But volatility, in finance, is usually misunderstood. Even the most commonly accepted calculation is often incorrectly applied.

Its desirability is also confusing. Investors hate it unless it makes them money. Traders love it unless it means too high a risk premium.

And few of us understand where it comes from. Many think that it’s the result of low liquidity*. This intuitively makes sense: with thin trading volume, a large order can push prices sharply up or down. But empirical studies show that it’s actually the other way around: volatility leads to low liquidity, through the wider spread market makers apply to compensate the additional risk of holding a volatile asset in their inventory.

(*The misconception also stems from our mistaken conflation of low liquidity and low volume – it is possible to have high volume and low liquidity, but that’s for another post.)

This confusion matters in the crypto sector.

Bitcoin’s volatility has often been cited as the reason why it will never make a good store of value, a reliable payment token or a solid portfolio hedge. Many of us fall into the trap of assuming that as the market matures, volatility will decrease. This leads us to believe in use cases that may not ever be appropriate; it can also lead us to apply incorrect crypto asset valuation methods, portfolio weightings and derivative strategies that could have a material impact on our bottom line.

So it’s worth picking apart some of the assumptions and looking at why bitcoin’s unique characteristics can help us better understand market fundamentals more broadly.

Changing uncertainty

First, there are different types of market volatility. Academic literature provides an array of variations, each with its distinct formula and limitations. Jump-diffusion models used to value assets hint at a helpful differentiation. “Jump” volatility results, as its name implies, from a sudden event. “Diffuse” volatility, however, is part of the standard trading patterns of an asset, its “usual” variation.

With this we can start to see that, when we assume that greater liquidity will dampen price swings, we’re talking about “jump” volatility.

“Diffuse” volatility, however, is a more intrinsic concept.

The standard deviation calculation – the most commonly applied measure of volatility – incorporates the destabilizing effect of sharp moves by using the square of large deviations (otherwise they could be offset and masked by small ones). But this exaggerates the effect of outliers, which are often the result of “jump” volatility. These are likely to diminish as transaction volume grows, leading to a misleadingly downward-sloping volatility graph.

JP Koning proposes an alternative calculation that uses the deviation from the middle value rather than the average, which reduces the effect of outliers and shows a more intrinsic volatility measure. As the below chart shows, this has not noticeably decreased over the years.

Now let’s look at why this might be. A clue lies in the methods used to value bitcoin.

Fundamental value

Bitcoin is one of the few “real assets” traded in markets today, in that it does not derive its value from another asset.

What’s more, it is a “real asset” with no discernible income stream. This makes it very difficult to value. Even junior analysts can calculate the “fair value” of an asset that spins off cash flows or that returns a certain amount at the end of its life. Bitcoin has no cash flows, and there is no “end of life,” let alone an identifiable value.

So, what drives the value of bitcoin?

Many theories have been put forward, some of which we describe in our report “Crypto’s New Fundamentals.” And as the market evolves, some may rise in favor while others get forgotten or superseded.

For now, though, the main driver of bitcoin’s value is sentiment: it’s worth what the market thinks it’s worth. In the absence of fundamentals, investors try to figure out what other investors are going to think. Keynes likened this to a contest in which “we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.”

Gold is in a similar situation, in that it is also a “real asset” with no income stream and a market value largely driven by sentiment.

So, why is its volatility so much lower?

Because of “radical uncertainty.”

Changing narratives

In his book “The End of Alchemy”, Mervyn King explains that under “radical uncertainty,” market prices are determined, not by fundamentals, but by narratives about fundamentals.

Bitcoin is a new technology, and as such, we don’t yet know what its end use will be. Everyone has their theory, but as with all new technologies, no-one can be certain, which makes its narrative changeable.

Gold, on the other hand, is neither new nor a technology. It has been around for millennia, and its narrative is not uncertain. Sentiment plays an important part in its valuation, and scientists may yet uncover an innovative use for the metal that affects both demand and price. But its “story” is well established, which gives it a lower volatility profile.

For now, bitcoin’s fundamentals are its narrative, and the uncertainty about bitcoin’s “story” means that its volatility is unlikely to diminish any time soon.

A more prominent role

This matters for its eventual use case: will it always be too volatile to be used as a payment token, store of value, etc.? This in turn impacts its narrative, which affects its valuation and volatility, which affects its eventual use case. The self-perpetuating loop will eventually be broken as the sector matures and bitcoin’s role as an alternative asset class becomes more firmly consolidated – when uncertainty diminishes and its “intrinsic value” becomes easier to quantify.

But until then, its price will continue to be driven by market sentiment, which is susceptible to changeable narratives that in turn are formed by global developments and also by market sentiment.

Until then, market shifts will continue to be amplified in either direction, whatever the trading volume.

Rather than fret about this, we should accept and even embrace it. Increasingly sophisticated providers are working on improving the access to and interpretation of sentiment data, which strengthens our analytical tools. Crypto Twitter provides an engrossing platform to gauge the sector’s mood. And the identification of the impact of narrative and sentiment on an asset class will open up new avenues of investigation that is likely to spill over into other areas of investing.

What’s more, volatility may be inconvenient for some and uncomfortable for many. But it is also an important component of superior returns. Perhaps the tools and skills we develop to hone our bitcoin valuation techniques will enable a more masterful handling of volatility’s inherent uncertainty, and allow for a deeper appreciation of what it has to offer.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Europe should consider a European public digital currency to counter the Libra.

However, Bertrand Perez, the director general of the Libra Association, stated that the company will satisfy all regulatory requirements and that Libra might launch in the second half of 2020. He said that Libra does not aim to create new money supply, hence, it will not destabilize the fiat currencies that are a part of its basket.

United States Treasury Undersecretary Sigal Mandelker has said that terrorist organizations and their supporters are looking at new ways of raising and transferring funds to evade tracking by law enforcement agencies. She stressed the need to establish a system that will prevent illicit finance in crypto for the United States to work with governments to ensure that “non-compliant networks and fintechs do not survive.”

With sustained pressure from regulators, let’s take a look at this week’s top performers and see what their charts project.

ATOM/USD

Cosmos (ATOM) has been a huge outperformer in the past seven days as it has risen over 34%. The rally has helped it climb back into the top-20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Can it continue its stellar run or will it give up some of its recent gains? Let’s analyze the chart.

Due to a short trading history, we are analyzing the daily chart on the ATOM/USD pair. It hit a lifetime low of $1.9101 on Sept. 5, from where the recovery has been strong. This shows that bulls have used the dip to buy aggressively. After more than an 80% rally within 10 days, the price has now reached the previous support-turned-resistance of $3.6043.

The recovery might face some resistance at this level but once it is crossed, a move to $4.4389 and above it to $5.7961 is possible. The moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover, which indicates a likely change in trend.

Any dip from current levels is likely to find support at the upsloping 20-day EMA. Our bullish view will be invalidated if bears sink the price below $2.40. If that happens, a retest of the lows is possible. The traders can wait for a pullback to the 20-day EMA before initiating long positions.

EOS/USD

A hacker exploited a bug in the EOS gambling game EOSPlay to steal over $110,000 in cryptocurrency. The hack did not freeze the network, but it caused an overload due to which “there was just no extra bandwidth available for free use,” according to Daniel Larimer, the CTO at Block.One. However, this event did not affect the price as the cryptocurrency was the second-best performer of the past seven days. The upcoming hard fork on Sept. 23, the largest upgrade to the network since it was launched, has kept sentiment bullish, but what do the technicals projec

The bulls are attempting to push the EOS/USD pair above the descending channel. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the channel will indicate a possible change in trend. However, above the channel, the pair is likely to face stiff resistance at both moving averages and above it at $4.8719.

Once the price ascends $4.8719, it will signal the start of a new uptrend that can result in a move back to $8.6503. The traders can initiate long positions as we recommended in the previous analysis.

If the bulls fail to scale $4.8719, the cryptocurrency might remain range-bound for a few more days. Our bullish assumption will be negated if the price turns down from any of the overhead resistance levels and plummets below $3.1534. Below this level, a drop to $2.20 and below it to $1.55 is possible.

ETH/USD

Spanish bank Banco Santander issued a $20 million bond, the first end-to-end blockchain bond, on the Ethereum blockchain. Santander Corporate and Investment Banking said that the whole transaction was faster, simpler and more efficient.

With positive technical news on the Ethereum network, let’s see what the charts project for Ether (ETH).

The ETH/USD pair is attempting to bounce after hitting $163.755 the week before. It has risen above the 50-week SMA and will now attempt to rise above the 20-week EMA. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is gradually climbing back toward the midpoint, which shows a balance between buyers and sellers.

A breakout of the 20-week EMA will be a positive sign that will shift the advantage in favor of the bulls. Above $235.70 the recovery can reach the critical overhead resistance of $320.84.

However, if the price turns down from the 20-week EMA or $235.70 and plunges below $163.755, it will signal weakness.

DASH/USD

Coinbase Pro announced that it will add support for the Dash (DASH) token next week. The professional trading platform will accept DASH deposits for 12 hours before full trading begins. Dash also received support from Brazilian cryptocurrency exchange NovaDAX and cryptocurrency payments merchant solution PumaPay. These positive developments have kept the cryptocurrency among the top five performers for the second straight week. Can it continue its run? Let’s analyze the chart.

The pullback in the DASH/USD pair is facing selling at the previous support-turned-resistance of $95.4264. Above this level, the bulls will again hit a roadblock at the downsloping moving averages. If the price breaks out of the moving averages, it is likely to turn positive and rally to $162 and above it to $188.5598.

However, if the pair turns down either from $95.4264 or from the moving averages and plummets below the recent lows of $77.9187, it might complete a 100% retracement of the entire rally and decline to $58.49.

The gradually down-sloping moving averages and RSI in the negative territory suggests a bearish sentiment. Therefore, we will wait for the price to break out of the moving averages before suggesting a trade in it.

TRX/USD

According to Cointelegraph Analytics, Tron (TRX) is likely to release an update for the Sun Network. The Sun Network protocol aims to improve the security and efficiency of decentralized applications (DApps). The number of DApps on the Tron network continues to rise according to DAppTotal. Can the price follow higher? Let’s study its chart.

The TRX/USD pair is still struggling near the yearly lows. It is likely to face stiff resistance in the $0.016–$0.01774 zone, which had previously acted as a strong support. The 20-week EMA has turned down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that bears have the upper hand. If the price turns down from the resistance zone and dips below $0.0139038, it can retest the lows at $0.01124. A drop to new yearly lows will be a huge negative.

Conversely, if the bulls can propel the price back above the overhead resistance zone, it will indicate demand at lower levels. The pair will face resistance at the moving averages, above which it is likely to pick up momentum and move up to $0.0409111 in the medium term. We will wait for the buyers to assert their supremacy before suggesting a trade in it.

One of the largest points of contention in the Bitcoin community surrounds the question of block sizes. Larger blocks mean faster transactions and less congestion, but they have higher requirements in storage and bandwidth.

The communities behind Bitcoin and its forks are currently debating whether large blocks are truly feasible, and there is very little agreement on the matter. In fact, the Bitcoin blockchain has literally been split over this issue multiple times. Here’s a closer look at the ongoing block size debate.

A Brief History of Block Size Limits

When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2008, he didn’t introduce a block size limit. That didn’t happen until 2010, when he instituted a 1 MB limit. There was some mild debate around block sizes at that time, but the issue became increasingly pressing over the next five years as Bitcoin’s transaction volume began to climb.

At one point, the Bitcoin community planned to increase block size limits to 2MB via a hard fork in August 2017, but this hard fork was eventually cancelled. Instead, Bitcoin introduced SegWit in November 2017. Segwit handles signatures more efficiently and frees up block space, but does not actually increase block size limits—though it is sometimes said to give Bitcoin a “block weight” of 4 MB.

In any case, the controversial addition of SegWit prompted Bitcoin Cash to split off and opt for an 8 MB limit, which was later increased to 32 MB in May 2018. And history soon repeated itself: in November 2018, Bitcoin SV split away from Bitcoin Cash in order to introduce a 128 MB limit—and that limit was raised to 2 GB this July.

Do Large Blocks Provide Better Performance?

Although all three blockchains have different block size limits, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV each have roughly ten minute block times. As such, their performance is best observed indirectly. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV have near-zero fees, which suggests that users do not have to compete to get their transactions included in upcoming blocks:

However, high performance may be partially due to low demand rather than large block sizes. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV rarely approach full block capacity, and on a typical day, their average block sizes are much lower than those found on Bitcoin. Additionally, both blockchains have much lower transaction volumes than Bitcoin, as shown below.

There are outliers, of course. Bitcoin Cash’s stress tests show that its network is capable of handling a high volume of transactions and large blocks – this month, a 14 MB block containing 73,000 transactions was mined. Coin Geek, meanwhile, has demonstrated that 128 MB blocks can be mined on Bitcoin SV– although in practice such large blocks are harder to propagate through the network.

If Bitcoin Cash and BSV ever start to consistently handle full blocks, their large size limits should benefit their performance. It should be noted that these blockchains do not need to attract more transactions to fill their blocks: Bitcoin SV, for example, aims to store large media files on chain. (Whether this feature is actually necessary is another debate.)

Do Large Blocks Harm Security and Decentralization?

There is one major concern around increasing block size: large blocks could reduce network security. Large blocks require nodes to dedicate more resources and bandwidth, making node operation an expensive commitment. This could cause nodes to leave the network, centralizing the blockchain in question and leaving it vulnerable to attack.

It’s also possible that some networks will be unable to keep up with large blocks. BitMEX, for instance, detected a “reorg” on Bitcoin SV in April. This means that Bitcoin SV miners were unable to propagate and verify large blocks before another block was found. Bad actors didn’t take advantage of this issue, but it was a security risk.

Fortunately, some projects are aiming to make it easier for nodes and miners to handle large blocks. Flowee the Hub, for example, recently demonstrated (on a test chain) that 250 MB Bitcoin Cash blocks can be mined and verified by low-memory nodes. This is just one of Flowee’s many initiatives to lighten the burden of large blocks.

Denial-of-service attacks are another issue, as SFOX has explained here. If bad actors create large blocks, they could induce massive backlogs. Of course, attackers could attempt a DOS attack by sending a high volume of small transactions as well. Ultimately, Bitcoin has many anti-DOS measures, and block sizes are just one factor at play.

Taking Scalability In Other Directions

Block sizes might be a hot topic in Bitcoin communities, but they’re not a problem for all blockchains. Ethereum, for example, uses gas limits instead of block size limits. The ETH network has had its own issues with transaction backlogs and overloads, but its gas limits are not as contentious as block sizes, as they can be adjusted relatively easily.

Even when it comes to Bitcoin and related blockchains, there are other scalability efforts underway. Second-layer solutions like the Lightning Network can be used to perform transactions off-chain. On-chain scaling features like Xthinner, Graphene, and Compact Blocks also reduce the need for larger blocks on Bitcoin and related blockchains.

It’s also important to note that block sizes are trending upward right now, but that trend could conceivably be reversed. Some parts of the Bitcoin community are currently pushing for smaller, 300 KB blocks. As new scalability methods are found, the debate over large blocks might quiet down—and efficient data handling could make more noise.

Correction: a previous version of this article claimed that Segwit2X had been activated and that Bitcoin supported 2 MB blocks. Currently, only SegWit is activated, and Bitcoin only supports 1 MB blocks.",2019-09-15 17:39:47+00:00,https://micky.com.au/no-warning-westpac-closes-1m-crypto-business-bank-account/,"Aussie banks seem to think crypto is too hot to handle – but what’s the real reason behind the constant closure of crypto related accounts?

Two weeks ago, Rewards4U co-founder David Jenkins received a letter out of the blue from Westpac saying their business bank account containing more than $1 million will be closed on September 30.

The letter provided no reasons for the closure of the account.

“It’s pretty clear they’re targeting us for our crypto related activities, so we’ve made a formal complaint to the financial ombudsman,” Jenkins said.

“Obviously we cant stand up in court and say this is why they did it, but why would you shut a business down with $1m in its account unless you thought they might become competition at some stage?” he asked.

Banned from the related banks too

The account closure also means Rewards4U is effectively black banned from Westpac’s related businesses: St George, Bank of Melbourne, Bank SA, BT Financial Group and Rams.

Rewards4U is an Australian startup that uses tokens in place of traditional loyalty points.

It’s being trialed out at 40 businesses on the Gold Coast, and enables users to spend their tokens at a variety of businesses.

The RWDS token currently trades on three exchanges: P2PB2B, Xrates and BTCEXA.

Too legit to quit

Rewards4U did not conduct an ICO, however it is registered with AUSTRAC and is a member of both Blockchain Australia (ADCA) and the World Blockchain Chamber of Commerce.

“We are compliant with all AML/CTF requirements through Rapid ID … we’ve never had any financial or other compliance issues since inception,” he said.

Most crypto businesses in Oz have similar issues

The majority of cryptocurrency related businesses in Australia have reported trouble securing or keeping bank accounts including major exchanges such as Coinspot, which was forced to suspend Australian dollar deposits in early 2018 as a result

In January this year MyCryptoWallet was crippled after National Australia Bank unexpectedly closed its accounts, forcing it to suspend withdrawals.

(Incidentally, MCW users on Twitter report the exchange is still have many issues with withdrawals – CEO Jaryd Koenigsmann told Micky today that not all users were affected and the company was “still with our lawyers regarding this situation and we will be able to provide more information mid October.”)

Bitcoin Babe also reports being been banned from dozens of Banks and many other users have had their accounts frozen after sending money to cryptocurrency exchanges.

But Westpac says crypto is OK, within reason

Westpac’s official position is that: “We do not restrict use of accounts in relation to cryptocurrency as long as the use complies with our legal obligations and terms and conditions.”

The bank is also involved with blockchain and cryptocurrency: it is listed as a customer of Ripple and it participated in the Lygon blockchain bank guarantee project trial in July.

Westpac has also put $150 million in its Reinventure division which in turn has invested in projects including Coinbase.

“They’re cahoots with Coinbase, so that’s crypto related,” said Jenkins. “Which is really weird. We’re being shut down for exactly the thing they are promoting.”

Former banker gives opinion

Former ANZ and Westpac banker Rod Tasker – now a management consultant with a keen interest in blockchain – said there’s no big conspiracy behind the major banks’ reluctance to provide services to crypto related businesses.

“I think it’s more to do with AML/CTF (anti money laundering/counter terrorism financing) at the moment than anything else really,” he said.

“It’s one of those things where the risk, and the fines for breaching money laundering laws, are so large – millions of dollars – it’s not worth the risk from a banks’ point of view.

“The issue is if something happens outside your sphere of control you can still be liable for it in an AML/CTF sense so it’s easier to rule that whole segment out.”

Not sure that adds up any more

Jenkins said that may have been a reasonable position in the past but his company now has to comply with a 180 page AML/CTF manual – and has contracted a respected third party specialist called RapidID to ensure the integrity of verification information.

“A year and a half ago i would have suspected something along those lines but I don’t think those arguments wash any more, I think it’s anti competitive,” he said.

Jenkins said he’d always been mindful of threat of bank account closure, and had maintained a secondary account with another bank. He’s in the processing of transferring the funds across.

“It’s going to embarrass them when we have $1 billion in their competitor’s bank account and go tell their shareholder at the AGM.

“Maybe they’ll stop their anti competitive behavior.”",2019-09-16 04:18:53+00:00,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/zscaler-innfirat-malware-cryptocurrency-wallets,40401.html","(Image credit: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock)

Movies always make robberies seem like very hands-on jobs. The wannabe thieves have to assemble their crew, scope out their chosen target's security, and then perfectly execute their plans. (Bonus points if they do so after synchronizing their watches.) It turns out there's an easier way to steal people's money, though, with the Zscaler security company revealing on Thursday new InnfiRAT malware that steals information about cryptocurrency wallets.

A quick explanation for anyone who isn't familiar with the concept: people store their Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in digital wallets. Some of these wallets are ""hot,"" which means they're connected to the internet, while their ""cold"" counterparts can only be accessed locally. The former is mostly used when someone is actively trading their coins; the latter is primarily used for long-term storage. But those are just generalizations.

Many people don't bother to store their cryptocurrency wallets on non-connected drives because it's not convenient. It can also be dangerous if someone forgets where the drive is, if the drive is destroyed or if they forget the password used to secure the drive. Fortunes can be lost if anything happens to this cold storage. Hot wallets are far more convenient, even if they're easier to compromise than their cooler, non-internet-connected counterparts.

Here's what Zscaler said about InnfiRAT's purpose:

""As with just about every piece of malware, InnfiRAT is designed to access and steal personal information on a user's computer. Among other things, InnfiRAT is written to look for cryptocurrency wallet information, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin. InnfiRAT also grabs browser cookies to steal stored usernames and passwords, as well as session data. In addition, this RAT has ScreenShot functionality so it can grab information from open windows. For example, if the user is reading email, the malware takes a screenshot. It also checks for other applications running on the system, such as an active antivirus program.""

That means pilfering cryptocurrency wallets isn't the malware's only purpose. The additional information InnfiRAT gathers could be used to access someone's bank account, for example, or similar financial services. Zscaler said RATs like this could also be used ""to perform any number of tasks, such as logging keystrokes, accessing confidential information, activating the system's webcam, taking screenshots, formatting drives, and more.""

All of the usual precautions apply to InnfiRAT. Don't open messages from untrusted senders, and if you do, refrain from downloading anything they sent along with the message. Otherwise, Zscaler said that it ""continues to monitor this threat"" to make sure its users are protected.",2019-09-15 17:40:03+00:00,,,,,,,,,,,,

With BitPay, subscribing businesses will be able to accept payments in bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ether, along with a handful of stablecoins.

Launched in 2011, BitPay now settles both fiat and crypto payments in over 200 countries.

Speaking on the addition, ethereum co-founder and creator Vitalik Buterin said it was exciting to see BitPay “leading the way in integrating ethereum into global payment systems.”

“This truly opens up a new world of possibilities for the Ethereum ecosystem, and together we can continue to be a leading innovator for real-world use cases for cryptocurrencies,” he continued.

Speaking with CoinDesk, the company said it often reviews potential cryptocurrencies for addition.

“BitPay regularly evaluates blockchains and cryptocurrencies to support the company’s goals of making it easy to send and receive payments for goods and services globally. We selected ethereum as it has broad support for real-world applications and is widely adopted.”

Narrowing it down, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said ethereum was the next logical choice due to its current market base. “As one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and one used by thousands of companies, Ethereum is the next logical choice,” he concluded.

Last week, the Hong Kong Free Press (HKFP) claimed BitPay was holding up bitcoin donations to the organization. A non-profit news organization, the HKFP has been covering the current civil unrest in the Chinese city. An official response from BitPay has yet to be released concerning the allegations.

Bitcoin price to grow with adoption

In an interview with crypto news network Blocktv on Sept. 13, the famous American venture capital investor has once again expressed his bullish stance on Bitcoin, forecasting the soon-to-come mass global adoption that will push the price of Bitcoin higher. Draper stated in the interview:

""$250,000 means that Bitcoin would then have about a 5% market share of the currency world and I think that maybe understating the power of Bitcoin.""

Bitcoin still too complex

According to Draper, people still prefer fiat money over Bitcoin so far because fiat money seems to be an easier option to pay for services. The VC billionaire argued that Bitcoin’s lack of ease of use is the main impediment to the mass adoption of cryptocurrency to date, claiming that “engineers have not made it that easy enough for everyone to use Bitcoin.”

However, in the longer term, people will have Bitcoin as the currency of choice because fiat currencies are subject to political influence due to its centralized nature and they will depreciate in value due to a natural inflation rate, Draper said.

He also reiterated his stance that Argentina will be a great market for Bitcoin as a number of local entrepreneurs tend to lose their fortune in local fiat currency due to currency manipulation and devaluation.

Still, even in countries such as the United States, people will generally want a currency that is trusted and decentralized over a currency controlled by entities like the Federal Reserve, which can be very political, Draper concluded.

Draper’s new claims follow his recent forecast that there might be a slight delay in Bitcoin’s path to a $250,000 price.

On Aug. 9, the investor predicted that the Bitcoin price will hit the threshold by Q1 2023. On Sept. 9, Draper joined the board of directors of EOS-based decentralized application firm MakeSense Labs.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/could-crypto-be-compliant-with-sharia-law-experts-answer,"The rise in popularity of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies has led to the discussion among Islamic scholars about digital currency’s compliance with Islamic canonical law.

Islamic law — known as Sharia — is based on the teachings of the Quran and includes regulations concerning financial activities, asserting them to be either “haram” (illegal) or “halal” (legal). The haram vs. halal crypto debate has been ongoing since Bitcoin's initial surge in popularity. Google searches for the phrase “Bitcoin halal” peaked in December 2017, when the leading cryptocurrency’s price hit record highs of around $20,000 per coin, while “Bitcoin haram” was queried most in January 2018.

Related: Is Bitcoin Halal? How Cryptocurrency Conforms with Islam and Sharia

Back in April 2018, an Indonesian fintech startup, released a report titled “Is Bitcoin Halal or Haram: A Sharia Analysis,” written by the company’s internal Sharia advisor, concluding that Bitcoin is generally permissible under Sharia law.

A similar idea could be found in “The Shariah Factor in Cryptocurrencies and Tokens,” issued by the Shariyah Review Bureau, licensed by the Central Bank of Bahrain, which stated that digital currencies can be Sharia-compliant “if structured correctly.”

Meanwhile, back in January 2018, Egypt’s Grand Mufti Shawki Allam — country’s top Muslim cleric — called for a ban on Bitcoin, saying the digital currency is forbidden by Islam.

After 10 years of existence, the question of whether or not Bitcoin can in fact be compliant with Sharia law continues to be debated in the industry. To see where we’re at with the debate today, we asked a variety of experts in Sharia law and finance to revisit the question. It should be noted that a lot of experts declined to give comments on such a sensitive topic.

Is Bitcoin Halal or Haram?

In the wave of technological advancement, it is an emerging era of fintech in no exception of cryptocurrency as among the fastest growing and duly appreciated financial chapters, which vibrates the global economy significantly. Ever since 2013, numerous digital currencies have been floating in cyberspace, attracting the global market in maximizing the investment opportunity for all by a smart formula with less afford, minimum banking hassle and almost zero cost, where Bitcoin so far has secured its leading platform. Though not established yet, but a mix-perception haunts the global mind that cryptocurrency is a new dimension to boost the global economy either as an alternative currency or a lead currency or a complementary currency. Nonetheless, the common assumption is that the sustainability of cryptocurrency by its significant growth with utmost appreciation ought to remain irrefutable.

The appreciation of cryptocurrency among Muslims is nothing less — particularly among the youth, who are eagerly looking forward to being involved in cryptocurrency, either through investment or establishment opportunities, dreaming of becoming smart entrepreneurs, and with no worries of depending on the traditional job market.

Yet, there is confusion clouding the mind of whether existing cryptocurrencies are justifiable under the Sharia principles and/or within the divine ethical standard. There are mixed views among Muslims and Islamic scholars, with some rejecting the idea on the grounds of garar (uncertainty) or gash (misappropriation). Some appreciate it on the ground of darurah (necessity) or tahsiniyah (prosperity), while some remain silent and are looking forward to seeing one with Sharia approvals.

To my humble understanding, conceptually the cryptocurrency is not haram. Rather, one shall be adapted and duly appreciated as an avenue for all to prosper the common economy from micro to macro in the global reality by diminishing the dependency on a debt-based economy. However, in reality, the existing phenomena of cryptocurrencies may not be treated as halal unconditionally due to some of their technical issues, operational mechanisms and legal statuses, which are not compliant with Sharia principles and ethical concerns. Among the examples are: the element of garar involved in the receiver, the fund’s movement is with no regulatory standard, insecurity for the investors (users), monopoly by no regulatory standard and no risk plan.

Therefore, to enjoy with a halal cryptocurrency, one shall be designed within the Maqasid al-Shari’ah (divine objectives) and that is: a standard Sharia-compliant regulatory standard, Sharia guidelines and policies, a Sharia supervisory body to oversee every activity within the Maqasid al-Shari’ah, avoiding any element of garar in any aspect of the establishment or operation, establishment of the receiver (company) by maintaining standard account, the operation shall be an asset-backing one with valuable existence, instruments and principles in facilitating the operation shall be justified by the Sharia (al-‘Aqd, al-Ujrah, al-Ju’alah, al-Wakalah, al-Wadiyah, al-Amanah, al-Hewalah, al-Zakat, al-Waqf and al-Tabarru’at) and social responsibility by Zakat (alms), Waqf (endowment) and Tabarru’at (charity) over the income.

This view is also shared by many contemporary Sharia scholars and economists; among them are the views expressed in the recent conference on cryptocurrency held at the Fiqh Academy, Jeddah on Sept. 10, 2019 by Sheikh Mohammed Alabdulraheem (a brilliant Islamic economist, Saudi Arabia) and Abdul Qayom (a leading Sharia scholar at the Islamic University, Madinah). For further reference, there is my recent book, “Halal Cryptocurrency Management,” which provides several solutions for a halal cryptocurrency with industrial reality, and my forthcoming book on Islamic fintech, “Realization and Industrial Solutions,” which is to be published by Palgrave MacMillan & Springer, Switzerland in 2020.

The growing phenomena of cryptocurrency, and in no exception of its halal alternative, may be promising with significant results and the future of a halal cryptocurrency may thus be anticipated to be positioned as at least a complementary currency in maximizing the opportunity as a most convenient currency for all besides enjoying smart investment opportunity and creating sustainable entrepreneuring goals within Maqasid al-Shari’ah.

Regarding the question whether cryptocurrency is halal or not, I’d say that there are currently more than 2,800 active cryptocurrencies in the market. Each of them has different characteristics, so I can’t give a general or blanket ruling on the permissibility or impermissibility of all cryptocurrencies. Some of the Sharia scholars have indeed issued fatwas and Sharia opinions like that. For example, in some countries, religious authorities have issued fatwas on the impermissibility of cryptocurrencies, like Egypt, Palestine and Turkey, and institutions like Darul Uloom Deoband in India. Interestingly, some institutions and Shariah scholars have approved cryptocurrencies, like Jamiatur Rasheed in Pakistan and Daud Bakar in Malaysia. But I’ve generally observed that the approaches taken in this regard are not holistic and deep enough. Sharia scholars need to have a comprehensive understanding and an Islamic legal characterization of cryptocurrencies before issuing any fatwa or forming a Sharia opinion on that matter.

In light of the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, I’d say that first, the term cryptocurrency is a misnomer. They should be called crypto assets because not all crypto assets are currencies; most of them lack some basic features of a currency, such as a store of value, medium of exchange and a unit of account. Hence, a coin is not the only type of crypto assets, there are other types of tokens for other purposes as well. I’ve been promoting this approach for almost three years now at the global level, and I’m happy to see that now many Sharia scholars and religious institutions have started agreeing with me on this approach.

Second, the Sharia compliance of a crypto asset depends on various factors: for example, the nature of the crypto asset itself, its issuance and distribution mechanisms, underlying projects or assets, its usage, etc. Other external factors are also very important in determining the permissibility or impermissibility of such assets. After doing research for a few years, I have created a comprehensive framework and criteria to check whether a crypto asset is Sharia compliant or not. Hence, each crypto asset merits a separate Islamic legal treatment and Sharia ruling.

As I mentioned before, many Sharia scholars have issued mixed fatwas and Sharia rulings based on misconceptions. It’s created confusion among Muslim participants of crypto world. That’s why the reception from this huge segment is not significant. Based on my “Sharia-screening” methodology/criteria, I have checked various crypto assets for their permissibility or otherwise — and facilitated many Muslims in actively participating in this tech revolution. Moving forward, I see that Muslim governments would be more interested in issuing their national currencies in the form of crypto assets. Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are already working on these lines. And, a sound regulatory framework would also support this phenomenon in a positive direction. Eventually, this’ll also lead Sharia scholars toward aligning their fatwas in a better way.

Atif R. Khan, managing director, Ethica Institute of Islamic Finance

In Islamic finance, deference is given to scholarly consensus on new matters such as cryptocurrency. The closest thing we have for such consensus in Islamic finance is AAOIFI, or the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, the leading standard-setting body in the industry. To date, we are not aware of an opinion from them regarding the permissibility of cryptocurrencies.

The next day, Kraken posted a Twitter thread explaining that the bug resulted from testing an unreleased advanced order type. While Bitcoin was trying to hold $10,300 mark on the day of the reported system glitch, the exchange wrote that “some clients bought from the tester at $8,000 and others sold at $12,000 without clearing the intervening liquidity” through the bug.

How widespread was the bug?

Kraken explained that the bug led to an execution on either side of the $8,000–$12,000 spread, while no liquidity was exhausted. The exchange stated that stop market orders were correctly filled at market price, and suggested that affected clients submit a support ticket.

A Kraken spokesperson subsequently told Cointelegraph that a total of around $100 was executed. The trade only happened once and could only be initiated by a specific user in the beta program. Traders who were not in the beta program passively benefited.

Kraken co-founder and CEO Jesse Powel said that the tested feature had already seen thousands of automated and human tests over several months, adding “you can’t find all the bugs all the time.” He wrote:

“Agree that matching at trade to the wrong side of the book is an exchange error. Everything that happened after that worked as expected. Trade printed, stops triggered, other orders matched just fine.”

At press time, Kraken is the 56th biggest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trading volume of $97.9 million, according to CoinMarketCap.

Lubin made his remark during a panel with Vitalik Buterin and Yoni Assia at the Ethereal Summit Tel Aviv on Sept. 15, according to live reporting from eToro analyst Mati Greenspan on Twitter.

Twin titans

To a seasoned ear, Lubin’s comment pointedly reproduces a phrase previously used by staunch Bitcoin maximalists in reference to the conceptual and technological elegance of Satoshi’s invention and to the equally shrewd choice of timing for the publication of its white paper.

His sleight of hand in extending this characterization to Ethereum’s founding could rattle the Bitcoiners’ cage, with Lubin’s tacit point preempted and contextualized by his co-panelists Assia and Buterin, the first of whom said:

“Back then [in 2013], the Bitcoin community was very maximalist and said that things like tokenization were impossible.”

To which Buterin added:

“That was very disheartening because I thought we were all on the same team. In a lot of ways though it was fine because it gave us some breathing room. Because there's already Bitcoin as a store of value but for Ethereum it gave us a more clear use case because we didn't have to try to be hard money.”

All three panelists are reported to have positioned themselves non-tribally as “decentralized protocol maximalists.”

Ether’s annunciation

Bitcoin maximalism is, especially in the current cryptocurrency market climate, alive and well — with many analysts isolating the top coin from other cryptocurrencies and focusing instead on its interaction with the traditional financial sector at a time of significant macroeconomic upheaval.

Against this somewhat fashionable signalling of the death knell for altcoins, a summer 2019 report from institutional crypto exchange San Francisco Open Exchange proposed that Ether is arguably no longer an altcoin as it “is coming into its own as a blockchain that is publicly recognized as an asset on its own terms, much like Bitcoin.”

Many cryptocurrency traders remain more skeptical, as Ether continues to hover below the $200 mark.

The European Central Bank (ECB) and a number of countries in the region have stepped up their efforts in response to Facebook’s Libra, which has revived a competing ECB project for instant payments. As Facebook engages Switzerland’s financial regulator, the ECB clarifies how Libra can be regulated under EU laws.

A Wake-Up Call and ECB’s Project Revived

Facebook’s proposed Libra digital currency has given governments worldwide a run for their money. European Central Bank board member Benoit Coeure calls Libra “a wake-up call,” after discussing it at last week’s meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Helsinki. Amid concerns over a sovereign threat, 26 regulators worldwide, including the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, reportedly met with representatives of Libra in Basel on Monday to discuss the scope and design of Libra.

Coeure told the press Friday that Libra had revived efforts of an ECB-backed project for real-time payments in the eurozone, the Target Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS). The project could allow consumers to use electronic cash, directly deposited at the ECB without the need for bank accounts, financial intermediaries or clearing counterparties. Just like with Facebook’s plans, financial intermediaries will be unnecessary in this new ECB system. “TIPS offers final and irrevocable settlement of instant payments in euro, at any time of day and on any day of the year,” the ECB described.

The project was launched last year and could last months or even years, Coeure revealed, adding that the technical feasibility remains to be seen and opposition from banks is likely. In addition, “We also need to step up our thinking on a central bank digital currency,” he suggested. France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last week that the European Union should create a common set of rules for cryptocurrencies to counter the risks posed by Libra.

Strong Opposition by France and Germany

France and Germany have reportedly agreed to block Libra due to the risks the digital currency could pose to their financial sectors, the French finance ministry said. The two countries jointly issued a statement Friday, stating:

France and Germany consider that the Libra project, as set out in Facebook’s blueprint, fails to convince that those risks will be properly addressed … We believe that no private entity can claim monetary power, which is inherent to the sovereignty of nations.

Le Maire believes that Libra should not be allowed to operate in Europe while concerns persist about sovereignty and persistent financial risks. “We encourage European central banks to accelerate work on issues around possible public digital currency solutions,” he added in the joint statement with Germany’s Finance Minister Olaf Scholz. The two countries further called on banks to work on improving European payment systems at the European level.

Swiss License for Libra, New Stablecoin Guidance

Meanwhile, the Libra Association has engaged the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma). The regulator has confirmed that the association has requested an assessment of how Finma would classify its planned Libra project including the issuance of a stablecoin under Swiss supervisory law.

Finma revealed that, based on information provided so far, such a project would fall under financial market infrastructure regulation and would require its payment system license, under the Financial Market Infrastructure Act (FMIA). The requirements under the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures would also apply to the management of cyber risks. Swiss payment systems are subject to the Anti-Money Laundering Act.

Moreover, the FMIA sets out additional requirements for services that increase the risks of a payment system. “Due to the issuance of Libra payment tokens, the services planned by the Libra project would clearly go beyond those of a pure payment system and therefore be subject to such additional requirements,” the regulator clarified, adding:

A necessary condition for being granted a licence as a payment system would be that the returns and risks associated with the management of the reserve were borne entirely by the Libra Association and not – as in the case of a fund provider – by the ‘stablecoin’ holders.

In addition, Finma has updated its stablecoin guidance, which supplements its existing guidelines for initial coin offerings (ICOs). The regulator has acknowledged the rising number of stablecoin projects since mid-2018.

Finma detailed that the requirements for stablecoins may differ based on which assets they are backed by — such as currencies, commodities, real estate or securities — and the legal rights of its holders. “Money laundering, securities trading, banking, fund management and financial infrastructure regulation can all be of relevance,” Finma elaborated.

ECB Clarifies Libra’s Regulatory Challenges

European Central Bank executive board member Yves Mersch outlined the ECB’s approach to regulating Libra earlier this month. He described some “extremely concerning” differences between Libra and other cryptocurrencies. Firstly, he explained that “Libra’s ecosystem is not only complex, it is actually cartel-like,” citing several key areas that the Libra Association will have control over the coin’s functionalities. Unlike the decentralized and disintermediary nature of cryptocurrencies, he said that “similarly to public money Libra will actually be highly centralized, with Facebook and its partners acting as quasi-sovereign issuers of currency.”

Mersch raised several concerns regarding Libra such as its lack of a global lender of last resort and the limited liability of the Libra Association members. It is also devoid of the equivalent of a deposit guarantee scheme to protect its holders’ interests during a crisis, the executive detailed. He further pointed out that “the fact that Libra is backed by a basket of sovereign currency-denominated assets appears to defeat the very purpose of its issuance as a private currency.” Mersch then proceeded to outline some legal and regulatory challenges of Libra:

The first challenge concerns Libra’s fundamental legal nature. The choice is, essentially, whether to treat Libra as e-money, as a financial instrument or as a virtual currency.

In his view, Libra does not appear to qualify as e-money, as it does not embody a claim of its holders against the Libra Association. The second option is to treat it as a transferable security or a different type of financial instrument, which means that both the Libra Association and any entities providing investment services through Libra coins would fall within the remit of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Lastly, if it were to qualify as a virtual currency then both Calibra and its authorized resellers would become subject to the obligations and registration requirements under the Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

Another challenge is to ensure that the relevant EU and member state regulatory and supervisory authorities can assert jurisdiction over Libra and its network, Mersch conveyed, adding that there is also the need for cross-border cooperation and coordination. “Because Libra will be used across borders, it is a matter of international interest.” He elaborated:

Its global nature would also call for a global regulatory and supervisory response to avoid regulatory arbitrage, ensure consistency of outcomes and guarantee the efficiency of public policy responses to Libra.

Mersch pointed out the joint efforts by the global community to mitigate risks associated with Libra, including efforts by the G7 countries, the G20 countries, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). In its recently published report on how Libra could disrupt the financial system, the European Parliament wrote that “an international agreement is needed on harmonizing existing rules for crypto tokens.” The legislative body of the European Union believes that “Co-regulatory oversight of the Libra operation scheme by both state-operators and stakeholders would be needed to prevent money laundering, illicit transactions and consumer fraud.”

A Sept. 16 Economic Times report has taken the measure of industry sentiment on the ground, as a proposed blanket ban — currently still in the form of draft legislation — awaits its formal review process by lawmakers.

“The first large democracy” to ban crypto

As the Economic Times notes, the draft Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2019 has proposed a 10-year prison sentence for anyone who ""mines, generates, holds, sells, transfers, disposes of, issues or deals in cryptocurrencies.”

The severity of the proposed penalty and the extreme position reflected in the document — whether or not and in what form it eventually becomes national law — is already prompting local crypto businesses to take pre-emptive measures to protect themselves.

Rahul Jain — an employee at formerly domestic exchange Bitbns — told the Economic Times:

“As a startup from India, we always wanted to serve from India, but this recent complication has made it difficult for domestic crypto exchanges to operate their businesses in India. So, we are now an Estonia-based company, and any Indian law to criminalize crypto will not impact us.”

Nischal Shetty, CEO and founder of well-known Indian exchange WazirX has meanwhile argued that the proposed bill is poised to erode the wealth of over five million Indians who own “crypto assets worth thousands of crores.”

The executive said that the arbitrary decision to criminalize crypto-asset investment would destabilize existing businesses that have been operating legitimately and make the country an unfortunate pioneer in its role as “the first large democracy to ban an innovative technology such as crypto.”

Missing out on a $10 trillion industry

While local opinions differ as to whether or how the bill will evolve into a definitive statutory shape, the Economic Times’ sources were unanimous in viewing the summer’s developments as a retrograde move for the country. Shetty said:

“As a country largely reliant on the services sector, India will lose its edge as a technological power if the ban on crypto is enforced. Shunning this industry will mean massive job losses and a brain drain [...] Crypto is predicted to be a $10 trillion industry in the next five years, and if we are to achieve our Prime Minister’s goal being a $5 trillion economy, then crypto is integral to that vision.”

As reported this August, Sidharth Sogani — CEO of crypto and blockchain research firm Crebaco Global Inc —- has forecast that India will lose around $12.9 billion worth of market if cryptocurrency is eventually banned in the country.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-linux-malware-mines-crypto-while-remaining-undetectable,"Two threat analysts recently stumbled upon new Linux malware that keeps its cryptocurrency mining operations hidden.

On Sept. 16, Augusto Remillano II and Jakub Urbanec revealed in a post on Trend Micro, a security intelligence blog, that they found new Linux malware. According to the analysts, this malware is particularly notable because of the way it loads malicious kernel modules to hide its cryptocurrency mining operations.

Malware provides hackers full access to infected machine

The analysts revealed that Skidmap masks its cryptocurrency mining by utilizing a rootkit, which is a program that installs and executes code on a system without end user consent or knowledge. This makes its malware components undetectable by the infected system’s monitoring tools.

Besides running a cryptojacking campaign on the infected machine, the malware reportedly gives attackers “unfettered access” to the affected system. The analysts add:

“Skidmap also sets up a way to gain backdoor access to the machine, and also replaces the system’s pam_unix.so file with its own malicious version. This malicious file accepts a specific password for any users, thus allowing the attackers to log in as any user in the machine.”

Cryptojacking campaigns up by 29%

Cryptojacking is an industry term for stealth crypto mining attacks which work by installing malware or otherwise gaining access to a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge.

In August, cybersecurity company McAfee Labs released a threat report, in which it noted an increase in cryptojacking campaigns and ransomware attacks in Q1 2019. According to the report, cryptojacking has been on the rise, with a 29% increase in cryptojacking campaigns.",

The Shinjuku-based messaging provider, which is 73.36-percent owned by South Korea’s Naver, said in a statement on Tuesday that the new exchange, dubbed Bitmax, is now live with trading of five crypto assets: bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), ripple (XRP), bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC).

According to the statement, the service was introduced in stages from 3 p.m. Japan time on Tuesday and is available first on Android devices. It can be accessed via the wallet tab on the LINE mobile app and is also integrated with LINE Pay to provide an easier Japanese yen fiat on-ramp process.

LINE said in the announcement it currently has 81 million monthly active users in Japan and 164 million globally. It operates the crypto exchange through LVC Corporation, a subsidiary, which was awarded a cryptocurrency exchange license by Japan’s Financial Services Agency on Sept. 6.

BITMAX is available to residents of Japan with a LINE account. No fees are charged for trading, though a charge of 108 yen will be applied for deposits and withdrawals.

In terms of security, LINE said it utilizes a wallet developed by Palo Alto-based BitGo to segregate customer assets and store assets in a cold wallet, which is itself managed by a dedicated team.

A strict KYC process is in place for new customers. Applicants can register their account with the app using an ID card and photographic capture, with a registered bank account and an ID or by mail.

The new service will run separately from the company’s Singapore-based Bitbox, which has been in operation since July 2018 but excludes residents of Japan and the U.S.

Huobi Argentina plans to establish a local team and a fiat gateway to trade or convert the Argentine peso to cryptocurrency, the company said in a statement.

While users can currently purchase cryptocurrencies with the Argentine peso through Huobi’s over-the-counter service, Huobi Argentina will soon introduce a fiat gateway, estimated to launch around mid-October this year, said Huobi, which was founded in China but headquartered in Singapore.

With the Argentine peso gateway, users will be able to easily purchase cryptocurrencies via credit card, wire transfer, and through some of the most widely supported digital payment providers in the region such as Mercadopago.

Crisis-hit emerging market countries such as Argentina that are constantly dealing with persistent concerns about fiat currency devaluation are increasingly turning to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, market observers said. Bitcoin recently reached a new all-time high against the Argentine peso due to inflation.

“Argentina is South America’s most promising market for blockchain development,” said Carlos Banfi, chief executive officer at Huobi Argentina, in a statement.

“There already exists a general consensus to break from a reliance on the local currency and banks, and with Huobi’s entrance into the market, it is a great opportunity to move the needle on blockchain and crypto adoption in Argentina,” he added.

Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the digital currency bitcoin, is a shared database maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.

In March, Huobi founder and CEO Leon Li met with a delegation of senior Argentinian finance officials to discuss the role blockchain could play in Argentina’s economic development, the company said.

“The increasing demand for crypto-related products and services makes Argentina a perfect entry point for Huobi to pursue larger projects in promoting cryptocurrency and blockchain to the market,” said David Chen, senior business director at Huobi Cloud.

The English-language Luxembourg Times reported on Sept. 17 that Deloitte is testing Bitcoin among its employees to “see how the audit giant could use the cryptocurrency.”

Laurent Collet, a partner at Deloitte's advisory arm, said:

“We think it's good to have our employees assess this new technology.”

Only an internal test

Collet stressed there are no plans to allow clients to pay in Bitcoin in the near future. PwC Luxembourg, another Big Four firm, will start accepting Bitcoin payments from Oct. 1.

Blockchain not Bitcoin

Collet explained that Deloitte’s priority is to use blockchain in its fund management activities to process transactions, rather than make payments in Bitcoin. This is because it would speed up the process of moving funds, make audits easier, and remove middlemen. He concluded:

“This is where we focus our attention right now in linking this new technology with the needs of the Luxembourg industry.”

As Cointelegraph reported on Sept. 16, an economist from the Bank for International Settlements has also proposed new ways of supervising financial risks through distributed ledger technology.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-not-accepted-burger-kings-crypto-foray-short-lived,"The German branch of Burger King has begun accepting Bitcoin (BTC) on its website and mobile app, as reported by Cointelegraph on Sept. 3. But has the initiative increased consumer demand for the company’s fast food, and is it really possible to buy the popular Whopper burger with Bitcoin? What difficulties has the restaurant faced in its three years of cryptocurrency experience?

Whoppers for Bitcoins

Burger King was one of the first international fast-food chains to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment. For the first time, visitors were reportedly able to buy burgers with crypto back in 2016 when the Netherlands branch of Burger King started accepting Bitcoin, with the first restaurant offering burgers to crypto holders located in Bitcoin-friendly Arnhem. The announcement was made by the first Bitcoin embassy on Feb. 18, 2016.

The Burger King Arnhem branch also announced that any customer who pays in Bitcoin will get a second Whopper for free and that the restaurant will host special meetups for those interested in digital currencies.

However, on May 31, the Arnhem Bitcoinstad representatives announced that local Burger King restaurants have stopped accepting Bitcoin and the digital currency payment initiative was just a temporary promotional campaign:

“Unfortunately, Burger King no longer accepts bitcoins after 31 May. So you only have a chance this month to take advantage of their offer! If you pay Whopper with bitcoins, you will receive a second Whopper for free!”

You can’t use or trade WhopperCoin

Since that time, crypto burgers have reached Russia. Burger King Russia announced a new payment method and even released a WhopperCoin loyalty bonus. But has anyone heard anything about Bitcoin and Burger King since then? Hardly.

On Aug. 25, 2017, 1 billion WhopperCoins (WHO) were issued using the Waves blockchain. The new cryptocurrency was intended for buying Whoppers or other burgers and sides. In particular, the company promised a free flagship Whopper to any customer who accumulates 1,700 coins.

At the same time, Burger King Russia actively promoted its cryptocurrency, and the translated statement claims that “eating Whoppers today makes for a financially prosperous tomorrow.” One can find out whether WHO holders have gained financial success by looking at the trading charts on the YoBit exchange. To date, YoBit is the only exchange on which WHO is listed, although WHO-BTC trading volumes stand at zero.

It’s not so easy to find a Russian Burger King restaurant where Bitcoin payments are accepted, nor is it possible to make an online order using crypto. This may be caused by the active interference of Russian authorities in the local franchise’s activities. Specifically, the Moscow prosecutor’s office repeatedly summoned representatives of Burger King Russia to explain the operation of WhopperCoins and confirm that the company hadn’t issued its tokens for general use, reminding them about the illegal nature of cryptocurrency operations in Russia.

“Wir akzeptieren Bitcoin”

After two years of silence, the Burger King-Bitcoin tandem reappeared in the media, with the German division’s announcement that it will now accept Bitcoin payments on its delivery site and mobile app. The news and subsequent user discussion quickly spread across the internet:

“BREAKING: Burger King in Germany now accepts Bitcoin in their app!\ “Every day more than 11 million guests visit Burger King restaurants around the world. It’s the second largest fast food burger place in the world. “BTC accepted here, BTC accepted there, BTC accepted everywhere!”

To increase the volume of its retail sales, Burger King has created a mobile application. It was reported that San Diego’s Tillster, which seeks to adapt to the ever-growing customer base of a restaurant chain and the requirements for a well-scalable payment system, has become a partner in its creation. Perse Faily, CEO of Tillster, said:

“For consumers, they are able to utilize a convenient easy way to pay for their goods and opt-in to additional services that brands are developing, [...] such as loyalty programs, exclusive coupons and other engagement tools.”

Notably, Burger King chose to remain silent about the new payment method, while a more detailed study showed that its restaurants have nothing to do with Bitcoin, although its partner does.

So, can a burger be bought for BTC at a Burger King in Germany? Yes, but not in its brick-and-mortar restaurants. One can pay with Bitcoins and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) by ordering delivery online through the Lieferservice delivery service, which works with restaurants throughout the country. In other words, it’s akin to Apple announcing that AirPods have become available for purchasing online, but were actually sold on Amazon. As it appears, this is not Burger King’s own initiative.

At the same time, Burger King Lieferservice redirects users to BitPay upon ordering products, which, in turn, generates a QR code for payment in Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.

Where can I really pay with Bitcoin?

Judging by interactive Coinmap statistics, the number of offline venues accepting Bitcoin today exceeds 15,400. From time to time, information appears on the internet that visitors of one establishment or another can pay with cryptocurrency. In May, United States-based payment service Flexa enabled Starbucks and 14 other retailers to handle Bitcoin transactions. In July, Singapore’s food chain KOPItech installed special stall-specific kiosks for customers to order food using cryptocurrencies. But does any of this really work?

With Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) or Dash, one can buy burgers, street food, coffee, pizza, or sushi in the U.S., Australia, the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia and even Kenya. In the Estonian capital of Tallinn, the convenience of cryptocurrencies was much appreciated by coffee houses — clientele can pay with crypto at 10 venues. A cryptocurrency wallet can be used to buy pastries at Dublin’s Krust Bakery and sweets at Rom’s Steccolecco. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency payments are accepted at 94 restaurants to date in the U.S., according to BitcoinRestaurants.net.

In most cases, small, private venues or local franchises of large chains are the ones taking the initiative. As for the latter, the idea of ​​using cryptocurrencies as payment has usually come from a local restaurant owner and is an advertisement in nature. A popular example is when the Canadian branch of another fast-food giant, KFC, announced a temporary promotional campaign on Jan. 11, 2018 that included BTC payments. The restaurant owners decided to support the popularity of cryptocurrencies by adding “Bitcoin Basket” to the menu — i.e., a bucket of chicken wings.

Related: Blockchain for Food, How the Industry Makes Use of the Technology

A competitor of KFC, Subway, has also been reportedly attempting to set up Bitcoin payments to attract customers. Emily Rossi from Ruder Finn, a PR agency claiming to work with Burger King, noted that, as a rule, such promotions are temporary:

“It seems that the one restaurant that was accepting bitcoin may no longer be accepting it. Again, though, it varies by restaurant since each is independently owned and operated, so it’s up to each franchisee, not headquarters.”

How to pay with Bitcoins?

In most cases, restaurants and cafes use a QR code to receive cryptocurrencies, and the role of processing is assigned to operators such as BitPay and Coincheck. Meanwhile, developing countries often resort to local mobile applications that are developed to order.

By scanning the QR code, customers are able to transfer money from their cryptocurrency wallets to the ones belonging to venues. Transaction records are permanently stored on the blockchain, while account information remains private.

Atila Ajdinovski, the owner of a Bitcoin-friendly restaurant in North Jersey, claimed that using cryptocurrency as a form of payment could be more secure than paying with a credit card:

""When they have your credit card, they have the expiration date. They have all the codes. They can turn around and rob your credit card without you knowing.""

Problems

Despite prohibitive cryptocurrency laws, many venues are forced to come up with backdoors. One of these is converting client funds into fiat money, while conducting internal accounting in the traditional currency. Many restaurants try to circumvent the law by calling their cryptocurrency “loyalty bonuses,” like Russia’s Burger King and Lavka-Lavka, a farm-to-table restaurant chain. The owners of both establishments have repeatedly attracted the attention of authorities and even dealt with lawsuits.

Another problem faced by cafes wishing to accept cryptocurrency is the lack of widespread use of digital money. This question is especially relevant in developing countries. The venues have found a solution by installing crypto machines that exchange fiat for BTC, allowing everyone who wants to try something new but lacks cryptocurrencies to use the machine. Such an initiative was introduced in Prague, a unique project of a cafe and coworking center where payment is made exclusively with digital currency.

That being said, when a restaurant doesn’t pay for the transaction fee, the client may encounter paying a rather high one in some cases. A customer of a Ukrainian restaurant paid around 21% for processing the payment, sharing his negative experience on the internet:

Good for promotion, but premature for large-scale use

Most often, Bitcoin is accepted by small local cafes or family restaurants. Many representatives of large chains are testing this feature in individual venues, but are not introducing it at a large scale. Some news regarding BTC acceptance can simply be attributed to PR campaign and a desire to make the headlines of the media amid the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies.

In many respects, the reasons for the slow development of cryptocurrencies in the food and beverage industry are related to regulatory issues and ambiguity around the legal status of digital money, as well as consumer distrust in a new form of payment.

Meanwhile, the prevalence of progressive Bitcoin-friendly cities like Arnhem, where locals pay with cryptocurrency as often as with bank cards, are indicative of a future cashless society.",,https://www.coindesk.com/will-bitcoins-price-rally-after-federal-reserve-rate-cut,"View

Bitcoin has dived out of a narrowing price range and may see a deeper drop if key trendline support near $10,120 is breached.

Acceptance below $10,120 would expose the recent low of $9,855.

Some notable observers believe the decline may be reversed following Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rate cut, although historical data suggests otherwise.

On the higher side, $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) remains the level to beat for the bulls.

Bitcoin is down again, but some observers believe the losses could be reversed after a U.S. interest rate cut expected Wednesday.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to lows below $10,100 yesterday, marking a downside break of the narrowing price range created near $10,300 in the three days to Sept. 15.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,150 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.4 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

So, the bears have gained an upper hand in the last 24 hours despite record high miner confidence, and a deeper drop may unfold in the next 24 hours.

The decline, however, could end up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market, according to some observers, who expect BTC to benefit from an impending 25 basis point U.S. rate cut on Wednesday.

For instance, Nigel Green, founder and CEO of a global financial advisory giant deVere Group, believes the cryptocurrency will pick up a strong bid in response to the Federal Reserve’s rate cut, as the reduction in borrowing costs will lower the yield (return) on the U.S. dollar.

Meanwhile, Anthony Pompliano, founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, tweeted in August that BTC could fly high if the Fed rate cuts are followed by a government buying program (quantitative easing).

Former Wall Street Journal trader and journalist Max Keiser also believes the Fed’s continued monetary easing would send bitcoin to $100,000.

Rate cuts are inflationary in nature, meaning they reduce the purchasing power of fiat currencies.

Hence, there is a general consensus in the crypto market that Federal Reserve’s monetary easing will bode well for bitcoin, which is deflationary in nature and is set to undergo a mining reward halving (supply cut) in less than a year.

Bitcoin, however, has seldom taken cues from the Fed’s actions in the past. For instance, the Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points in December 2015. That was the first hike since 2006. The central bank delivered another rate hike in December 2016 and hiked rates four times in 2017.

Even so, BTC broke into a bull market with a convincing move above $300 at the end of October 2015 and went on to hit a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.

As such, the probability of BTC responding positively to tomorrow’s rate cut is debatable.

Also, traditional markets have priced in a 25 basis point rate cut and the FX markets will likely dump the U.S. dollar only if the Fed cuts rates by 50 basis points or signals aggressive easing over the near term. In that case, the anti-dollar sentiment may feed into the crypto markets.

Daily and 4-hour charts

Bitcoin fell to $10,060 on Monday, signaling a downside break of the narrowing price range of the back-to-back inside bar candlesticks, as discussed yesterday.

As of now, prices are sitting on the ascending trendline support at $10,120. A break lower would further strengthen the bear grip and allow a deeper drop to $9,855.

On the higher side, the bearish lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20 remains the level to beat for the bulls.

That level could come into play if the rising trendline support fuels a price bounce above $10,458 (Friday’s high).

The probability of a downside break is high as last week’s falling wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart (above right) failed to draw bids. In fact, the breakout ended up creating another bearish lower high at $10,458.

The survey, reported by FXStreet on Sept. 17, revealed that among those born between 1981 and 1996 with investable assets of £25,000 ($31,000) or more, 20% had invested in the new asset class.

Almost 7 times the national average

As FXStreet notes, this 20% figure is markedly higher than the national average of 3% — indicating that well-off millennials in the U.K. are almost 7 times more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies than the general public.

Moreover, when it comes to millennials with over £75,000 ($93,000) worth of investable assets, the percentage of cryptocurrency investors jumps to 29%.

Notably, 70% of respondents indicated that their investable wealth derived from salary and wages, while 40% said it was through investment returns.

This interest in investment opportunities translates into a high level of fluency with online trading infrastructure: 35% of respondents said they invest using electronic trading platforms, while 27% said they consulted social trading platforms and browsed or participated in trader e-communities.

Generational divides

Michelmores’ survey bolsters research conducted earlier this year on the other side of the pond. The results of a United States-wide Bankrate survey this July indicated that cryptocurrencies are three times more popular among American millennials as a top-choice, long-term investment option than for Generation X.

Also in July, 26% of Generation Z in the U.S. — generally defined as those born after 1997 — said they would be somewhat, very or extremely likely to buy cryptocurrency in the next 6 months.

In April, an industry survey revealed that 11% of the American population owns Bitcoin, identifying Bitcoin ownership is a “demographic mega-trend” led by the younger generation in the 18-34 year age range. Nonetheless, 89% of U.S. citizens had heard of the cryptocurrency, regardless of their generation.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/18000-traders-and-growing-bitcoin-coms-crypto-exchange-shines-brightly/,"18,000 Traders and Growing - Bitcoin.com's Crypto Exchange Shines Brightly

According to the ACC, the cryptocurrency analytics solution is being sought for use by the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC) for use in criminal investigations and other missions.

The notice outlines that the contractor must provide a cloud-based, online service — not reliant on hardware or software — that can assist law enforcement in identifying and pursuing actors using cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes such as fraud, extortion and money laundering.

The contractor should provide the source of the cryptocurrency transactions, with the capacity to offer multi-cryptocurrency analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) to other major cryptocurrencies.

Other requirements include providing “real-time Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transaction tracing,” including service attribution and identification, as well as being able to identify transaction patterns and interactions with other entities.

Another day, another Bitcoin pump delay

Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD had entered yet another day of flat performance, slowly eroding support above $10,000.

Such sideways trading has characterized Bitcoin for almost a week since a push to local highs above $10,400 ran out of momentum.

At press time, BTC/USD circled $10,190, putting in zero progress since Tuesday as the altcoin market conversely surged.

Despite the uninspiring market landscape, analysts believe Bitcoin is ripe for a return to form of its own.

As Cointelegraph reported, sentiment is building around a fresh bullish uptrend, something which has failed to materialize so far this week.

“Soon we’re going to get the move,” regular Cointelegraph contributor Filb Filb told followers of his Telegram trading channel in a fresh update on Wednesday.

For Filb Filb, the current altcoin bounce could yet preclude a Bitcoin resurgence. Nonetheless, the apparent buoyant state of the market could also echo the start of 2018, which marked altcoin highs but preceded a year-long crypto bear market.

“Had many discussions with people about how alts could be a leading indicator. It is true that historically they do tend to show fingerprint for a bigger move, however, dont ever forget them pumping the alts at top of 2018,” he added.

Traders show little faith in altcoin prospects

Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, polled the cryptocurrency Twitter community over the outlook for alt markets.

Out of roughly 700 respondents, opinions were split as to whether the future had further gains in store.

Daily altcoin returns hit 20%

There was cause for celebration across altcoin tokens on Wednesday. Far from modest gains, some coins in the top 20 by market cap appreciated as much as 20%.

Leading the charge was Stellar (XLM), which hit $0.07 for the first time since late August. Other strong performers were XRP, Tron (TRX) and Tezos (XTZ).

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, gained 8% on the day, taking it to $214 and its best rate since early last month.

While tax laws on cryptocurrency vary by jurisdiction, there are many useful tools to help you calculate crypto taxes, lower your tax liabilities, and simplify your filing — no matter where you are. Many of them work globally, supporting tax forms of multiple countries, and can import data directly from all major crypto exchanges.

Crypto Tax Tools

Tax laws and filing obligations may vary from country-to-country, state-to-state, and even city-to-city, but there are many tools that work worldwide to help you. In preparing to file your taxes, you would first need to have good records of all your crypto dealings to determine the types of taxes you owe and how much. The tax tools below can help you keep records of your crypto transactions, calculate your tax liabilities, minimize taxes owed, and prepare your filing. They are especially useful for those frequently trading many cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges.

Beartax is a cryptocurrency tax service with audit support. You can consolidate trades across over 40 exchanges and calculate capital gains. The platform is tailored to individuals, CPAs, and enterprise-level accounting firms.

Bittax is a tax filing platform which offers up to 3 calculation methods to optimize your tax results. You can import your wallet addresses and exchange data to calculate your taxes.

Blox offers cryptocurrency accounting, tracking and management tools, aimed at clients such as crypto businesses, asset managers, mining operations, crypto funds, and VCs. It also offers specific tools for mining operations.

Cointracker is a cryptocurrency wallet tracker and tax calculator that provides full tax reports for four countries and capital gain reports for all countries.

Cointracking analyzes your trades and generates real-time reports on profit and loss, realized and unrealized gains, and others for tax preparation. Data can be directly imported from eight wallets, over 50 crypto exchanges, as well as 15 closed platforms such as Mt. Gox.

Cryptotax can import data from over 20 exchanges. It offers country-specific tax reports which can be generated in over 30 local currencies.

Cryptotrader supports 26 cryptocurrency exchanges. It has partnered with Turbotax, a leading U.S. tax preparation platform, so your data can be directly imported into Turbotax software for e-filing.

Koinly helps you calculate cryptocurrency taxes and minimize taxable gains in over 100 countries. Data can be directly imported from 33 exchanges, five wallets, and six blockchains.

Tokentax accepts data from every major cryptocurrency exchange and helps you calculate your crypto taxes and file your full return.

Zenledger also works with all major exchanges, cryptocurrencies, and fiat currencies. It is an official Turbotax partner so your data can be automatically imported into the popular tax preparation software.

Some of the tools above are also discussed in our articles on portfolio tracking tools and tax calculation tools.

Taxable Transactions and Filing

Once you have all of your crypto records on hand, you can either take them to a tax accountant who can help you file your taxes or use a tax preparation software to do it yourself. For U.S. filers, there are many software products, including the aforementioned Turbotax, to help you file your taxes and claim applicable deductions and credits. Digital asset exchange platform Coinbase described in a nutshell:

All crypto sells, conversions, payments, donations, and earned income are reportable by U.S. taxpayers.

Not all crypto transactions are taxable, however. Some examples of non-taxable events include donating cryptocurrencies to a qualified tax-exempt charity, buying crypto with cash and holding it, and transferring cryptocurrencies between wallets.

A tax preparation software usually takes care of evaluating which transactions are taxable. It usually asks questions about your crypto earnings and transactions, then inputs your answers into relevant tax forms. However, these questions can be vague and some software may not provide enough explanation for you to accurately answer them, potentially resulting in errors on tax forms. In addition, even if your tax filing was accepted, tax authorities could ask you to file amended returns or pay back taxes years later, as did the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in its recent letters to crypto owners.

Most software aims to help you lower your tax liabilities, such as through capital loss deductions, as crypto losses can be used to offset other types of capital gains or income.

A survey by personal finance firm Credit Karma shows that the number of taxpayers who reported short-term capital losses from cryptocurrencies in the first month of this year jumped 521% year-on-year. However, the company additionally found that the number of people who would not declare their crypto income also increased.

Refunds and Payments in Crypto

If you are due a tax refund, you may be able to receive it in cryptocurrency. Refundo, a provider of tax-related financial products, has been helping U.S. taxpayers receive all or a portion of their federal and state tax refunds in BTC. The platform works with a number of leading tax software such as Turbotax, Taxact, Credit Karma, and H&R Block. Refunds are sent directly to the taxpayer’s wallet. In April, the company partnered with payments provider Bitpay to enable refunds to be sent through Bitpay’s payouts.

A growing number of cities and states worldwide are starting to accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments. The Swiss cities of Zug and Chiasso and the U.S. state of Ohio, for example, are already doing so. Ohio accepts both bitcoin and bitcoin cash for payments of 23 types of taxes through Bitpay. The state of New Hampshire has approved a bill to allow tax payments in bitcoin, and the Canadian city of Richmond Hill, Ontario, has announced that its residents will soon have the option to pay their property taxes in the digital currency.

The new system uses GK8’s proprietary cryptographic techniques that enable instant blockchain transactions of digital assets without any need for an internet connection, Israeli business news publication Globes reported on Sept. 18.

The company raised $4 million in a funding round led by Discount Capital, a venture arm of one of Israel’s three largest banks, Discount Bank, and Marius Nacht, a co-founder of cybersecurity giant Checkpoint. Other investors reportedly included EdenBlock, iAngels, IDEAL-HLS, StratX and the Israel Innovation Authority.

As reported by Globes, GK8’s new cryptographic techniques allowed the company to develop a cold wallet with “hot wallet functionalities,” securing user funds from hackers and cyberattacks.

Unidirectional connection

In a recent interview with Fortune, GK8 CEO Lior Lamesh described GK8's technology as ""ledger agnostic,"" hinting that it can be used for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. According to Lamesh, G8K is capable of recording transactions on a blockchain in offline mode thanks to ""unidirectional connection.""

GK8’s technology is up and running, and is already being used by digital asset trading platform eToro.

Fortune reports that GK8 was founded in 2018 by two members of an Israeli special defense unit that specializes in guarding the country’s digital assets.

According to Silicon Valley-based crypto intelligence firm CipherTrace, cryptocurrency thefts reached $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2019 — $500,000 less than what was stolen throughout the whole of 2018.",,https://www.coindesk.com/people-with-least-knowledge-most-positive-on-cryptos-future-ing-survey,"People with less knowledge about cryptocurrency are the most likely to be positive on its future, according to new research from Dutch bank ING.

In a survey published Wednesday – which polled around 1,000 people in each of 15 mostly European countries – ING found that, overall, the level of detailed knowledge about crypto is fairly low.

While 74 percent answered correctly that cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money, roughly the same amount (73 percent) said cryptos are run by a centralized body, or didn’t know. A small majority were, however, correct when answering questions on volatility and in-store acceptance.

Examining how attitudes vary among the pools of people with varying knowledge of the subject, ING found that the least knowledgeable were the most positive.

The report states:

“Of the 13% in Europe who could correctly identify one of the five statements as either true or false, and therefore were labelled as having low knowledge, most either had a high (43%) or medium (37%) attitude towards the future of cryptocurrencies. This was almost identical for those who could correctly identify two or three out of the five statements, demonstrating medium knowledge.”

Respondents with greater knowledge showed more negative sentiment in the survey, with just 32 percent being positive about the future use of cryptos.

“People are wary of cryptocurrencies – a reflection, most probably, of their being new and relatively intricate. The workings of blockchain, the idea of mining for something intangible and storing it in a digital wallet is, after all, novel and unfamiliar for many,” ING said in the report.

Of those that knew at least a little about the subject, Turkey was the only nation with a majority of respondents displaying positive attitudes (62 percent). Aside from Romania (44 percent) and Poland (43 percent), most nations had levels of around 30 percent or lower.

People were roughly equally split in the survey when asked to respond to statements on crypto’s role as the future of online spending and investment. Thirty-two percent said it is the future of online spending, down from 35 percent in 2018.

Thirty-five percent expected the value of cryptocurrencies to rise in the next 12 months.

After the “crypto winter,” a year of price drops and doldrums, crypto spring sent BTC rising back up; crypto summer has sustained the price over $10,000.

Now that we’re entering into autumn, a rather unique set of circumstances has the market poised to move in either direction. Perhaps most notably is the fact that for the last several weeks, BTC dominance–the ratio of capital in Bitcoin markets to the amount of capital in altcoin markets–has been hovering around 70 percent, the highest that it has been since July of 2017.

London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech – Join Now

Marc Bhargava, Co-founder and President of digital asset trading platform Tagomi, told Finance Magnates that that figure could be even higher.

“[The] key insight here is that dominance is actually higher than reported since more of the alt market caps are not liquid. BTC dominance could be closer to 80%,” he said. “On CoinMarket Cap, it says bitcoin dominance is 68%, but includes a lot of questionable exchange volume plus many tokens outside the top 15 which really aren’t tradeable in meaningful size. Therefore, the market caps are not correct.”

The rise began to pick up speed in late April, several weeks after the first in a series of strong upward price movements in BTC. On April 1st, the price of BTC was roughly $4,132; by the end of the month, it had surpassed $5,200. At press time, BTC was trading for $10,270, up a fraction of a percent over the last 24 hours.

What’s driving Bitcoin dominance up? And where do we go from here?

Bakkt launch could be driving both BTC price and BTC dominance

Several events over the course of the last two months have been speculated as being the driving force behind the latest upward movements in BTC dominance.

The most “popular” theories seem to be connected to two announcements of institutional products: first, the announcement that the Intercontinental Exchange-backed cryptocurrency futures trading platform, Bakkt, will finally launch after a year of delays; second, the launch of VanEck/SolidX’ so-called “limited ETF”, and the upcoming October SEC decision on the full ETF.

A number of analysts have predicted that the launch of Bakkt will bring a wave of institutional capital into cryptocurrency markets (particularly Bitcoin’s); as such, it’s possible that a number of holders have been stocking up on BTC in anticipation of a possible price run.

Alternatively, institutional traders may even already be depositing BTC into Bakkt trading accounts in preparation for the launch.

In fact, a massive transaction earlier this month involving the sending of 94,505 BTC (worth roughly $1 billion) to a Bitcoin wallet earlier this month was widely speculated to be a such a deposit.

Could ETF drama be a factor?

The launch of the so-called “limited ETF” by Van Eck and SolidX did not bring in nearly as much capital or interest from investors as was originally anticipated. As of September 12th, roughly $41,000–the equivalent of just around 4 BTC–had been invested in the product.

Still, the launch of the limited ETF has brought more media attention onto the fact that the SEC must make a final decision on Van Eck/SolidX’ application for a Bitcoin ETF this coming October, after months and months of delays.

However, in a LinkedIn post, Michael Creadon, Head of Institutional Sales at DrawBridge Lending, warned about the possible negative consequences of this limited ETF: “I get nervous when I see stories about backdoor, ‘technical’ SEC rulings,” he said, referencing the fact that the limited ETF was created on the basis of SEC exemption 144A.

“All the SEC rules are technical. Do you mean to tell me we’ve been awaiting BTC ETFs for 5 years & only now some attorney cracked the code & read the entire rule book? I’ll give an example: our firm can’t face retail investors because we use swaps. That’s the rule–period.”

Creadon also pointed out that the media cycle–and the price movements that have followed–surrounding the Van Eck/SolidX Bitcoin ETF has all become a bit too speculative: “coming from Chicago where futures and options rule supreme I think the BTC ETF melodrama is a bit overblown,” he wrote. “but hey, all new derivatives are a positive and I respect the heck out of the Van Eck team’s perseverance. And I hope that this approval’ is fully in lockstep with the regulators in Washington so we don’t have to take another mulligan.”

When compared with BTC, altcoins are way down

Whatever the cause, crypto market analyst Willy Woo pointed out that the effect of the rise in Bitcoin dominance has been–well, not great.

This becomes particularly clear if altcoin prices are measured in BTC rather than USD. Woo showed this in a rather aesthetically pleasing chart on Twitter:

“Shit runs downhill”, 2019 bull season edition. This is the performance of the the top 200 coins measured in satoshi value (performance against BTC). Note alts got particularly rekted after BTC broke out on 1st Apr. pic.twitter.com/lN3Jdnsfni — Willy Woo (@woonomic) August 13, 2019

Ark Invest crypto analyst Yassine Elmandjra made a similar point in a separate series of tweets.

2/ In BTC terms: – ETH is down 77%

– XRP is down 67%

– BCH is down 50%

– LTC is down 90%

– BNB is down 25%

– EOS is down 60%

– BSV is down 26%

– XMR is down 60% from when their current USD price levels were at highs in BTC terms. — Yassine Elmandjra (@yassineARK) August 12, 2019

Are we in store for an “alt-season”?

But perhaps Bitcoin’s dominance could eventually benefit altcoins in a meaningful way–after all, the “alt-season” phenomena that showed a repeated pattern of increased capital in altcoin markets following boosts in Bitcoin could point to an eventual recovery.

As such, some analysts have claimed that Bitcoin dominance will soon take a heavy hit. According to “Bitcoin Jack,” former lead analyst at Bitcoin Bravado, now is a crucial time to hodl onto one’s altcoins, and that BTC dominance will soon “fall off a cliff.”

Where is this all headed?

So, if altcoin markets continue to stay strong–or even grow in strength–how will BTC’s dominance and price be affected long term?

Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, noted in a tweet that “Bitcoin dominance is now comparable to where it was before there was even a developed market for altcoins.”

“Hard to see it getting much stronger than here,” he added, suggesting that this is the limit for BTC given the number of altcoins currently on the market.

Bitcoin dominance is now comparable to where it was before there was even a developed market for altcoins. Hard to see it getting much stronger from here. pic.twitter.com/pgfNWLQipr — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) September 16, 2019

Indeed, Bitcoin dominance hasn’t been this high for more than two years, and the number of altcoins has grown significantly during the same period. However, altcoins have been a significant force in BTC markets for far longer than that.

“There was a thriving market for them, on an understandably less grandiose scale, during the bull market of 2013,” wrote crypto journalist Richard Delaney in a piece for NewsBTC earlier this week. “The names might have been largely different and the sums of money smaller, but for those in the industry at that time, the hype was comparable.”

Willy Woo drops the mic: market corrections are yet to come

However, Willy Woo pointed out in a series of tweets that altcoin markets still haven’t completely “detoxed” from the hype cycles that took place at the end of 2017.

If this level fails, I’d expect roughly a 60% drop relative to Bitcoin’s cap before we some the next area of support. pic.twitter.com/FpOIIjVeqD — Willy Woo (@woonomic) September 8, 2019

“Fundamentally, though alts are screaming in pain, these two charts show how they have not yet detoxed from 2017 bubble valuations,” he wrote. “Though locally oversold and may see some bounce in coming weeks, longer term, into 2020, I can’t see these levels holding (relative to Bitcoin).”

Here’s the same data visualised on the price domain.

In any case, the market is poised for a powerful move–only time will tell what happens next.",2019-09-18 09:52:32+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/new-bitcoin-mutual-fund-eases-crypto-investing-for-eager-yet-wary-asian-investors,"Hong Kong-based venture capital group CMCC Global launched its Liberty Bitcoin Fund to provide crypto currency access to accredited investors in Asia who are very interested but have been slow to buy the coins directly.

The Liberty Bitcoin Fund is a single-asset passive tracker of Bitcoin and offers services including buying and safekeeping coins.

“We have received more and more questions over the years from our existing investor base about whether we could help them buy Bitcoin,” Martin Baumann, managing partner of CMCC Global, told CoinDesk. “The new fund is really a demand-driven.”

CMCC Global has set up three funds since 2016. All of the funds are focused on investments in proprietary technical infrastructure such as ethereum network where developers can build applications.

The funds have raised more funding from high net worth individuals, family offices assets and institutional investors over time. The first fund in the CMCC Liquid VC series gathered $1 million while the other two successors received $3.5 million and $30 million.

Baumann said the anchor investor for the third fund is one of the largest family offices in Asia, while declining to reveal the identity of the investor due to privacy and regulatory requirements.

Japanese messaging app Line also invested in the third fund, Baumann added.

The latest fund uses ANXONE Custody, a proprietary digital asset safekeeping system with insured wallets provided by custodian BC Group, a digital asset technology company publicly listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

Growing Demand for Digital Asset Class

There is rising demand for cryptocurrencies as an asset class for traditional funds, industry pros said.

“As digital assets mature and gain recognition, such as being included in mutual funds and ETFs, this volatility should slowly subside, making it a more appropriate investment in multi-asset portfolios,” Kostya Etus, portfolio manager at CLS Investments, a money management firm, told CoinDesk.

As digital assets grow to be perceived as a legitimate investment in portfolios, mutual funds have become one of the most accessible ways to own crypto.

“Investors who prefer not to open accounts specifically for digital assets would be able to purchase mutual funds within their standard brokerage accounts and maintain all of their assets in one place.” Etus said.

While cryptocurrencies might not be as stable as traditional asset classes including fixed income and equity, Etus pointed out their price movements tend to be non-correlated with other asset classes, increasing the diversification benefit of adding crypto to already diversified portfolios.

Despite the benefits, volatility in digital assets such as Bitcoin is very high, sometimes moving more in one day than some asset classes do in years, Etus said. “This extreme volatility may be dangerous and detrimental to portfolio returns.”

In addition, the Asia Pacific region remains one of the most deep pocketed area, with investors eager to invest across asset classes.

According to a PwC report in January, assets under management in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to grow from $15.1 trillion in 2017 to $16.9 trillion in 2020, and then nearly double to $29.6 trillion by 2025, a total compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7%.

Limited Access in Asia

Crypto investment in Asia is less common than you’d think.

“If you are a billionaire in Hong Kong or anywhere in the world, you don’t get a ledger and tell your analyst to buy some Bitcoin for you, and then he runs away with it. That’s just doesn’t work,” Baumann said.

CMCC is launching its Liberty Bitcoin Fund with the ambition to provide digital asset management services in Asia to be on par with Grayscale in the U.S., Baumann said.

“Investors needed a regulated outfit in which they could invest, something like Grayscale in New York,” Baumann said. “What we’re doing here is a similar story.”

When the company started to invest in digital assets in 2016, it had a hard time to find basic services such as auditing and fund administration, which would have been easy for an equity or a fixed income fund.

“These things did not exist. If you approached a fund administrator, they would not work with you because they wouldn’t work with digital asset companies or crypto companies,” Baumann said. “Or if you approached the bank, you’re having a hard time getting a bank card.”

“You need auditors, you need a licensed fund administrator, you need to have professional care.” he said. “We need an anti-money laundering people, and amongst others you need to have a professional custodian.”

Raw made her remarks yesterday at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women International Summit, where she stated:

“The very tangible nature of gold is what keeps a special place for it. So it will always have value, whatever the price is, I don’t know, but it will not be zero. Whereas cryptocurrency could be zero — that’s the difference.”

The report points out that — so long as gold is being used for jewelry and electronics — it is guaranteed to have some value. That said, Raw also admits that “the phenomenon of cryptocurrency is here to stay.”

Hopes to bring young investors back to gold

Raw hopes that the gold industry will be able to win back young investors between the ages of 20 and 40 that ended up preferring crypto assets to gold. Raw admitted that currently, parties buying gold are mostly the Indian and Chinese markets, institutions and central banks.

She added that among young investors, there is an impression that the only people buying gold are “old fogies who are buying it because they’re scared of the world.” She said:

“What I would like is actually to see gold harness that. [...] I think the gold industry has got its head in the sand by not taking advantage of a changing demographic. [...] My ambition over time is actually to see how as a gold industry we can harness that younger demographic.”

The primary reason for this sudden resurgence is the general revival of the cryptocurrency market, which saw trading prices recover after a spectacular crash in late 2018.

Monero, the cryptocurrency of choice of most crypto-mining malware operations, was one of the many cryptocurrencies that were impacted by this market slump. The currency also referred to as XMR, has gone down from an exchange rate that orbited around $300 - $400 in late 2017 to a meager $40 - $50 at the end of 2018.

But as the Monero trading price recovered throughout 2018, tripling its value from $38 at the start of the year, to nearly $115 over the summer, so have malware campaigns.

This recovery in XMR trading price has resulted in a spike in the activity of Monero-based crypto-mining malware operations.

These are criminal operations during which hackers infect systems with malware that's specifically designed to secretly mine Monero behind the computer owner's back.

Starting with the end of May, the number of reports detailing crypto-mining campaigns published by cyber-security firms has exploded, with a new report published each week, and sometimes new campaigns being uncovered on a daily basis.

History of crypto-mining malware

Crypto-mining malware first became a threat in the early 2000s, when Bitcoin started to become popular. In the beginning, malware operators deployed Bitcoin-based crypto-miners, but as Bitcoin became harder to mine on regular computers, they started shifting towards many of the other altcoins.

Due to its anonymity-centric features, Monero slowly became a favorite among cybercriminal gangs. However, crypto-mining malware never became a huge thing until late 2017 and early 2018, when cryptocurrency prices skyrocketed to record levels, and when Monero reached its maximum trading value of $480.

Trading a nearly $500, Monero became just too hard to ignore by that point, and several criminal groups decided they wanted a piece. The sudden spike in Monero-based crypto-miners didn't go unnoticed at the time.

In a feature for Bleeping Computer, a news site focused on cyber-security topics, this reporter highlighted a massive jump in Monero-based malware operations towards the end of 2017, and early 2018, just as Monero prices were bloating up.

At the time, everywhere you'd look, you'd find malware gangs trying to deploy Monero-mining malware. What was once an outlier in the malware scene had suddenly become the most common form of malware.

Malware groups/campaigns like Digmine, Hexmen, Loapi, Zealot, WaterMiner, CodeFork, Bondnet, Adylkuzz, CoinMiner, Linux.BTCMine.26, Zminer, DevilRobber, PyCryptoMiner, RubyMiner, and MassMiner, were just some of the few that were documented at the time, in the span of a few months.

As Monero price slumped, the frequency and intensity of crypto-mining operations died down over the 2018-2019 winter. They never stopped, but they did continue to operate, on a smaller scale than what we've seen in the good ol' days of 2017 and early 2018.

But as XMR trading value recovered this year, so have these operations, which are now seeing new life.

👁‍🗨It seems like with the #Bitcoin/#Monero (XMR) #coin💱overall latest positive trends 📈 lately, we should expect more cryptocurrency miner deployments again on the financial crime landscape🤔 https://t.co/zPd6OxHkRt — Vitali Kremez (@VK_Intel) June 28, 2019

Crypto-miners' hot summer

Below, we're going to summarize some of the reports published this summer by cyber-security firms that detailed new Monero-mining operations.

May 2019 - Rocke and Pascha groups - An Intezer Labs report described the battle between two crypto-mining operations that were fighting infect to same types of Linux-based cloud-based apps.

May 2019 - Nansh0u campaign - A Guardicore report details a Chinese-based crypto-mining group that infected over 50,000 Windows MS-SQL and phpMyAdmin servers to mine Monero.

May 2019 - RIG exploit kit - Trend Micro reported that the infamous RIG exploit kit had started to deploy a Monero miner as its final payload. The crypto-miner was aimed at Windows desktop users, rather than servers, like most Monero minining operations tend to be.

June 2019 - BlackSquid malware - A Trend Micro report details a new malware strain named BlackSquid. The malware can target both Windows and Linux servers, and also uses additional exploits to move laterally through networks, to infect as many systems as possible with its crypto-mining payload.

June 2019 - Unnamed campaign - Another Trend Micro report details another malware operation whose final goal is to deploy a Monero crypto-miner. Just like BlackSquid, this malware also relied on the EternalBlue exploit to spread through internal networks after compromising an initial point of entry.

June 2019 - AESDDoS botnet - Yet another Trend Micro report details how a botnet previously focused on infecting servers to carry out DDoS attacks had shifted towards delivering a Monero miner instead. This group specifically went after Docker servers.

June 2019 - Unnamed campaign - A Sucuri report described another crypto-mining malware operation that infected web servers and used a cronjob to persist on infected hosts.

June 2019 - Plurox malware - A Kaspersky report describes a new malware strain named Plurox. Targeting Windows, this malware comes with several modules for performing crypto-currency mining, in various forms.

June 2019 - LoudMiner malware - ESET researchers detail LoudMiner, a malware family that targets both macOS and Windows. According to researchers, LoudMiner uses virtualization software -- QEMU on macOS and VirtualBox on Windows -- to mine Monero on a Tiny Core Linux virtual machine.

June 2019 - ADB campaign - Trend Micro researchers detail a Monero-mining operation during which crooks scan the internet for Android devices exposing their ADB debug ports, which they then use to plant a crypto-miner on unprotected hosts.

July 2019 - WatchBog botnet - An Intezer Labs report detailed the WatchBog cryptocurrency-mining botnet,operational since late 2018, and which compromised more than 4,500 Linux machines.

August 2019 - Smominru botnet - A Carbon Black report [PDF] detailed changes in the activity of Smominru, one of the oldest and largest cryptocurrency mining botnets around. Besides running crypto-mining payloads, the botnet also stole credentials from infected hosts, which it later put up for sale online.

August 2019 - Norman malware - Security researchers from Varonis published a report on the new Norman crypto-miner. Targets Windows systems only.

September 2019 - Skidmap malware - A Trend Micro report detailed a new Linux malware strain named Skidmap, used to drop Monero miners on web servers. The malware's most significate feature is the use of a rootkit to persist on infected systems as much as possible. Skidmap was also of note because it targeted Debian and RHEL/CentOS systems only.

September 2019 - Panda group - The most recent report is one published yesterday by Cisco Talos, about a group named Panda. Cisco says the group is not sophisticated at all, but merely uses publicly available exploits to infect any web-based servers it can, spread laterally through local networks, and then drop a crypto-miner. According to Cisco, the Panda group has been seen targeting servers with exploits for Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2017-10271), Apache Struts 2 (CVE-2017-5638), and the ThinkPHP framework (CNVD-2018-24942). Besides a crypto-miner payload, the group has also been seen dropping the Gh0st remote access trojan (RAT) on infected hosts, possible for expanding access or stealing credentials.

Older crypto-mining botnets are diversifying

All the above reports show an obvious trend -- namely that there's been a spike in new crypto-mining operations over the summer.

However, according to Guardicore security researcher Daniel Goldberg, crypto-mining operations haven't stopped just because the Monero price took a dive. It's just that criminal groups haven't invested too much effort into creating new malware once Monero lost its value.

Some malware groups continued to operate, such as the Smominru botnet, about which Guardicore published today additional research, along with scripts to detect the malware's residues on infected machines.

""Attacks still exist in high intensity, because criminals have basically automated their attack tools,"" Goldberg told ZDNet in an interview today today.

This automation has allowed Smominru and other older groups like Panda, Pacha, and Rocke to continue to operate through Monero's price slump.

However, as the reports above show, once the Monero price started to rise, new malware strains have also started popping up.

One could say that keeping an eye out on the Monero or Bitcoin exchange rate could be a great way of getting early warnings when crypto-mining operations ramp up. However, Goldberg sees this as a poor indicator.

""Crypto-mining is one of many ways criminals monetize access to unprotected infrastructure,"" the Guardicore researcher said. ""If it's not crypto-mining, they'll sell access [to infected hosts to other groups], ransomware, or numerous other methods.""

And this is exactly what happened with the older botnets, such as Smominru and Panda, who, as reported by Guardicore and Cisco Talos, have added credentials-dumping components in recent months.

These additional components helped crooks steal and then sell/monetize other information from infected hosts while their primary crypto-mining operations started making less money. For example, Smominru made a profit by selling credentials for internal networks or online sites that it collected from infected hosts.

But there's also good news on the horizon. Just like it once happened with USB-spreading worms or ransomware, once something becomes a hot topic on the malware scene, cyber-security firms adapt and start providing better protections.

""Cryptominers are getting detected much more easily these days,"" Omri Segev Moyal, CEO of cyber-security firm Profero, told ZDNet in an interview today.

""When we started our research, almost no one detected cryptominers. Now it's really hard to build a proper one that stays long enough undetected to make profits.""",,https://www.coindesk.com/doj-brings-extortion-charges-against-early-advisor-to-ethereum-tzero,"UPDATE (Sept. 19, 2019, 05:15 UTC): A spokesperson for Casper Labs said Steven Nerayoff is no longer a member of its team, saying:

“We were unaware of the reported arrest and charges against Mr. Nerayoff until we read the news article ourselves. Mr. Nerayoff no longer holds any positions with CasperLabs.”

U.S. law enforcement has charged Steven Nerayoff, an early supporter of the ethereum project and a former paid advisor to Overstock’s tZero, with extortion.

Nerayoff, an attorney and founder of blockchain consulting firm Alchemist, was arrested Wednesday morning by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and was scheduled to face charges before a federal court in Brooklyn in the afternoon. The FBI also arrested Michael Hlady, an Alchemist associate.

Nerayoff and Hlady face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the alleged scheme, described as “an old-fashioned shakedown” by the United States Attorney Office’s for the Eastern District of New York (part of the Department of Justice) and “an age-old extortion scheme … with a modern-day twist” by the FBI.

Nerayoff’s attorney, Avi Moskowitz, told CoinDesk that “a civil dispute has been improperly distorted into a criminal matter. Mr. Neryaoff looks forward to the truth coming out and clearing his name.”

According to the government’s complaint, Nerayoff’s firm was tapped to advise an undisclosed, Seattle-based startup — dubbed “Company 1” in court documents – in July 2017. Nerayoff began demanding larger than contractually agreed-upon ethereum payouts for his help with the company’s initial coin offering (ICO) that coming fall, the complaint says,

Per the agreement, Nerayoff was entitled to 22.5 percent of all the cryptocurrency tokens sold during the ICO as well as 22.5 percent of all the funds raised by Company 1 “regardless of the method and manner in which [the funds] are raised.”

Before the ICO occurred, Nerayoff demanded higher compensation from Company 1 executives, identified as John and Jane Doe. Through an email sent to the company’s executives, Nerayoff demanded 30,000 ETH if the pre-sale and crowd sale surpassed 60,000 ETH in addition to a large allotment of the Company 1’s ICO token, the complaint says.

If not, Nerayoff promised to “sabotage the crowd sale, generate negative press for Company 1 and use his contacts with influential people to ‘destroy’ Company 1,” the DOJ alleged.

Company 1 agreed to the payout despite not receiving additional compensating services, the complaint says.

‘Operations guy’

The ICO raised 55,677 ETH during the pre-sale of the token. A crowd sale the following two months raised an additional 20,000 ETH, totaling 75,677 ETH raised, worth about $32 million at the time. Of the 75,766 ETH raised, Nerayoff received 30,000.

The following March, Nerayoff demanded a 10,000 ETH “loan” from Company 1 worth $4.45 million at the time, the complaint says. Nerayoff also introduced Company 1 to Hlady, his “operations guy.”

According to court documents, “Nerayoff claimed Hlady was a former government agent who could carry firearms through airports. On separate occasions, Hlady told Jane Doe … that he had been shot at and had killed people, that he had ‘taken down’ a head of state, and that he had been a part of the Irish Republican Army, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI.”

That same month, Jane Doe visited Nerayoff at his New York home and stayed the night. During the evening, Hlady entered her guest room, where she was sleeping by herself. Turning on the light and pulling a chair up to her bed, Hlady demanded the 10,000 ETH loan or they would “crush” her company, and Nerayoff later entered the room and made a similar threat, according to the complaint.

Nerayoff and Hlady continued to threaten Jane Doe through iMessages and personal threats thereafter, including telling her where her child attended school.

Jane Doe instructed a Company 1 employee to pay the 10,000 ETH loan to Nerayoff between March 28 and April 1, 2018. The loan was never repaid by Nerayoff, according to the U.S. attorney.

Roles in ethereum, tZero

Nerayoff was on the board of advisors of tZERO, Overstock’s security token trading platform, as of March 1, 2018, according to a securities filing. An Overstock press release from 2017 described him as “architect of the Ethereum ICO.”

Similar language has been used to describe his involvement with the early ethereum team. For example, his bio on the TechStars accelerator’s website states,

“Steven’s innovative work as the legal architect of Ethereum’s record setting token sale continues to be the basic structure used throughout the world today. Steven innovated the concept of ‘utility,’ specifically using the concept of ‘gas’ or ‘fuel’ for legal purposes.”

People who worked on ethereum during its early days told CoinDesk he was indeed involved, though those descriptions may be somewhat exaggerated.

For example, Nerayoff guaranteed payment on about $200,000 of legal bills for an opinion letter the team obtained from a law firm for the 2014 token sale, according to one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

He was also involved in the ideation of gas, but far from the driving force suggested by his bio, two people who worked on the early ethereum team said.

A tZero spokesperson told CoinDesk that the company “has no affiliation with Steven and his company, Alchemist. In the past, Alchemist was a paid advisor to tZERO for its [security token offering]. tZERO has since terminated the advisory relationship.”

Nerayoff is also the co-founder of Casper Labs, according to a February 2019 blog post by the company, which is researching the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that the ethereum network is expected to shift to in the future. However, his name was missing from the company’s team page as of Wednesday evening. A message to the startup was not immediately returned.

The launch has raised questions about the difference between Libra and existing cryptocurrencies, as well as the implications of private companies competing with sovereign countries in issuing currencies.

Unlike Bitcoin, which has neither an owner nor a controlling body, Libra will be governed by a Swiss foundation comprised of several members that are well-established brands, including Uber, Visa and PayPal.

Read more: Facebook’s Libra: it’s not the ‘crypto’ that’s the issue, it's the organisation behind it

Libra operates within a much more controlled environment relative to many other cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether. It also doesn’t run on a blockchain.

Instead, the book-keeping of Libra transactions is bestowed upon a set of trusted computing nodes controlled by the members of the Libra foundation. In contrast, Bitcoin is a free-for-all where anybody can join the group of computers that verify transactions.

This difference in governance structure has wide-ranging implications for the economic gains and possible risks society faces from a possible widespread adoption of new currencies like Libra.

How to grow?

A fundamental issue most fintech companies face today is scaleability. The Visa network can authorize up to 65,000 transactions per second, while Bitcoin typically processes a few hundred thousand a day.

Technically, it’s possible to expand the Bitcoin network to a commercially viable scale, but due to the lack of a governing body, several attempts to increase capacity have ended up in endless debates, fights within the community and different camps going their own ways. It’s resulted in the creation of offspring currencies such as BitcoinGold and BitcoinCash.

Libra overcomes these struggles by a well-defined governance structure where necessary technical adaptations can be efficiently decided upon in an organized manner.

But Libra decision-makers may be tempted to put their own best interests ahead of the consumers’ benefit. Recent revelations about the lack of privacy protections in place at the companies on Libra’s foundation raise concerns about how much trust users can place in Libra when they’re deciding whether to open up their financial transactions to the big internet companies on Libra’s board.

Intimate knowledge of people’s purchases, wealth and shopping behaviour has incredible value for advertising and resale to other companies. It will be up to the consortium members to credibly convince the public that they will refrain from monetizing this huge wealth of data that they sit upon.

Guard against fraud

In our traditional financial system, laws and regulators watch over privacy as well as access to the financial system. Laws not only provide privacy protections, they also guard against fraud and ensure that citizens can participate on a level playing field.

Rules are created in a democratic process. Banks in western countries cannot easily ban citizens from basic financial services, which are important to join the workforce and get established in society.

But currencies issued by private companies do not face the same scrutiny. What if Facebook decides you cannot have Libra because you posted a critical article on the internet? Your legal options would be limited.

Bitcoin’s chaotic governance structure has an advantage here. Without a governing body, there is nobody who can lock anybody else out of the system. While this approach ensures equal access, however, it also invites criminals to use Bitcoin for illicit purposes.

Creative Commons

Centuries ago, promissory notes emerged in China and were brought to Europe by Marco Polo as an early banking service that allowed merchants to travel without large sums of money due to fear they’d be robbed. Banks offered safekeeping for money, allowing the merchant to store the funds and withdraw them whenever and wherever needed.

Today, banks still spend billions of dollars on security to protect their clients’ savings. Many credit-card companies provide protection against fraudulent transactions.

No such protections exist for cryptocurrencies. No recourse is possible should a hacker gain access to your wallet or if your crypto becomes worthless. With cryptocurrencies, users must once again worry about safekeeping.

Deposit insurance

Often under-appreciated, but of great importance, is government-provided deposit insurance that provides a second layer of security, protecting depositors against the default of the bank.

Unlike Bitcoin, where prices fluctuate dramatically within a few days, Libra’s value is tied to a basket of international currencies. As users buy Libra with fiat currency, including Canadian dollars, the Libra foundation will take these dollars and invest them in safe securities.

Because Libra is backed with real and stable financial assets, the value of Libra will then also be stable. While this approach sounds great at a first glance, several problems exist that have plagued banking for centuries.

Temptations will arise to invest some of the money in riskier securities for a higher return. What if people, for some reason or another, doubt that the assets are there or think that the assets lost value? Long lines of depositors wanting to withdraw their funds from a bank that they rightfully or wrongfully believe to be troubled have been observed ever since the inception of banks.

Such bank runs are often self-fulfilling, and Libra is not immune to this problem. When users want to cash out, Libra would have to sell their assets at a large scale, causing the price of these very assets to fall and hence end up with insufficient funds to pay all investors.

As users realize what is happening, more will want to cash out, speeding up the vicious circle.

Would any government come to the rescue?

Unlike with banks, it’s unclear how possible losses will be covered and how they might be shared among users. Some U.S. money market funds that are in a similar business — investing client’s money in safe short-term assets — found themselves in similar trouble in the 2008 financial crisis and were bailed out by the government.

With Libra, it’s unclear which government would come to the rescue, if any.

All the money that users will put into Libra will be missed in the traditional banking system, where banks can put deposits to good use by providing loans to productive companies that generate value and employment. The economic consequences therefore could be far-reaching.

The foundation for Libra’s model and possible success is the banking sector’s shortcomings and inefficiencies.

While Libra might not offer many advantages to users in Western countries, it will open access to financial services for millions of people around the world without bank accounts.

Cross-border payments are in the current system ridiculously expensive and slow. Traditional banking often seems bureaucratic and technologically outdated. All these issues could be fixed by banks, but it will take outside pressure of new fintech startups to get it done.

A North Korean official claims that a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) cryptocurrency is on the horizon. According to a delegate for the Committee for Cultural Relations, Alejandro Cao de Benós, the country plans to forge a token backed by a physical commodity like gold and the digital asset’s main purpose will be used to bypass U.S. and international sanctions.

North Korea Is Building a ‘DPRK Token’

Another nation state is in the midst of creating a digital currency but the North Korean cryptocurrency idea is intended to work in parallel with the local Korean won. Alejandro Cao de Benós, a member of the DPRK Committee for Cultural Relations and President of the Korean Friendship Association, told various news outlets this week that a DPRK token is in the works. Between April 18 and 25 of this year, North Korea held a cryptocurrency and blockchain conference which saw around 100 attendees in Pyongyang. Immediately after the event wrapped up, rumors of the North Korean government creating a digital currency made mainstream headlines. News publication The Diplomat reported that early clues also started arising in September 2017 when Kim Il Sung University released a report on the importance of digital currencies. Moreover, The Diplomat columnist Tae-jun Kang said that the conference itself and the DPRK token announcement was a signal to other nation states like the U.S.

“According to several Seoul-based North Korean experts, who believe the latest cryptocurrency conference in Pyongyang was designed to send out a warning message to the United States and the international community that it can overcome sanctions by utilizing digital currencies,” Tae-jun Kang wrote in April 2019 after the conference in Pyongyang.

Now Alejandro Cao de Benós is speaking on the subject with a few select news outlets this week and has told reporters that a DPRK token is being built. Speaking with Vice journalist David Gilbert, he said the digital token North Korea is constructing is still in its nascent stages, but clearly emphasized that the cryptocurrency was made to bypass strict U.S. and international sanctions. However, the new coin created by the North Korean government will not be a digitized version of the Korean won. “[It will be] more like bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,” Cao de Benós told Gilbert during a phone conversation. The North Korean diplomat added:

We are still in the very early stages in the creation of the token. Now we are in the phase of studying the goods that will give value to it.

DPRK Token Won’t Replace the Korean Won

Alejandro Cao de Benós has also spoken with the reporter Ben Muster from Decrypt and given a greater insight to the DPRK token. In the interview, Cao de Benós highlighted that North Korean citizens would still use the Korean won and that the new blockchain assets would be used by “banks and companies.” The concept of the DPRK token is different to China and the PBOC’s alleged digital yaun construction and the idea resembles Venezuela and Maduro’s petro cryptocurrency. There have been multiple reports detailing that average Venezuelan citizens don’t even use the petro and that the digital currency is mainly used by government officials and their friends to skip out on U.S. sanctions. Moreover, similarly to the DPRK token concept, Maduro didn’t replace the sovereign bolivar either, and the petro runs parallel with the local tender and is allegedly backed by oil and gold reserves.

During Cao de Benós’ interview, he claimed that the country was developing a digital asset that’s “based on something with physical value — in the international market.” The representative also said that the crypto needs to bolster a “more stable price for international settlements, between DPRK and other companies/individuals.” The columnist Ben Muster said that he reached out to DPRK officials but “requests for comment from the North Korean government went unanswered.” When reporter David Gilbert called North Korea’s Embassy in New York, the office said they could not verify Cao de Benós’ claims. “I am not in a position to give you an answer,” the North Korean Embassy spokesperson stated.

On September 9, Cao de Benós announced the next Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference which will be held in February 2020. Just like the last event, the conference will be very exclusive but Cao de Benós has said the event will be much larger this year. Also, attendees will get a chance to visit Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and Kim Il Sung University as well. Just like the prior Pyongyang crypto conference, there will be restrictions for members of the media and citizens who reside in the U.S., Israel, South Korea, and Japan. It’s likely more information will come from the next conference in regard to the purported DPRK token. There’s been multiple reports in the past of North Korean’s gathering technical knowledge on digital currencies like bitcoin. Last week someone asked Cao de Benós if DPRK residents were allowed to hold digital assets and Cao de Benós replied:

Yes, we even have programmers that are designing crypto wallets and other related apps right now.

Venezuelan officials from Maduro’s regime have been very friendly with the North Korean government as well according to pictures Cao de Benós shared last August. The Venezuelan government opened an embassy in Pyongyang and Cao de Benós said “surely this diplomatic advance will be very useful in the defense against the imperialist invasion.” Just like Venezuela and Iran, North Korea has had issues with the U.S. for quite some time. However, with North Korea under Kim Jong-un’s rule, the country has had problems with many international bodies since holding its first nuclear test in 2006. The U.S. and a number of countries have imposed economic sanctions against the DPRK and it is hard for the region to do business with people and organizations overseas. As the popularity of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has increased, it seems that North Korean officials have begun to appreciate how this technology can be used to bypass financial blockades and borders.

The cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $177 billion, has seen a number of attempts to go mainstream, including efforts to launch exchange-traded funds that would give retail investors an easier path into the space.

However, regulators have been reluctant amid violent price swings, a string of negative headlines involving fraud and a general level of skepticism about the stability of the crypto industry. Bitcoin was trading around $9,875 Thursday, up about 54% over the past year but off 51% from its all-time high just above $20,000, according to Coinbase quotes.

This upwards momentum has allowed the cryptocurrency to surge to fresh monthly highs, and analysts are now noting that ETH may be able to drag the entire crypto markets up during the next coming days and weeks.

Ethereum Surges Past $220 as Bulls Roar

At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up over 4% at its current price of $222.87, which marks a significant surge from its recent lows of $175 that were set last week.

This upwards momentum has proven to be very positive for the aggregated crypto market and has come as most other major altcoins are surging higher.

As for what could be driving this upwards surge, multiple analysts have pointed to improving fundamentals as one potential catalyst for an ETH bull run, while others have also noted that multiple metrics may be pointing to the possibility that ETH is currently being accumulated by investors.

Sentiment, a crypto market insights provider, spoke about this in a recent tweet, pointing to declining ETH token circulation and a declining “active coin” number as signs that Ethereum is currently being accumulated.

“There’s also a number of metrics suggesting accumulation: 1. Token Circulation (# of unique ETH being used each day) continues to decline over the past 5 months… 2. Ethereum’s maximal mean age (avg. age that each coin has remained in its current address) continues to rise… 3. # of active coins over a period of 90 days has begun to decline as of recently,” they explained in the thread seen below.

Will ETH Extend Its Upwards Momentum?

Because Bitcoin is currently trading sideways in the lower-$10,000 region, it is highly likely that any upwards BTC movement could further perpetuate ETH’s momentum and send it surging even higher.

Big Cheds, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, spoke about Ethereum in a recent tweet, explaining that its latest upwards movement marks a notable breakout over its upper Bollinger Band, which may mean that further gains are imminent.

“$ETH #Ethereum – 4 hour – Big breakout,” he explained.

The coming hours may prove to be quite illuminating for ETH’s near-term price action, as Bitcoin’s price action may ultimately bolster ETH’s current surge and could allow it to post significantly higher gains.

Based on the translated proposal from the Cabinet of Iran, licensed and registered cryptocurrency miners will be required to submit information such as their list of business activities, the predicted value of their investments, current employment status, rental agreements for the space itself, the value of their mining equipment and the duration of the mining project. The license will need to be renewed every year.

Stepping back, the Iranian mining industry has grown dramatically over the past two years, thanks in part to state-subsidized electricity. For example, just one Persian Telegram group for local miners has 3,424 members. Based on a survey of more than 1,600 Iranian crypto users by the market analytics firm Gate Trade, 35 percent of respondents earned income through mining and 70 percent were interested in learning more about local mining businesses. One anonymous source in Tehran told CoinDesk that most miners he knows are “under the radar” and import equipment through the black market, without paying taxes.

As such, the Central Bank of Iran finally recognized the grassroots industry and promised a lawful licensing procedure in July 2019. This pending proposal was approved by Reza Rahmani, Iran’s Minister of Industry, Mine and Trade. The Iranian mining licenses would only apply to miners with equipment that requires 30 kilowatts, which might exclude homemade mining equipment or small operations.

However, another source in Tehran, an avid bitcoiner, told CoinDesk he supports this move because it could create the foundations for a sustainable mining industry in the country. For example, if too many miners in a single district apply, the authorities could encourage miners to distribute their operations across the region.

“It’s obvious that the power industry here in Iran, it’s not a private business, it’s from the government,” the second anonymous source said. “They need to figure out how to balance mining [operations] so that they wouldn’t harm the power grid. If there’s a constant, a continuous consumption of electricity you can also make new power plants or assign power plants to this.”

On the other hand, he still doesn’t believe this legislation will completely curtail the flood of hobbyist miners joining the bitcoin community.

“There will be a lot of underground mining operations,” he said. “I predict that this will happen, that the power grid will take a hit from the abundance of people who will do mining in their homes.”

A third source in Tehran told CoinDesk he expects Iran to become one of the world’s biggest players in the bitcoin mining sector over the next year.

Bitcoin miner image via Shutterstock",2019-09-19 18:45:18+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/what-the-holy-land-reveals-about-bitcoin,"When hundreds of entrepreneurs, investors and technologists descended on Tel Aviv Blockchain Week (TLVBW), few could have expected a better backdrop for exploring the lofty ideals and greedy impulses that drive today’s cryptocurrency industry.

Duality is something Israelis know well.

More than 430 people attended the D&DD Summit on Sept. 10, several dozen came to the Scaling Bitcoin conference on Sept. 11 and 700 attended the first Israeli Ethereal on Sept. 15, just to name a few of the week’s dozen events.

Venues were packed with crypto tourists sipping espressos and pontificating on typical blockchain fodder: token governance, “mainstream” adoption and the immaturity of those other “vaporware” shills.

But while tech-savvy Tel Aviv represented the profit-driven side of the blockchain industry, nearby Jerusalem offered TLVBW visitors the chance to commune with the timeless notions of freedom that lie at the heart of the decentralization movement.

Although cryptocurrency isn’t a panacea, it may still have unique value in this conflict-riddled land paved with ancient stones.

Startup nation

For a country of roughly 8 million people, Israel has a disproportionately large impact on the global crypto market.

International companies like Tezos, Telegram and even Facebook’s Calibra subsidiary all have teams working in Tel Aviv’s high-tech hub. Some of the industry’s biggest token sales also hailed from Israel, including Bancor, Sirin Labs and Orbs. Furthermore, Israel is home to the world’s leading researchers of zero-knowledge proofs, a privacy technology that underlies both Zcash and upcoming ethereum developments.

Youval Rouach, CEO of Israeli bitcoin exchange Bits of Gold, told CoinDesk his startup has 55,000 local users. Nir Hirshman of the Israeli Bitcoin Association (IBA) told CoinDesk there are nearly 50 blockchain startups in Israel, although few target the local market because of a conservative regulatory climate.

The industry remains largely unbanked, for example.

“No bank has agreed to open an account for us [the IBA],” IBA chairman Meni Rosenfeld said. “So we cannot even register members properly.”

Being unbanked is something many Palestinians grapple with as well, including East Jerusalemite Rami Mohammad Ali, a bitcoin miner and trader.

Ali spent his blockchain week traipsing across Tel Aviv to buy bitcoin and bring it back to his Palestinian customers. He told CoinDesk more than 50 customers buy a cumulative total of up to 20 bitcoin a month (roughly $200,000 at current prices, a fortune in poverty-stricken East Jerusalem).

“My customers always leave me with a balance of zero. No matter how much I buy, they always demand more,” he said. “I find the best price to buy in Tel Aviv and the best price to sell in Jerusalem.”

The Palestinian presence was not altogether absent from the TLVBW lineup itself. Nine Palestinians from Ramallah attended Ethereal Tel Aviv, a rare occurrence that required sponsorship from crypto startup Orbs for obtaining the necessary government permits for crossing into Israel.

One such attendee was Hiba Shabin of the Ramallah-based software company Jaffa Net, which has already worked on an ethereum pilot project for certificate sharing among educational institutions and businesses.

“I believe we should have more collaboration,” Shabin told CoinDesk, speaking of how she hopes Israeli tech companies will outsource jobs to highly educated but underemployed developers in Ramallah.

Blockchain technology can truly forge economic ties across borders. But of course, the education-focused nonprofit Tel Aviv Bitcoin Embassy attracted far fewer visitors this week than rooftop parties with venture capitalists.

Ethereal dreams

On the other hand, restrictive banking norms may be part of the reason decentralized finance (DeFi) apps like loans are booming.

Jaffa Net’s Shabin told CoinDesk she’s curious about DeFi because there are many unbanked Palestinians who could use such financial products.

“I need to do research and learn more about DeFi,” she said at Ethereal. “I only heard about it today.”

The Brooklyn-based venture studio ConsenSys announced at Ethereal the launch of its Codefi product suite for enterprises, especially the financial sector. Could the DeFi movement span the gap between the unbanked and the banks themselves? That appears to be the common belief.

Earlier that week, during Scaling Bitcoin, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin told CoinDesk his goal is to build a “more open, permissionless, decentralized system.”

Even if bitcoiners see a digital form of “hard money” as the primary tool for achieving this, and other crypto communities like Tezos prefer a token governance model, most groups at TLVBW shared that common goal.

“I don’t want to be a leader,” Tezos co-founder Arthur Breitman told CoinDesk, adding his aim was to create a broader movement full of independent contributors to a “decentralized platform for financial applications.”

Where I fit in

Despite my skepticism, I’m not one to judge conference attendees attracted to cryptocurrency. After all, I’m one of them. I’ve chanted the lines from “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous, repented for saving in fiat and even put a small amount of faith into this software.

It’s been more than a decade since I stumbled home through the winding Jerusalem alleyways, disillusioned by the American political system and hopeful that we could build a more fair and open society in a young country like Israel. I once drank the socialist Kibbutz-for-tourists Kool-Aid and participated in cross-cultural programs promoting “peace,” before I saw how the apparatus was monetizing sanitized idealism to protect the status quo. The revolution you’re promised is rarely the revolution you get.

Now here I am again, in the Holy Land, nursing the foolish dream of another mystical purpose. This time it’s finding the truth about “bitcoin adoption.”

The Bitcoin Core developers that gathered at Scaling Bitcoin in Tel Aviv University have collaboratively built an asset already used by thousands of people like Ali, the Palestinian bitcoin trader. Buterin funded and helped develop DeFi systems like Uniswap, which currently has $17.8 million of crypto locked within it, according to DeFi Pulse.

Yet even Buterin said in Tel Aviv he’s not sure how to measure arrival in that “open” promised land. The vast majority of current usage is basically gambling and wealth accumulation by people who already have full access to banks. Instead, Buterin described success as a feeling that his platform was used for “meaningful things,” a goal the community is creeping towards even if it has yet to secure a sustainable equilibrium.

In reality, we don’t know if cryptocurrency can provide a reliable safety net beyond the norms of financial censorship.

Holy Land hopium

Blockchain week was too intense, so I ran away to Jerusalem for a drink with a Palestinian friend I hadn’t seen in years.

We sat in a dark bar made of graffiti-covered stones, where the air is thick with hash smoke and oud music. To my surprise, this friend from my pre-bitcoin life told me he works for a crypto company in Tel Aviv and is bearish on bitcoin. From his perspective, regulations rule his financial life and that is unlikely to change.

Like many Palestinians, his family’s modest wealth is spread across jurisdictions with conflicting compliance standards. Proof of ownership isn’t a guarantee his family will be able to access their bank accounts or real estate. He’s not optimistic about his right to internet access garnering more respect from the authorities that provide such digital infrastructure. This would make bitcoin tricky, albeit not impossible, for his family to trust as a long-term store of value. Will using bitcoin require sophisticated computer skills?

Given the wide range of contexts that censorship can take, it’s impossible to say whether today’s brief glimpse of “open access” via cryptocurrency will go the way of MySpace, offering a fleeting moment of cultural significance before devolving into a punchline.

On the way back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv, surrounded by old ghosts on the road at midnight, I realized I haven’t escaped a form of Jerusalem syndrome, a psychiatric condition where tourists suffer a breakdown in the Holy Land and suddenly believe they are a supernatural being with a divine mission.

So I turned to Rosenfeld, the IBA chairman and veteran bitcoiner, to ask him if we’ve all simply caught a high-tech version of Jerusalem syndrome, evangelizing blockchain technology like zealots.

“Bitcoin sheds light on the disadvantages of the traditional financial system and offers some alternatives,” he said, adding:

“It’s not the solution for all things.”

Chinese market targets

Yi He, Binance co-founder and chief marketing officer (CMO) announced the news at a media session on Sept. 17, as Binance confirmed to Cointelegraph on Sept. 19.

According to the CMO, Binance’s new OTC onramp is scheduled to launch next month and only targets the Chinese market, as the current plan envisions supporting the Chinese renminbi only, a Binance spokesperson said.

To date, Binance has already set up an OTC trading desk that provides users with large transactions service, as noted by the representative. In April 2019, Binance saw an immense surge in OTC trading, reportedly recording nearly $80 million in profits.

OTC has been the main way to buy BTC with fiat in China

China has been one of the most skeptical global jurisdictions towards Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies since the Chinese government banned crypto trading in Sept. 2017. Since then, OTC trades have largely become the principal method to buy Bitcoin with fiat money in China, with local investors purchasing stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) via OTC and converting them to other crypto.

OTC is a type of trading that involves a direct deal between two interested parties and is usually conducted without supervision over exchanges.

Binance prepares the ground

Meanwhile, Binance recently initiated its first move in China since the company’s departure from the country amid the crypto trading ban back in 2017. On Sept. 17, the China-founded exchange participated in a $200 million funding round for Beijing-based Mars Finance, a local crypto and blockchain publication.",

Crypto Twitter Responds

Everybody loves a story. When it comes to how people first got into cryptocurrency, there’s no exception. Crypto Twitter (CT) is full of humorous, thought-provoking, and unexpected tales of diving down the Satoshi rabbit hole, and the reasons for entering the space are as diverse as the people themselves.

Reasons for Getting Into Bitcoin

Trawling CT, one can find many scattered gemstones and nuggets of interest about people’s discovery of Bitcoin. Recently there have been a few prominent threads asking for folks to share how they first became interested in crypto, and the reasons given fall into a few broadly defined categories. First, there’s the philosophical angle. Libertarian-minded individuals realized they could keep their own money and help to subvert the war-mongering, abusive Keynesian economic powers that be. Second, there’s the pure convenience approach, where, “hey, the stuff just works, so I’m going to use it.” There’s the tech angle and entrepreneurial angle, for those who saw the burgeoning growth of a new and lucrative industry. And finally there’s the straight “show me the money” crowd. Some tweets illustrate a little bit of everything, as well as the random, haphazard circumstances that often come into play.

The Libertarian Angle

There’s something extremely exciting, hopeful and uplifting about mantras of “bitcoin not bombs” and the prospect of real economic sovereignty. Many previously uninitiated folks found in crypto an invigorating and simple freedom. The realization that this is what money was always meant to be, and a tool to achieve greater individual freedom and quality of life for everyone. User @DougFMoeller writes:

Bitcoin is freedom to interact.

When prompted with “What was it that excited you about cryptocurrency,” user Preston Thornburg replied it was “the premise of a global currency that sees no borders.”

Crypto by Convenience

On August 23 Mycrypto.com tweeted “How did you first get into crypto / blockchain? What made you stay?” @doerkadrian replied: “Open platforms without vetting or KYC restrictions. The momentum of the tech. And the welcoming community sucked me further in.” There are also certain business models in which relative anonymity and protecting real identities are important for workers, such as escort services and purchasing substances the state has deemed illegal.

Silk Road is an oft-mentioned inspiration as well, being that many governments of the world still have an obsession with caging and violating people for peaceful possession of plant life. It’s always convenient not to get your head smashed in by police when going about your private, daily business.

Even elected government officials are testing the waters, with Berkeley Councilmember and attorney Ben Bartlett purchasing cannabis for bitcoin cash in California on September 10. As news.Bitcoin.com reported, co-founder of financial platform Cred, Dan Schatt, noted at the event: “We are thrilled to build technology that solves real problems for customers, merchants, and politicians which will help usher in the next 100 million users of crypto.”

An Innovative New Industry

Some entrants to the holy church of crypto approached not in any sort of reverent, ideological way, and not even for simple convenience. They were practical observers of a burgeoning new tech industry bringing with it myriad innovation and opportunities.

User @TimC2468 tweeted:

Wife said to me in Dec 2013 that my Christmas present was for me to learn how to mine Bitcoin. I told her I would work it like my 2nd job. I no longer need to work now. Still with my wife.

Bitcoin.com’s Executive Chairman, Roger Ver, cites a plethora of factors influencing his initial investment back in 2011, with the tech behind the project being a central one:

Show Me the Money and Other Amusing Tales

Everybody likes to have money. After all, without it, there’s not a whole lot one can do to bring their visions to life. Visions of overthrowing existing financial systems, creating a tech startup, or even securing that long-awaited moon Lambo are pretty tough to realize without a little cash flow. Some of the commenters on Twitter are well aware of this, and aiming at beachside mojitos and beyond. Others are simply chewing the fat and sharing unique crypto tales in humorous and amusing fashion.

One user going by the name Koodge wrote:

Fell off a ladder and while recovering to go back to work i found the btc white paper. Took me several weeks to pull the trigger.

Some made a point of calling out the posters of “how did you get into crypto” prompts with tongue-in-cheek retorts like “None of your business, IRS” and “Nice try IRS.” Others sardonically lamented the moment they were lowered into the nether regions of crypto Twitter by their own fatal curiosity:

Freedom: A Common Thread

Whether one is interested in getting rich quick, entering a new field, or taking down banks and governments, a common theme emerges: freedom. Freedom to do business without intrusion from third parties, to build wealth, to support charities, and to sip tropical drinks while admiring a newly purchased sports car. Simple freedom of expression and speech. The version of the internet powered by bitcoin and blockchain have the potential to facilitate these things for all. This is something even folks from vastly different philosophical and socioeconomic backgrounds can appreciate.

Crypto is presented by many as a chance to share one’s story and vision more powerfully, and a unifying force where fiat money like USD so often disempowers. Escape from even that paradigm may be possible, as noted in a since-deleted tweet from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, where he stated:

Coincidentally, new technologies raise the possibility of unstoppable tax protests.

For those tired of paying for bombs, robbery of businesses, and violence against non-violent people everywhere, the potential holds great hope for the future of Bitcoin, and for the stories of individuals who love permissionless cash around the world.

More praise for Bakkt

In a tweet on Sept. 19, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee joined the increasing number of Bitcoin figures bullish about Bakkt’s impact on the space.

The platform goes live on Sept. 23, and will first offer physical Bitcoin futures. Investors, who have been able to deposit funds since Sept. 6, will take delivery of payouts exclusively in BTC.

The remaining days to launch have so far been characterized by lackluster progress for Bitcoin markets, which dropped below $10,000 once again. Now recovering, BTC prices could nonetheless shift considerably once more in the short term. Lee wrote:

“I am very positive on Bakkt and its ability to improve trust with institutions to crypto.”

Bitcoin price tanked before BTC futures rollover date

Responses generated a further theory about current Bitcoin price weakness, which centered on Thursday’s changeover day for CME Group’s own Bitcoin futures.

As Cointelegraph reported, futures expiration and rollover dates have historically exerted pressure on Bitcoin markets.

September also saw a quieter entry into futures by cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Launching last week, figures nonetheless revealed significant open interest of $150 million, even while the product was still trading in invite-only mode.

Open interest in CME’s futures dropped to a four-month low at the same time as Bitcoin’s price performance failed to excite.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/are-tax-moves-to-puerto-rico-worth-it-for-crypto-holders,"Some in the crypto community have embraced Puerto Rico, which seems to have done a good job of promoting itself. But is it for you? I can only address the tax issues, not anything else.

To a large extent, the tax issues depend on what kind of income you will generate, whether personal or business, from where you generate it, and when the income — or even the appreciation in assets — occurs. Ideally, you want all income and all gain to come from Puerto Rico, and all the income and even the appreciation in assets to occur after you become a resident.

United States taxes

Let’s start with the assumption that many Americans feel over-taxed. We have federal taxes and in most cases state taxes, too. It is never pleasant to pay huge amounts of state taxes in California, New York or anywhere else. But now that you can deduct only $10,000 of state and local taxes on your federal income tax return, you might feel like you got lemon juice in an already painful paper cut. When it comes to state taxes, most of the movement seems to be directed to tax-free states like Texas, Florida, Washington, Wyoming or Nevada.

California’s Franchise Tax Board (FTB) has many decades of experience with Californians who might want to step across the state line precipitously close to selling their company, or those who are settling a lawsuit or some other mega-income event. How and when you take such actions can matter a lot when it comes to how you should respond to the FTB. In California, moving away because of taxes is nothing new. More recently, some people stay put but try to avoid California and other state taxes with trusts.

Puerto Rico — Too good to be true?

For taxpayers thinking on an even grander scale, some Americans even renounce citizenship, going through an exit process with the IRS and Department of State. That is much too drastic for most people. Then, there is Puerto Rico, which seems alluring. The advertisements suggest that you don’t have to actually ditch your passport, but can pay a fraction of the taxes you do now. It almost sounds too good to be true. But wait, isn’t U.S. citizens’ worldwide income taxable? Yes, but Puerto Rico is a U.S. commonwealth.

It is a part of the U.S. but in some ways still independent. Its tax system is a hybrid: part U.S., part not. If you can really move yourself and/or your business, you may be able to cut your income taxes to the bone. But as with just about all things related to taxes, you have to be careful. The interaction between the IRS and the taxman in Puerto Rico is nuanced, requiring some Puerto Ricans to file with the IRS, some with the Puerto Rico Department of Finance, and some with both. Still, Puerto Rico hopes to lure American mainlanders with an income tax of only 4%.

Legally avoiding the 37% federal rate and an additional 13.3% in California (and in other states as well) sounds pretty good. What’s more, there is no tax on dividends, and no capital gains tax in Puerto Rico. However, some big cautions are in order.

Move, then sell?

First — and this seems to be the most common question tax-weary people ask about Puerto Rico — forget about easily avoiding U.S. tax on the appreciation in your assets before you move. That’s right, it is worth stressing this point.

If you move with appreciated stock, Bitcoin or other property and then sell, all that appreciation before the move is still subject to U.S. tax. You might be a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico by the time you sell, but you still have to pay U.S. tax on all the pre-move appreciation in your assets. Only your post-move appreciation will be subject to the special tax rules in Puerto Rico. In fact, to escape U.S. tax on all of the pre-move appreciation, you generally must wait a full 10 years after you move. But 10 years is a long time, so the “move, then sell” idea is hardly a quick fix.

What about moving to Puerto Rico and then selling your U.S. real estate? The answer: That will always be U.S. source income. That means it is fully taxed in the U.S., even if you move to Puerto Rico, and even if you wait 10 years before selling. What about selling California real estate? You guessed it, not only is that always U.S. source income, but it is always California source income, too.

If you are just thinking about a move next door to Nevada, can you move to Nevada and then sell your California real estate? Yes, of course, but you have to pay California taxes on that sale even if you are no longer a resident. But cheer up, stock or Bitcoin is usually different.

Returning to Puerto Rico, there are other fundamentals about the rules, too. First, as with any move, you have to actually move. Your tax home — i.e., your real home — must be in Puerto Rico. Remember, just like any move from one state to another, it has to be real. Try to avoid messy facts that don’t look like a permanent move. If possible, sell your home, move your family, sever connections to your old local clubs, and so on.

After all, if you are later ruled not to be a Puerto Rico resident, the IRS is back in the picture asking for back taxes, penalties and interest. To qualify for the special benefits, an individual must not have been a resident of Puerto Rico within in the last 15 years. You must become a resident of Puerto Rico by Dec. 31, 2035, and you must reside there for at least 183 days a year. You also have to do the paperwork, filing an application with the tax authority there.

Once it is approved, it becomes a binding contract, promising you: 1) tax-free interest and dividends earned after you become a resident, 2) no long-term capital gains tax on appreciation after you become a resident, and 3) 5% tax on long-term capital gains for appreciation before you move for any sales during your first 10 years as a resident.

Puerto Rico also has attractive incentives for business owners. But once again, you actually have to move the company, employees, and so on. Have you ever noticed that when it comes to taxes, nothing seems to be simple?",,https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/09/151784-square-fills-out-crypto-bitcoin-dream-team-with-three-new-hires/,"Financial services company Square Inc. (NASDAQ:SQ), co-founded in 2009 by Jim McKelvey and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, has announced three new hires to the company’s Bitcoin-services development division.

According to the company, Wallace is a former developer from Lightning Labs, the company behind the Lightning Network, a “scaling solution” for Bitcoin designed to expedite transactions by settling them in aggregate off-chain- for a fee.

Czyz’s LinkedIn profile indicates he currently programs software at Google in San Francisco.

Sosman has lately been working on Calibra, the proposed digital wallet system intended to house and help circulate Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency, Libra.

“This completes our inaugural developer team,” Square tweeted regarding the hires, “as well as step 1 of our plan to grow the FOSS (free and open-source software) bitcoin developer base with gifted new contributors.”

Matt Corallo is another recent hire to the team.

Corallo is a former Bitcoin Core programmer esteemed by others for his work attempting to improve how Bitcoin mining works, and for his contributions to the development of the Lightning Network.

Square CEO Dorsey has stated many times that he hopes that Bitcoin becomes the native currency of the Internet.

Dorsey said he assembled the Square’s crypto division in order to strengthen Bitcoin, which was designed to be a payments network and/or “store of value” controlled by no single entity.

Critics have described the system as a Ponzi and pyramid scheme, and ongoing volatility and allegations of market manipulation have tarnished Bitcoin’s reputation as a store of value.

Square’s recent tweets suggest the company may be looking for ways to profit from its Bitcoin contributions:

“Speaking of the team, we are still looking for a very senior designer. This position is bigger than a single product, and will play a major role in formalizing how the world interacts with bitcoin.”

Square’s medium blog post describing its search for a Senior Designer also suggests the company is looking to make a hybrid contribution that benefits both Bitcoin and Square:

“Square Crypto is making Design part of our core, offering a unique opportunity for a designer to help shape the future of how Bitcoin will be brought into the mainstream. Unlike traditional design roles at cryptocurrency companies, this is a chance to focus on establishing the long term design vision of Bitcoin. You will work within the Square Crypto team and engage the broader open source developer community in order to make tangible forward progress toward this vision.”",2019-09-15,https://www.ccn.com/the-business-blockchain-author-predictions/,"

‘The Business Blockchain’ author predicts massive price spikes for major cryptocurrencies. | Image: Shutterstock

On Wednesday, the author of the book “The Business Blockchain: Promise, Practice, and Application of the Next Internet Technology,” William Mougayar, took to Twitter to share his fearless forecast on the possible year-end prices of top cryptos.

The crypto tokens that made Mr. Mougayar’s list include bitcoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Binance Coin among others.

What immediately caught our attention is the author’s predictions on the top two cryptos. Mr. Mougayar believes that bitcoin will print a new all-time high before the end of the year. Also, he thinks that Ethereum will be back at $1,000, which means a growth of over 360% in three months.

While everything is certainly possible in the world of cryptocurrencies, we asked around to see if active traders shared the author’s sentiment. We were not surprised to see their responses.

Analysts: Bitcoin Trading at $25,000 Before Year-End Possible But Unlikely

We asked seven technical analysts with sizable followings on Twitter if they see the number one cryptocurrency breaking the all-time high (ATH) and trading at $25,000 before the turn of 2020. Most of them said it is possible but it is doubtful.

For instance, Trader Max, also known as Bitcoin Jack said,

I doubt it, but who knows. Bitcoin will be Bitcoin.

The analyst added,

If we close the weekly above 11.6-11.7K I think there is a chance to reach for ATH this year. For now, sideways corrective seems most likely.

When asked the same question, cryptocurrency analyst Cole Garner replied,

It is possible but unlikely.

It’s the same story for Hsaka. The day trader said,

Anything is possible. I think it is highly unlikely though.

Beastlorion also said the same thing:

Anything is possible but I highly doubt it.

Scott Melker also responded to our query. He said,

Anything is possible. I would not be surprised at all.

Ian McMillan, CMT, also shared his view. The trader is less optimistic as he replied,

No, I do not.

The only trader who said that bitcoin will trade at $25,000 before the year expires is the biggest bull on CryptoTwitter (CT): Majin. The trader replied,

Yes.

Thus, it is safe to assume that traders are not expecting anything big from the king of cryptocurrencies, at least for this year. Their expectations are even lower for Ethereum.

Analysts: Ethereum Is Not Likely to Grow Exponentially in a Few Months

In the case of Ethereum, we asked a few traders if the number two cryptocurrency will climb to $1,000 before the end of the year. Just like bitcoin, most of them believe that it is possible but not likely.

For example, Bitcoin Jack replied,

Anything is possible as we have seen for example in December 2017 with Bitcoin and subsequently with alts after that, but a 5x in price for Ethereum will require some rather groundbreaking fundamental developments.

Scott Melker responded,

If BTC can break it’s all time high, Ethereum should be able to as well.

Beastlorion said,

I don’t think it will get that high but again, anything is possible.

Lastly, Benjamin Blunts gave us his full analysis. The Elliotician told CCN.com,

From a technical point of view the decline from the $360 highs down to the $160 lows is too deep to be considered part of an uptrend. [It is] more the start of a new downtrend, where any strength up towards $280, I would consider a counter trend move.

It looks like traders who possess the expertise to predict price action do not share the author’s fearless forecasts.",2019-09-20 15:00:22+00:00,https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/100000-bitcoin-2022-bitmex-ceo-backs-prediction/,"Bitcoin to Hit Six Digits

Despite a recent price lull, BitMEX’s chief executive, Arthur Hayes, is still bullish on Bitcoin. At Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore, which Bloomberg reported on, the industry executive explained that he believes Bitcoin is ready to hit six digits within the next years.

In his remarks, Hayes stated that BTC will hit $100,000 for the first time within the next three years. Crazy!

Why BTC Will Appreciate

Hayes’s latest prediction comes shortly after he touted a shorter-term $20,000 target for Bitcoin. For those who missed the memo, the industry executive wrote on Twitter that once the Federal Reserve starts to activate quantitative easing again, BTC could easily hit $20,000.

Quantitative easing is an unorthodox monetary policy popularized after 2008’s Great Recession. It sees central banks pump liquidity into asset markets to drive growth and push up the value of said assets.

Travis Kling, a former portfolio manager at a leading Wall Street fund that dived down the “Bitcoin rabbithole”, has explained on multiple occasions that policies like QE and low (even negative) interest rates are a bid “amongst central bankers to devalue their currencies ASAP”.

He writes that with the “entire world racing” to see who can devalue their fiat currency the fastest, assets with “PROVABLE SCARCITY” should begin to shine. By this, he is obviously referring to something like Bitcoin. As Kling said at a recent event:

“Bitcoin is currently a risk asset. But it’s a risk asset with a specific set of investment characteristics that will only become more attractive the more irresponsible monetary and fiscal policy becomes.”

A Bit Too Optimistic?

Although there are clear catalysts hinting at an impending growth cycle for the cryptocurrency markets, $100,000 by 2022/2023 may be a bit too optimistic.

In 2013, Bitcoin’s market capitalization surmounted $1 billion and $10 billion; in late-October of 2017, the same metric passed $100 billion. According to analytics site Bytetree, the next time Bitcoin’s network value reaches a new order of magnitude will be in 2025 — some six years away.

Analyst Charlie Morris wrote in the note that using a logarithmic chart, we can observe that for most of its life, Bitcoin has had an internal rate of return (IRR) of 212% per annum, which means that each year, investors have trebled their capital. However, this changed in the bear market of 2018, which resulted in Bitcoin losing the trend line due to overwhelming sell pressure and the absolute absurdity of a 212% compounding yearly growth rate ($100 would turn into $8.7 million after a decade).

While Bitcoin losing a nine-year-long trend seems harrowing, Morris goes on to point out that Bitcoin has entered into a new trend, one defined by an IRR line of 115% per annum. Should this trend continue, the analyst writes, Bitcoin could “touch a trillion dollars by 2025”, which equates to around $50,000 per coin, then $100,000 the year next.

Unveiled this week, Wells Fargo Digital Cash uses R3’s Corda Enterprise software to handle internal book transfers, when funds move from a payer’s account to a payee’s account at the same bank.

“When we move money across the world and we need to exchange currencies, we have to go through third parties such as SWIFT and other banks,” said Lisa Frazier, head of the Innovation Group at Wells Fargo. “That’s a long process and every time there’s a connection with external parties, it takes time and energy and effort.”

Using the digital cash would allow the bank to move funds 20 hours a day, up from only six to nine hours, five days a week when it relies on wire transfers and systems like SWIFT, Frazier said.

She told CoinDesk:

“It’s faster than SWIFT, cheaper and definitely more efficient.”

Today, for internal book transfers between branches in different countries, the bank needs to use SWIFT. This is not the case for domestic internal book transfers.

The blockchain project, which will go into a pilot phase next year after a successful proof-of-concept, “will allow those locations to exchange digital cash among themselves,” Frazier said.

As with rival megabank JPMorgan’s JPM Coin, Wells Fargo’s digital cash will be backed 1-for-1 with the analog kind. “We will hold the fiat currency, so it’s a stablecoin, and we will issue digital cash tokens. These tokens are placed into digital wallets and then those tokens are able to be exchanged,” Frazier said.

Parallel paths

Frazier said Wells Fargo has been avidly participating since 2016 in blockchain tests that she described as “external,” meaning other banks and financial institutions were involved. However, the bank has also been busy pursuing internal use cases for distributed ledger technology (DLT), she said.

“I think the surprise is, we have found a really solid internal application for DLT on our book transfers. By doing this we are streamlining the book transfer process and are reducing the use of intermediaries that can cause a delay in settlement. Therefore we are widening the operating window for clearing of FX wires cross-border,” she said.

The stablecoin project also happens to be the first project the bank has built using the paid-for version of R3’s DLT, which Wells Fargo has now licensed — with more to follow on the platform, the bank added.

SWIFT declined to comment, but the messaging system itself is collaborating with R3 on a number of projects, such as a proof of concept to connect the former’s gpi to the latter’s Corda to enable “off-ledger” payment settlement. The results of this PoC will be revealed at Sibos 2019. Corda Settler, the Corda Network’s open-source payments engine, has also been tested with the cryptocurrency XRP.

However, Wells Fargo scotched any suggestion the bank would be connecting its digital coins to anything outside its own internal payments systems.

“R3’s Corda Enterprise was selected as the platform for our first enterprise DLT network, not CordaSettler,” said a spokesman for the bank. “Wells Fargo Digital Cash is an internal settlement service which will not be associated or connected to any other potential digital cash solutions emerging in the financial services markets today.”

Alex Lipton, a former bank executive, trader and quant, said Wells Fargo’s coin is potentially very useful for simplifying the “bank’s byzantine internal processes,” but not something that will see much usage outside the bank and a handful of close partners.

“Large banks are so bad that they have to use SWIFT like everyone else, so in effect, they don’t differentiate between inside and outside of banks. So, a coin can help. But it is a sign of desperation,” said Lipton, now co-founder and chief technical officer at fintech firm Sila.

Another JPM Coin?

At first blush, Well Fargo’s digital cash may appear to be another JPM Coin, the much-vaunted technology built using Quorum, the privacy-centric version of ethereum developed by JPMorgan.

Although initially intended for payments between clients, the coin will eventually be used to digitally fund enterprise blockchain projects such as on-chain debt issuances, JPMorgan executives have said.

JPM also boasts 344 banks on its Interbank Information Network (IIN), which uses Quorum to eradicate pain points in the way information circulates within foreign correspondent banking.

Frazier played down any similarities between JPM Coin and Wells Fargo Digital Cash. “I think they are very different,” she said.

Wells Fargo is not a member of IIN, but Frazier hinted at a long-term plan for interoperability.

She concluded:

“Eventually in the future, there will be interoperable networks. As these emerging technologies come out of a nascent stage all kinds of things can happen.”

There's already an options contract in the bitcoin market at international online venues like Deribit, but that trading originates overseas, so technically U.S. participants can't trade in it directly, though they can through intermediaries, including via some trading firms in Chicago. Still, that makes it ""cumbersome"" for U.S.-based participants trying to trade in existing bitcoin options because the market is ""fragmented,"" says Brandon Elsasser, a Chicagoan who is the chief investment officer for the cryptocurrency hedge fund Victoria Capital. As a result, liquidity in that nascent market hasn't pooled as much as traders prefer, he said. There's been some anticipation in the market that CME would launch an options contract to follow its futures contract, and market participants hope it will help pool the liquidity in the bitcoin options market, Elsasser said. Victoria Capital has about $5 million under management and Elsasser also is a consultant in the industry.

Traders prefer more trading liquidity in any market because it creates more opportunities for buying and selling contracts.

While the 7,000 a day in bitcoin futures contracts traded at CME currently may seem paltry, Elsasser said that's a significant amount, given that each contract represents five bitcoins. Today, bitcoin was trading at about $10,155, according to CoinDesk. ""That's actually a pretty good amount of volume compared to the spot exchanges locally,"" said Elsasser, referring to other exchanges that trade the currency itself.

Bitcoin has been incredibly volatile since trading in it has picked up in recent years, which is one reason it and other cryptocurrencies have attracted the interest of Chicago's professional traders, including DRW Holdings' Cumberland unit. Traders seek out some degree of volatility because price swings lead to more opportunities for profits on buying and selling of any asset.

Many participants in the cryptocurrency markets have been hoping big institutions like banks, pension funds and endowments would start trading in the cryptocurrency markets because that will help deepen the pool of liquidity, but that interest has been slow in arriving. CME said today that about 3,300 customer accounts have traded its bitcoin futures since their launch.

""Based on increasing client demand and robust growth in our Bitcoin futures markets, we believe the launch of options will provide our clients with additional flexibility to trade and hedge their bitcoin price risk,"" said Tim McCourt, CME's global head of equity index and alternative investment products. ""These new products are designed to help institutions and professional traders to manage spot market bitcoin exposure, as well as hedge bitcoin futures positions in a regulated exchange environment.""",2019-09-20 08:28:21-05:00,https://www.coindesk.com/ciphertrace-scout-app-takes-crypto-investigations-mobile,"Blockchain forensics firm CipherTrace has developed a mobile tool for flagging bitcoin and ethereum tokens with a criminal past.

Announced today, CipherTrace Scout grants street-level investigators more freedom to identify, track and document illicit crypto transactions from the field, company representatives and law enforcement experts said.

The software builds on a suite of investigatory tools investigators already use. An app-based interface “traces” addresses through the blockchain to identify what coins may have been used by the crypto underworld, in dark market purchases or in ransomware extortion attacks.

Users input an address and CipherTrace Scout generates an instant report. It flags potentially criminal addresses “with a high degree of certainty,” according to Julio Barragan, a financial crime and compliance analyst at CipherTrace.

“You can imagine some beat cop in a high risk area, literally finding something that appears to be tainted,” Barragan said. “He can share a case with an analyst at headquarters and that analyst could do the tracing very quickly to determine where the source of the funds were.”

Casey Bohn, a high-tech crime specialist and educator for the National White Collar Crime Center who trains agents to use CipherTrace, said that the new technology will be of immediate use in the field.

“I think a scenario like this [CipherTrace Scout], where I can put an address in and see: ‘hey, this [address] has been involved in some sort of nefarious activity,’ I think that can be huge,” Bohn, who teaches law enforcement officials how to use tracking services, said. “You can almost rule in and rule out things at that point.”

New Spin on an Old Service

Federal agencies, police investigators and auditors already use cryptocurrency tracking software for finding crooks.

The Internal Revenue Service contracted crypto transaction tracer Chainalysis from 2015 through at least 2017. Then, America’s tax service called the software “necessary to identify and obtain evidence on individuals using bitcoin” for criminal dealings.

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents cross-reference ransomware attacks against an internal database called the Internet Crime Complaint Center, which maintains a list of every such instance. They also use a blockchain-based tool to process victim addresses.

Federal agents want to move their tracing ever deeper. In a pre-solicitation document at the end of last year, the Department of Homeland Security mulled the feasibility of tracing privacy tokens, which confound easy research with complex security.

Technologies such as CipherTrace and Chainalysis now pervade law enforcement agencies across the country, according to Bohn, the tech crimes expert. He says that Chainalysis is something of a federal standard.

But CipherTrace Scout builds on what Bohn called a law enforcement favorite: visualization.

“We can visualize the transactions [using the software]. I can see ‘from A to B” and then I can start pivoting from there in a visual manner, which is often times easier for someone to understand.”

“I like the visualization, the students like the visualization,” he noted.

Adapting to Trends

CipherTrace Scout’s rollout comes alongside a spike in street-level cryptocurrency use.

Bohn said law enforcement partners reported a surge in low-level uses cases: prostitution, drug sales, child pornography trades.

“We have found that your drug dealer on the street has gotten savvy. They’ve gotten a little more savvy and they have started to develop these trades online, using other cryptocurrencies.”

Barragan, the CipherTrace analyst, credits the proliferation of Bitcoin ATMs and other crypto-capable kiosks.

“There are approximately 900 Coinstar machines embedded in Safeways across the U.S. that spit out crypto,” he said. “It’s becoming very very easy anyone to acquire crypto, and it’s starting to be used for street crimes.

The Scout flags nefarious addresses. But it also ignores every-day users, a feature Bohn calls critical.

“While there is criminal activity that occurs with these technologies, there’s a lot of normal, regular people who are taking part in this technology as well.”

According to the announcement, cryptocurrency payments that are subject to the provision of services under Article 9 (27) (d) of Portuguese tax law are exempt from VAT. This applies only to individuals, as Portugal-based businesses are still subject to several taxes such as VAT, social security and income taxes.

This announcement follows another Portuguese tax benefit for cryptocurrency traders: Ruling 5717/2015, which declares that proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies for individuals will be tax free. According to the ruling published in February 2018, the sale of cryptocurrencies does not qualify as capital gains if the tokens are derived from the sale of financial products as defined in Portuguese law, which are normally subject to a 28% tax rate. In addition, cryptocurrency trading will not be considered investment income, which is also subject to a 28% tax rate under other circumstances.

As the ruling applies only to individuals, business income derived from trading or other activities are subject to progressive rates for personal income tax.

To anyone who is familiar with the Portuguese tax regime, these two rulings are not surprising. In fact, Portugal is considered to be a very friendly country for taxpayers, with regulations specially designed to attract wealthy and high-net-worth individuals.

While customarily paid in many other countries, Portugal has no inheritance, gift or wealth taxes levied on its residents.

These significant tax benefits are reserved for nonregular tax residents in a bid to attract high-value professionals from all over the world. Multiple professions within STEM and the arts are considered to be of high value and range from architect to investor.

These high-value, nonregular groups enjoy a 25% rate on income taxation, avoid a tax of up to 48% that is applied to other resident groups, and pay a 28% tax rate on dividends, capital gains and investment income — which is why the Portuguese government including cryptocurrency investors and traders comes as no surprise.

If all of the above is convincing enough to relocate to Portugal, the residency rules are worth checking.

A person is considered a resident of Portugal if they spend more than 183 days (consecutive or not) in Portugal during any 12-month period. A person who becomes a tax resident in Portugal and has not been taxed as a resident in Portugal for the previous five years may apply for the special tax regime for nonhabitual tax residents. However, in five years’ time, there might be more countries treating cryptocurrency trading as a tax-free activity.

A leading analyst recently came out to issue his thoughts on the debate.

Bitcoin > Crypto?

Since 2017’s crypto-mania, there has been a mass hubbub about altcoins. You see, during the previous bull cycle, cryptocurrencies that were not BTC saw massive gains against both Bitcoin and the U.S. dollar. Ethereum, for instance, moved higher by over 100x within a 15-month period, rallying from single digits to effectively $1,400 by early-2018. This trend resulted in Bitcoin dominance — the metric used to define how much of the cryptocurrency market’s value is derived from BTC only — fall from well above 90% to 33%. At the time, many altcoin traders were yelling from the rooftops that the king was dead and the era of altcoins was upon this nascent market.

But, Willy Woo, a leading on-chain analyst and a partner at Murad Mahmudov’s Adaptive Capital, has argued that investing in altcoins may actually not be as wise as some shills say.

In a recent tweet, he said that altcoins are “highly correlated to Bitcoin“, and thus don’t act as portfolio diversifiers. Instead, cryptocurrencies “only increase portfolio risk”, Woo explained.

…and for the record, alt-coins are highly correlated to BTCUSD. Buying alts in an attempt to diversify only increases portfolio risk. This is why I am not a fan of alt-coin index baskets. https://t.co/y6HNIziZAR — Willy Woo (@woonomic) September 21, 2019

While he didn’t elaborate on that cryptocurrency investment thesis in the above tweet, he expanded on his thoughts on Bitcoin maximalism in an earlier message. Woo at the time said that while cynics say Bitcoin is “old tech, too slow, [and legacy],” it is the only cryptocurrency with a solidified Lindy Effect — which is the theory that the longer a technology/asset stays alive, the more survivability it has. Bitcoin, of course, is a first mover in the cryptocurrency space, and clearly has the largest network effects, despite its lack of ICO reserve or venture capital fund.

Woo thus concluded that Bitcoin is the “only coin” that he’d “park funds in if [he] was forced to HODL 10 years without selling”

People say Bitcoin is old tech, too slow, legacy. Even if true, very arguable, nothing in crypto comes close to the Lindy Effect that BTC has established; hence it’s valuation dominance. It’s the only coin that I’d park funds in if I were forced to HODL 10 years without selling. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) August 22, 2019

Don’t Forget Altcoin Seasons

While a Bitcoin-centric portfolio may be best in the long run, some analysts have suggested that altcoins may embark on a rally of their own — an “altseason”, if you want to call it that.

Prominent trader Dave the Wave noted that the Moving Average Convergence Divergence trend indicator on BTC dominance’s one-week trend has started to roll over, implying a loss of steam of Bitcoin against altcoins.

That’s not all. As trader Crypto Birb points out, the altcoin market capitalization chart looks eerily like the “Wall Street Cheat Sheet” cycle diagram that has become somewhat of a rallying cry for Bitcoin and altcoin bulls alike. Should the diagram play out in reality, altcoins will begin to push higher into the end of the year, potentially doubling across the board by year’s end, per Birb’s pseudo-prediction.

You don’t have to be a bitcoin purist or tech tinkerer to want to accept cryptocurrency without using a third party. With lower merchant fees, greater network uptime, and no chargebacks, noncustodial crypto payments have several advantages over traditional fiat payment systems. Here are six noncustodial options for accepting crypto in-store and online.

Accept Crypto With No Questions Asked

For merchants interested in accepting cryptocurrency in-store or online, there’s now a wealth of options. Major companies like Coinbase and Bitpay dominate the industry, with the latter’s custodial solution promising to insulate the retailer from the volatility of crypto. But that’s not all custodial solutions protect the merchant from. Due to the permissioned nature of these payment systems, retailers risk running afoul of the terms of service and having their account closed, which occurs more frequently than you might think – just ask Gab.com.

Should any of your customers hail from countries that are subject to U.S. sanctions, for instance, you’re in danger of having your account shuttered by a U.S. payment provider. The fact that you’re transacting in cryptocurrency won’t save you when you’re using a custodial solution. There are greater reasons why it may be desirable to seek a noncustodial crypto payment solution. Doing so brings greater privacy, grants you sole ownership of funds the moment the transaction clears, and is a far truer way to transact with cryptocurrency, without intermediaries.

Atomicpay

Atomicpay is a noncustodial payment application that supports seven cryptocurrencies including BCH, BTC, LTC, and DASH. It’s user-friendly, offers price conversion into over 150 fiat currencies, and has good privacy practices built in, including generating a new address for every transaction. You can integrate Atomicpay into an ecommerce module such as Woocommerce, and it’s easy to generate payment buttons to embed on your site.

Atomicpay is also suitable for use in physical stores. It offers API integration and the ability to generate a payment invoice in just a few seconds. In terms of fees, Atomicpay charges a reasonable 0.7-0.9% per transaction, with the Personal plan requiring no KYC to get started. Upgrade to the Business plan, however, and you’ll be required to undergo KYC. Greater cryptocurrency support, such as ETH, would be useful, as would additional ecommerce modules, which are listed as coming soon. That aside, Atomicpay provides a good all-round option for merchants desiring a noncustodial solution.

CMM Pay

CMM Pay is a British-based payment startup whose noncustodial service only launched at the start of the month. BTC is the sole major crypto supported at present, although additional assets are on their way. Setup takes less than five minutes and, as a noncustodial payment solution, there’s no need to undergo KYC. CMM Pay’s standard fee is 1%, though for a limited time this has been waived altogether. Features include 24-hour customer support and a merchant dashboard for viewing cryptocurrency sales, business wallet balances, and a host of other metrics.

8Pay

8Pay is a noncustodial payment system with a twist – several twists in fact. Operating on the Ethereum network, it provides on-demand and recurring payments between retailer and customer. This makes it possible to set up subscription-based payments for goods and services. The best part about all this is it’s achievable without sacrificing decentralization: 8Pay is noncustodial and requires no KYC. The only downside is that as an Ethereum-only solution, it’s limited to ETH and ERC20 tokens including stablecoins. There’s good reason for this though: implementing the sort of features that 8Pay’s built into its payment protocol calls for utilizing smart contracts of the sort which most other crypto networks can’t support.

Once 8Pay’s web and mobile apps are rolled out, it will be possible for shoppers to subscribe to on-demand and replenishment-based services (think movies, music, toiletries, household essentials, utility bills) with tokens deducted from their crypto wallet at fixed intervals until they choose to cancel the arrangement. 8Pay also features payment buttons, unique payment links, and the ability to generate invoices on the fly.

Coinbase Commerce

Coinbase attracts flak for some of its executive decisions, and it’s not opposed to deplatforming users of its exchange for the flimsiest of reasons. It’s hard to take exception to the company’s merchant payment solution however. Coinbase Commerce is noncustodial, easy to set up and charges no fees. BCH, BTC, ETH, LTC, and USDC are all accepted, and the interface is neatly designed. It claims to have more than 2,000 merchants using Coinbase Commerce already.

Blockonomics

A BTC-only service with a host of advanced features, Blockonomics is a noncustodial solution for crypto-savvy merchants. It’s not hard to use if you’re familiar with cryptocurrency, but there’s a lot going on here. A range of ecommerce plugins are complemented by enterprise invoicing and the ability to accept BTC into your existing wallet including hardware wallets for added security.

Bitcoin Cash Register

About as simple as a merchant application gets, Bitcoin Cash Register is an Android and iOS application developed by Bitcoin.com. All you need to get started is the public key to your BCH wallet. It’s simple because cryptocurrency is meant to be simple. There’s no need for second layer solutions, payment channels or custodians to convert crypto into fiat and vice-versa when the customer can just press a button and funds are despatched directly to the merchant’s wallet in seconds. Bitcoin Cash Register is limited by being BCH-only, but in every other respect, it’s the perfect example of what a noncustodial crypto payment solution should be.

This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release.

The team behind Bankera, which is building the bank for the blockchain era, has announced the release of its very own lending solution – ​ Bankera Loans​. The solution aims to provide flexible and secure crypto-backed loans to cryptocurrency holders globally starting from as low as 100 EUR up to as high as 1M EUR.

Bankera Loans acts as an alternative medium for crypto owners who need quick access to financing, but do not want to liquidate their positions. The solution offers clients a possibility to take out loans by pledging cryptocurrencies as collateral and retaining the ownership of their assets.

Crypto-backed loans for individuals and businesses

While the concept of crypto-backed loans is not entirely new as the surge of cryptocurrencies in 2017 precipitated a rise in crypto-based lending platforms, current solutions tend to overlook clients looking for smaller loans.

Bankera Loans aims to democratize access to core banking services for all cryptocurrency market participants by providing flexible loan solutions suited to both individuals and businesses.

“We see a big interest from the community in smaller crypto-backed loans. This market has been heavily underserved, and typical loan minimums in the current market are often too high. Bankera Loans solution offers our clients the possibility to take a loan as low as 100 EUR so that all clients can obtain the financing they need”, Bankera’s co-founder Vytautas Karalevičius explained.

The solution also welcomes business clients looking to utilize their crypto assets to get quick financing for leveraging positions, expanding the business, and more.

How does the lending process at Bankera Loans work?

Taking out a loan at Bankera is a simple process. After completing a quick ​ sign-up​ , the customer should deposit assets to Bankera Loans wallet that can be later used as collateral; then the customer can personalize the loan terms by choosing a preferred loan amount, loan duration, as well as withdrawal and collateral currencies. As soon as the application is approved, the client will receive a loan to the Bankera Loans account.

Bankera Loans customers can choose among a number of major fiat or cryptocurrencies for withdrawing their crypto-backed loans. Currently, the platform supports Euro (EUR), Banker (BNK), Tether (USDT), Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), NEM (XEM), and Dash (DASH) currencies with more to be added in the future. Bankera’s own Banker (BNK) token holders can take advantage of lower interest rates by choosing BNK as the currency for interest payments.

Having analyzed the market carefully, the company offers competitive rates and no hidden fees. Repayments are possible at any time while interest payments are debited automatically every month from the client’s loans wallet.

Bankera Loans is already the third product within Bankera’s ecosystem, following the company’s first solution – the cryptocurrency brokerage SpectroCoin, which was released back in 2013, has now reached one million customers. In addition, the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading platform Bankera Exchange had launched at the beginning of this year.

About Bankera

Bankera aims to become the bank for the blockchain era and is actively working to build an ecosystem of products and services that would encompass the best of both traditional finance and crypto economy.

Bankera’s digital bank will offer financial services such as savings and loans accounts, low-cost investment products, and crypto funds. This essentially merges the banking and blockchain worlds together.

One of the biggest differences between cryptocurrency and fiat currency relates to personal responsibility. Sure, you generally have to avoid being financially wasteful with your dollars and cents, but if you happen to use your credit card to buy goods online that never turn up, for instance, banks usually get your money back for you.

In other words, while the legacy financial system often enables and justifies its corrupt existence by letting its exploited customers remain in a state of dependent, benighted innocence, cryptocurrency tends to require people to take more responsibility for themselves and their personal holdings. Because if you lose access to your Bitcoin wallet or funds, that's usually it: you've lost your bitcoin for the rest of time.

But actually, that isn't always it, since there are a growing number of cryptocurrency recovery services which, in some cases, help people regain access to once inaccessible wallets. However, just how successful are they?

Bitcoin recovery services: what do they do?

“[Recovery services] basically attempt to recover the cryptocurrency holding(s) stored in a presently inaccessible wallet,"" explains Arkady Bukh of the Bukh Law Firm and Bitcoin Recovery Co., writing to Cryptonews.com. ""There could be a variety of underlying reasons, the most common is loss of a password and a wallet itself.""

Aside from helping people regain access to their software wallets, certain recovery services can also help people regain access to hardware wallets. This is something offered by, among others, Wallet Recovery Services, whose ""Dave Bitcoin"" tells Cryptonews.com that he has been helping people recover lost bitcoin since 2013.

""The most common problem for people is forgetting their password to their electronic wallet,” he says.

“There are also hardware wallets, such as Ledger or Trezor, which are often protected by pass phrases or mnemonics, which can be lost or forgotten […] I have developed a suite of sophisticated software which can often find the missing password or information and recover the coins. Normally this involves the use of multiple high speed computers to iterate through the massive search space.""

In addition, to remembering forgotten passwords via a variety of 'brute force' methods, certain recovery services are able to repair corrupted hard drives on which a cryptocurrency wallet has been stored. The UK-based MJM Data Recovery is one of these services, as explained to Cryptonews.com by its managing director, Mike Montgomery.

""When a user suffers a hard drive or USB stick failure and their bitcoin wallet is stored on that device, it is worth getting the drive to us at MJM Data Recovery Ltd where we can examine the fault, make repairs and then recover the bitcoin wallet. Note that a data recovery company will never need the password for the bitcoin wallet … I recommend that a user NEVER gives their bitcoin passwords to anyone.""

How successful?

Success rates of crypto recovery services vary, although Dave Bitcoin says that a customer’s chances are improved if they have some idea of what their wallet’s password is.

“My overall success rate for recovering funds is about 50% when the user can remember at least some part of the missing information.”

This is an encouraging ratio, although Arkady Bukh notes that many factors can come into play when accessing the chances of success, particularly the length of a password.

“When the client provides only publicly available information, it is impossible to recover anything at all,” he adds. “I would say, every case is different so the percentage of cases situation is not really an applicable concept.”

Good and bad recovery services

However, while there are an increasing number of good recovery services out there, there are also bad or even fraudulent services.

As David Veksler of walletrecovery.info tells Cryptonews.com, ""there are many 'Bitcoin recovery' scams. Almost all of them have two things in common. First, they ask for money upfront. Legitimate services ask for a percentage of recovered funds. Second, they make impossible promises rather than trying to understand your situation and offer realistic advice.""

As an aid to anyone looking for a good legitimate recovery service, Veksler lays down five of the most important traits a reputable service should have:

They have positive customer reviews from a variety of sources. They provide a contract before accepting your case. They try to understand your individual situation and provide realistic feedback about the likelihood of success. They share their plan for how they will recover your coins. They use a secure helpdesk-like service to track your case and securely collect your information. Scammers usually ask for passwords and keys over social media.

The future of recovery

Many of the most well-known recovery services began as one-man outfits, yet Arkady Bukh notes that this is gradually changing.

""Recovery service is becoming more of a business rather than a single person operation,"" he says.

""Indeed, the ideal service consists of IT and data recovery specialist (when we need to restore the wallet file from damaged hard drives, etc), ethical hackers to attempt the passwords, and legal team to protect the interests of all parties and provide court representation, if needed.""

This is a positive development for potential customers. Because as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies become more valuable, the maturation of the most successful services will help customers distinguish fraudulent services from those that actually have a chance of helping them get their crypto back.",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-and-the-latency-arms-race-crypto-exchanges-and-the-hft-crowd,"Max Boonen is founder and CEO of crypto trading firm B2C2. This post is the second in a series of three that looks at high-frequency trading in the context of the evolution of crypto markets (you can see the first here). Opinions expressed within are his own and do not reflect those of CoinDesk.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter for institutional investors focused on crypto assets. You can sign up here.

Carrying on from an earlier post about the evolution of high frequency trading (HFT), how it can harm markets and how crypto exchanges are responding, here we focus on the potential longer-term impact on the crypto ecosystem.

First, though, we need to focus on the state of HFT in a broader context.

Conventional markets are adopting anti-latency arbitrage mechanisms

In conventional markets, latency arbitrage has increased toxicity on lit venues and pushed trading volumes over-the-counter or into dark pools. In Europe, dark liquidity has increased in spite of efforts by regulators to clamp down on it. In some markets, regulation has actually contributed to this. Per the SEC:

“Using the Nasdaq market as a proxy, [Regulation] NMS did not seem to succeed in its mission to increase the display of limit orders in the marketplace. We have seen an increase in dark liquidity, smaller trade sizes, similar trading volumes, and a larger number of “small” venues.”

Why is non-lit execution remaining or becoming more successful in spite of its lower transparency? In its 2014 paper, BlackRock came out in favour of dark pools in the context of best execution requirements. It also lamented message congestion and cautioned against increasing tick sizes, features that advantage latency arbitrageurs. (This echoes the comment to CoinDesk of David Weisberger, CEO of Coinroutes, who explained that the tick sizes typical of the crypto market are small and therefore do not put slower traders at much of a disadvantage.)

Major venues now recognize that the speed race threatens their business model in some markets, as it pushes those “slow” market makers with risk-absorbing capacity to provide liquidity to the likes of BlackRock off-exchange. Eurex has responded by implementing anti-latency arbitrage (ALA) mechanisms in options:

“Right now, a lot of liquidity providers need to invest more into technology in order to protect themselves against other, very fast liquidity providers, than they can invest in their pricing for the end client. The end result of this is a certain imbalance, where we have a few very sophisticated liquidity providers that are very active in the order book and then a lot of liquidity providers that have the ability to provide prices to end clients, but are tending to do so more away from the order book”, commented Jonas Ullmann, Eurex’s head of market functionality. Such views are increasingly supported by academic research.

XTX identifies two categories of ALA mechanisms: policy-based and technology-based. Policy-based ALA refers to a venue simply deciding that latency arbitrageurs are not allowed to trade on it. Alternative venues to exchanges (going under various acronyms such as ECN, ATS or MTF) can allow traders to either take or make, but not engage in both activities. Others can purposefully select – and advertise – their mix of market participants, or allow users to trade in separate “rooms” where undesired firms are excluded. The rise of “alternative microstructures” is mostly evidenced in crypto by the surge in electronic OTC trading, where traders can receive better prices than on exchange.

Technology-based ALA encompasses delays, random or deterministic, added to an exchange’s matching engine to reduce the viability of latency arbitrage strategies. The classic example is a speed bump where new orders are delayed by a few milliseconds, but the cancellation of existing orders is not. This lets market makers place fresh quotes at the new prevailing market price without being run over by latency arbitrageurs.

As a practical example, the London Metal Exchange recently announced an eight-millisecond speed bump on some contracts that are prime candidates for latency arbitrageurs due to their similarity to products trading on the much bigger CME in Chicago.

Why 8 milliseconds? First, microwave transmission between Chicago and the US East Coast is 3 milliseconds faster than fibre optic lines. From there, the $250,000 a month Hibernia Express transatlantic cable helps you get to London another 4 milliseconds faster than cheaper alternatives. Add a millisecond for internal latencies such as not using FPGAs and 8 milliseconds is the difference for a liquidity provider between investing tens of millions in speed technology or being priced out of the market by latency arbitrage.

With this in mind, let’s consider what the future holds for crypto.

Crypto exchanges must not forget their retail roots

We learn from conventional markets that liquidity benefits from a diverse base of market makers with risk-absorption capacity.

Some have claimed that the spread compression witnessed in the bitcoin market since 2017 is due to electronification. Instead, I posit that it is greater risk-absorbing capacity and capital allocation that has improved the liquidity of the bitcoin market, not an increase in speed, as in fact being a fast exchange with colocation such as Gemini has not supported higher volumes. Old-timers will remember Coinsetter, a company that, per the Bitcoin Wiki , “was created in 2012, and operates a bitcoin exchange and ECN. Coinsetter’s CSX trading technology enables millisecond trade execution times and offers one of the fastest API data streams in the industry.” The Wiki page should use the past tense as Coinsetter failed to gain traction, was acquired in 2016 and subsequently closed.

Exchanges that invest in scalability and user experience will thrive (BitMEX comes to mind). Crypto exchanges that favour the fastest traders (by reducing jitter, etc.) will find that winner-takes-all latency strategies do not improve liquidity. Furthermore, they risk antagonising the majority of their users, who are naturally suspicious of platforms that sell preferential treatment.

It is baffling that the head of Russia for Huobi vaunted to CoinDesk that: “The option [of co-location] allows [selected clients] to make trades 70 to 100 times faster than other users”. The article notes that Huobi doesn’t charge – but of course, not everyone can sign up.

Contrast this with one of the most successful exchanges today: Binance. It actively discourages some HFT strategies by tracking metrics such as order-to-trade ratios and temporarily blocking users that breach certain limits. Market experts know that Binance remains extremely relevant to price discovery, irrespective of its focus on a less professional user base.

Other exchanges, take heed.

Coinbase closed its entire Chicago office where 30 engineers had worked on a faster matching engine, an exercise that is rumoured to have cost $50mm. After much internal debate, I bet that the company finally realised that it wouldn’t recoup its investment and that its value derived from having onboarded 20 million users, not from upgrading systems that are already fast and reliable by the standards of crypto.

It is also unsurprising that Kraken’s Steve Hunt, a veteran of low-latency torchbearer Jump Trading, commented to CoinDesk that: “We want all customers regardless of size or scale to have equal access to our marketplace”. Experience speaks.

In a recent article on CoinDesk , Matt Trudeau of ErisX points to the lower reliability of cloud-based services compared to dedicated, co-located and cross-connected gateways. That much is true. Web-based technology puts the emphasis on serving the greatest number of users concurrently, not on serving a subset of users deterministically and at the lowest latency possible. That is the point. Crypto might be the only asset class that is accessible directly to end users with a low number of intermediaries, precisely because of the crypto ethos and how the industry evolved. It is cheaper to buy $500 of bitcoin than it is to buy $500 of Microsoft shares.

Trudeau further remarks that official, paid-for co-location is better than what he pejoratively calls “unsanctioned colocation,” the fact that crypto traders can place their servers in the same cloud providers as the exchanges. The fairness argument is dubious: anyone with $50 can set up an Amazon AWS account and run next to the major crypto exchanges, whereas cheap co-location starts at $1,000 a month in the real world. No wonder “speed technology revenues” are estimated at $1 billion for the major U.S. equity exchanges.

For a crypto exchange, to reside in a financial, non-cloud data centre with state-of-the-art network latencies might ironically impair the likelihood of success. The risk is that such an exchange becomes dominated on the taker side by the handful of players that already own or pay for the fastest communication routes between major financial data centres such as Equinix and the CME in Chicago, where bitcoin futures are traded. This might reduce liquidity on the exchange because a significant proportion of the crypto market’s risk-absorption capacity is coming from crypto-centric funds that do not have the scale to operate low-latency strategies, but might make up the bulk of the liquidity on, say, Binance. Such mom-and-pop liquidity providers might therefore shun an exchange that caters to larger players as a priority.

Exchanges risk losing market share to OTC liquidity providers

While voice trading in crypto has run its course, a major contribution to the market’s increase in liquidity circa 2017-2018 was the risk appetite of the original OTC voice desks such as Cumberland Mining and Circle.

Automation really shines in bringing together risk-absorbing capacity tailored to each client (which is impossible on anonymous exchanges) with seamless electronic execution. In contrast, latency-sensitive venues can see liquidity evaporate in periods of stress, as happened to a well-known and otherwise successful exchange on 26 June which saw its bitcoin order book become $1,000 wide for an extended period of time as liquidity providers turned their systems off. The problem is compounded by the general unavailability of credit on cash exchanges, an issue that the OTC market’s settlement model avoids.

As the crypto market matures, the business model of today’s major cash exchanges will come under pressure. In the past decade, the FX market has shown that retail traders benefit from better liquidity when they trade through different channels than institutional speculators. Systematic internalizers demonstrate the same in equities. This fact of life will apply to crypto. Exchanges have to pick a side: either cater to retail (or retail-driven intermediaries) or court HFTs.

Now that an aggregator like Tagomi runs transaction cost analysis for their clients, it will become plainly obvious to investors with medium-term and long-term horizons (i.e. anyone not looking at the next 2 seconds) that their price impact on exchange is worse than against electronic OTC liquidity providers.

Today, exchange fee structures are awkward because they must charge small users a lot to make up for crypto’s exceptionally high compliance and onboarding costs. Onboarding a single, small value user simply does not make sense unless fees are quite elevated. Exchanges end up over-charging large volume traders such as B2C2’s clients, another incentive to switch to OTC execution.

In the alternative, what if crypto exchanges focus on HFT traders? In my opinion, the CME is a much better venue for institutional takers as fees are much lower and conventional trading firms will already be connected to it. My hypothesis is that most exchanges will not be able to compete with the CME for fast traders (after all, the CBOE itself gave up), and must cater to their retail user base instead.

In a future post, we will explore other microstructures beyond all-to-all exchanges and bilateral OTC trading.

Prospectors blockchain game lands on WAX

In a Sept. 17 blog post, WAX announced that one of the largest dApps in the world, The Prospectors, is launching on the WAX blockchain, on which users buy physical and virtual items using WAX tokens.

This blockchain-based decentralized strategy game set during the 19th-century gold rush launched on EOS in late June 2019. Notably, the game’s designers plan for it to become fully autonomous over time.

Arielle Brechisci, Content Manager at WAX said that the game will launch on the WAX blockchain within the next few weeks, so that WAX Token holders and millions of OPSkins Marketplace customers can start playing the game, adding:

“The exciting game of strategy gives players endless opportunities to earn crypto gold by utilizing blockchain technology, where they can start a business and explore a world teeming with resources there for the taking.”

WAX summoned to California court over 2017 ICO

Cointelegraph reported in August that the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a summons to video game virtual goods company OPSkins Group and WAX in response to a complaint filed by Crypto Asset Fund.

The complaint included 12 charges — including fraud, unlawful business practices and violation of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. In particular, these concerned the accused’s initial coin offering of WAX tokens.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasa-looks-to-hire-data-scientist-with-crypto-and-dlt-background,"NASA is looking to hire a data scientist with crypto and blockchain expertise.

Crypto and blockchain considered a plus

According to a LinkedIn job listing posted on Sept. 20, NASA has a vacancy at its Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, whose primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft and conducting Earth-orbit missions.

Among the high number of required qualifications, NASA listed knowledge in one or more related fields including big data, machine learning, Internet of Things, analytics, statistics and cloud computing. In a separate line, the agency sought experience with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, stating that such qualifications will be considered a plus.

The listed qualifications are supposed to be implemented by the data scientist in designing and implementing a program for analyzing complex, large-scale data sets used for research, modeling, data mining and predictive analysis at NASA, the agency wrote.

NASA on blockchain

The major global aerospace agency is not new to blockchain technology. In January 2019, NASA proposed an air traffic management blockchain framework in order to enable secure, private and anonymous communication with air traffic services.

In April 2018, NASA awarded a grant supporting the development of an autonomous spacecraft that could implement blockchain technology to make decisions without human intervention.",,https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2019/09/ethereum-faucets/,"Faucets have become a fun and unique way for the cryptocurrency industry to disseminate coins over the years. In this article we’re looking at the best Ethereum faucets that’ll help you start earning ETH as soon as possible.

While faucets rarely offer large payouts, they do provide users with a method for obtaining crypto-assets immediately and without having to purchase them through exchanges. Using ether, you’ll be able to both have access to a plethora of decentralized applications on the Ethereum network, as well as to decentralized exchanges.

Ethereum-Faucet

Ethereum-faucet.org allows users to earn ether in exchange for solving captchas or participating in games. The platform has a steep 240-minute timer between claims, but the platform has been one of the more consistent Ethereum faucets, paying out more than $6,000 in free ETH since its inception on over 6 million claims. Users also obtain a lottery ticket every time they make a claim, which can be cashed in for the daily lottery and the potential to win between 0.005 and 0.015 ETH.

Claim Free Coins

ClaimFreeCoins is a multiple cryptoasset platform that allows for users to claim ether. Similar to Etherum-Faucet, the website employs a captcha solving algorithm for obtaining ETH. The timer is set to five minutes between claims, with a referral bonus for users worth 50 percent. Payments can be made directly to a user’s faucethub microwallet.

Speedup Faucet

Speedup-Faucet allows users to start earning ether by solving media like captchas or playing web-based games. The timer is set to 10 minutes between claims, with users able to earn more than 3400 gwei per claim. In addition, the platform allows for the direct depositing of ETH into an ether wallet and provides a modest referral bonus of 10%. Each week, the top 10 claimers are awarded a fixed percentage of the total claims, providing users incentive to stick with the faucet.

Allcoins

Allcoins is another mutl-cryptoasset faucet that allows for users to claim ether. The timer is set to four minutes between claims, with users given the option to solve captchas or other media, play games or directly mine for ETH through a provided web-browser. While browser-based mining is less efficient than traditional crypto mining with proper hardware, it does allow users to adjust their settings to perform in the background while doing other tasks.

FireFaucet

FireFaucet provides an intuitive UI for users to access multiple cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. The faucet has a timer of 30 minutes between claims and users earn ether by completing captchas, solving media or engaging in browser mining. In addition, users can leverage referrals to obtain an additional 20% on payment in this Ethereum faucet.

Approaching Faucets

First and foremost, faucets are not an efficient way to accumulate significant amounts of crypto. Instead, they provide users a method for instantly obtaining tokens without going through the hurdle of signing up and purchasing via exchanges. When choosing a faucet, focus on platforms that provide the best time to payout ratio and always check how the funds are distributed before proceeding.

Various prominent members in the cryptocurrency community have said they started earning their first tokens – often their first bitcoin – using a faucet as the promise of “free money” initially lured them into the space. While faucets do give away free money, it’s hard to actually earn large amounts through them.

Instead, these Ethereum faucets can be used as a way to help enter the Ethereum ecosystem and start experimenting with ERC-20 tokens, decentralized applications, and more.

While it’s already known that 50 percent of the basket will be on the U.S. dollar, the German newspaper Der Spiegel said in a report on Friday that the remaining portion will consist of the euro, the yen, the British pound and the Singapore dollar, with 18 percent, 14 percent, 11 percent, and seven percent, respectively.

The basket will not include the Chinese yuan, the legal tender of the world’s second-largest economy. A report from Reuters suggested excluding the Chinese yuan could help with Libra’s plan in the U.S. given the concerns over the tense trade relationship between the two countries.

The German newspaper said Facebook revealed the percentage breakdown in a letter to Fabio De Masi, a German legislator and former member of the European Parliament.

The newspaper describes him as a “left-wing” politician who believes Libra is a threat to democracy, freedom and financial stability. He is particularly concerned that Libra will not be backed by deposit insurance and that corporate sponsors of the coin may use information harvested from its use, according to Der Spiegel.

Libra, a stablecoin that is designed to anchor to a basket of currencies to facilitate global payments and is governed by a consortium led by Facebook with members including Visa, Uber, and PayPal, has been at the center of controversy since Facebook announced the plan in June.

Lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. have raised concerns over the initiative, while the French finance minister even said the nation plans to block Libra. A board member at the European Central Bank also warned the threat posed by Libra in a recent report. Risks have been cited in addition to concerns about the possible loss of economic sovereignty and control over monetary policy.

China views the currency as a direct threat and is developing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) to meet the challenge posed by Libra, although the structure proposed by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) suggests more a glorified payments system than a true cryptocurrency.

Some members of the Libra Association, as the consortium is known, may exit the group because of the controversy, but most insist that they will stay in.

David Marcus image via House Financial Services Committee",2019-09-23 04:15:28+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-is-finally-launching-its-bitcoin-futures-today-heres-what-to-expect,"Bakkt is finally here.

After two delays and 13 months of questions, the Intercontinental Exchange-backed bitcoin warehouse and futures contract facilitator is launching Monday, opening the door for institutional investors to take positions on the cryptocurrency in a federally regulated venue.

Trading is set to open at midnight UTC and close at 22:00. For the first time, interested observers will be able to see just how much pent-up demand there is among big-money traders for this hotly anticipated service. Bakkt’s data feed will be freely available through June of next year, after which it will require a subscription, according to a company FAQ.

As often noted, Bakkt’s futures will be physically settled, meaning buyers receive bitcoin at expiration, whereas the futures available since 2017 at the Chicago exchange CME Group are cash-settled – essentially side bets on the cryptocurrency’s price.

But what may be most unique about ICE’s bitcoin futures contracts is that they expire after a day. According to the daily contract’s specifications, the bitcoin will be delivered on the second business day after the contract’s date.

For most commodities – frozen concentrated orange juice, cocoa, what have you – the underlying asset is typically not delivered for at least 30 days (although ICE also offers one-day contracts for silver and gold).

While Bakkt is also offering a 30-day bitcoin futures contract, the one-day version will essentially allow institutions to buy or sell bitcoin in a way that’s more familiar to them than the helter-skelter world of crypto exchanges.

As Lanre Sarumi, CEO of crypto derivatives exchange operator LevelTradingField, put it:

“The dailies make their offering like the cash market, but with the ability to short. That’s huge.”

The contract is “well-designed,” Sarumi added. “The basis to the cash market would be very tight. It’ll be interesting to see if it’s the lead or the follower. In theory the cash market should dictate the price of the derivatives [futures] market. In practice, it’s the other way around for a lot of commodities.”

For this reason, Sarumi said he believes the daily contract “will come out of the gate strong.”

Remain calm

That being said, it is unlikely that ICE’s new futures contracts will have a significant near-term impact on the general crypto market, particularly given the company is not looking for retail customers, who make up the bulk of traders still.

Bakkt anticipates significant institutional demand for its futures contract, though it remains to be seen how significant it actually is.

“We could see decent trading volumes for the product,” said John Todaro, director of research at TradeBlock, a provider of institutional trading tools. “I would expect, however, that the demand would be somewhat in line with current cash-settled contracts, such as those offered by the CME.”

Trading volumes for derivatives contracts traditionally outpace trading volumes seen in the underlying spot market, Todaro told CoinDesk.

“As the digital currency space continues to mature we should see an increase in volumes for these products relative to spot over time,” he said.

However, it is unlikely that there will be an immediate surge in demand. Institutional adoption won’t occur with a single catalyst, Todaro said, adding:

“It will take time for these entities to become comfortable with the asset class, identify strategies that are best used to trade the space, understand crypto market liquidity, and also understand the different regulatory and tax obligations across jurisdictions they operate in.”

It is unclear how much bitcoin has been sent to Bakkt since the New York Stock Exchange’s sister company opened its warehouse up for customers to deposit bitcoin on Sept. 6. Each customer must pledge a minimum $3,900 of assets in collateral to purchase a contract. (Speculators must pledge nearly $4,300.)

Bakkt has not disclosed any addresses for its custodian’s wallet or said how much bitcoin has been deposited since the warehouse opened this month. A spokesperson did not answer questions about the matter by deadline.

Broader impact

Caveats aside, ICE launching futures contracts is a significant move for the industry. Todaro noted that “traditional financial institutions are quite conservative.”

“The offering demonstrates that more and more Wall Street institutions are taking a close look at digital currencies and want to gain exposure to this new asset class,” he said.

It is possible that “some of the recent positive market moves across digital currencies have been from traders acting on the Bakkt launch,” Todaro said.

Bakkt’s launch may be a positive sign for other highly anticipated products in the U.S., such as a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Last week. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton expressed concerns with the cryptocurrency market’s maturity.

Derivatives products, like futures contracts, are more tightly regulated than the underlying spot market, and may be more comforting to regulators and potential institutional customers alike.

Todaro concluded:

“This offering, in addition to the CME’s, can help regulators become more comfortable with digital asset trading and market infrastructure.”

Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler image via CoinDesk archives",2019-09-23 01:00:09+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/retailers-around-the-world-that-accept-crypto-from-pizza-to-travel,"Earlier on, when Bitcoin (BTC) arrived on the scene, most cryptocurrency enthusiasts held on to their coins, as there were only so many places they could be spent. Nowadays, the list of marketplaces and retailers accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is significantly larger, providing crypto enthusiasts with more options for making real-world purchases.

After all, with recognizable organizations like Microsoft and Wikipedia now accepting Bitcoin as payment, conversations about Bitcoin and the power of cryptocurrencies are becoming more prominent.

Currently, several fast-food restaurants and coffee shops have started accepting Bitcoin as payment. This will likely provide traction for mass adoption as cryptocurrency payments become increasingly commonplace in day-to-day purchases.

Granted, there are some jurisdictions that do not consider Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency as legal tender. Despite this set back, even big tech companies like Facebook are coming up with payment systems that mimic cryptocurrencies.

Here are some of the leading retailers, merchants and companies that will let you book flights and hotels, buy coffee or pizza, or even go to space with crypto.

Pay for a burger in Germany with crypto

The German branch of fast-food restaurant chain Burger King now claims to accept Bitcoin as payment for its online orders and deliveries, but this is not the first time Burger King has warmed up to Bitcoin as a form of payment.

Related: Bitcoin Not Accepted: Burger King's Crypto Foray Short-Lived

The company, headquartered in Florida in the United States, had its Russian branch announce in 2017 that it would start accepting Bitcoin payments, but it ultimately did not take off. The global fast-food retailer reports an annual revenue of about $20 billion and serves about 11 million customers around the world. If all its outlets move to accept Bitcoin as payment, cryptocurrency adoption would inevitably spread.

Spend crypto at Starbucks and other places

For crypto payments to gain traction, merchants need to implement systems that enable swift and easy cryptocurrency spending. Starbucks is one of the companies taking advantage of this concept through Flexa, a U.S.-based payment startup that is helping the cafe giant, as well as dozens of other companies, accept cryptocurrency payments.

The company developed an app called Spedn that enables crypto holders to make purchases with merchants like Starbucks. The company’s CEO believes that by making cryptocurrencies spendable in the mainstream, commerce will realize the full benefit of blockchain technology all over the world.

Crypto enthusiasts in Silicon Valley’s Palo Alto might already be familiar with Coupa Cafe for other reasons apart from its coffee and food. Through its partnership with a Facebook software developer, Coupa Cafe has been accepting Bitcoin as payment since 2013.

Reports show that the cafe received a steady stream of Bitcoin revenue as soon as they started implementing crypto payments — a clear sign of how eager its customers were to pay in Bitcoin. Coupa Cafe is among the few physical businesses in Palo Alto that accept Bitcoin at the moment. The cafe owners believe that their collaboration with the Facebook software engineer will create more traction in terms of Bitcoin adoption.

Buy food with crypto

With over 50,000 takeaway restaurants listed on its United Kingdom-based site, OrderTakeaways is one of the surest ways to get a pizza paid for with crypto delivered to your doorstep. The company has been accepting Bitcoin payments for online takeout orders since 2018. And other similar services include the Korean platform Shuttledelivery as well as German-based service Lieferando and its subsidiaries in several other countries.

Apart from online orders, crypto can also be spent at a regular Subway restaurants. As early as 2013, several Subway branches started accepting Bitcoin as payment. Now, for a fraction of a Bitcoin, a Subway sandwich can be purchased at select restaurants.

Pay with Bitcoin to tour space

Besides buying food and inexpensive, day-to-day items with crypto, a trip to space can now be bought with Bitcoin. That’s right. Richard Branson’s space tourism company, Virgin Galactic, started accepting Bitcoin as payment as far back as 2013. Although Branson’s predicted date for the first commercial flight has been pushed back several times, the company achieved its first suborbital space flight last year. Perhaps soon, people will be able to tour the moon on crypto’s dime.

Buy jewelry with Bitcoin

A brick-and-mortar American jewelry company called Reeds Jewelers accepts Bitcoin for both its physical and online stores. What’s more, if a purchase is worth more than $25,000, the company provides free armored delivery for safety. Other jewelry companies accepting Bitcoin include Blue Nile Jewelry, Stephen Silver Fine Jewelry and Coaex Jewelry, to name a few.

A big advantage of purchasing large ticket items — like a diamond — with crypto is that it makes moving around large amounts of money cheap and effortless. Reports show that more Silicon Valley investors are buying jewelry with Bitcoin. Last year, Stephen Silver Fine Jewelry reported a 20% growth in crypto transactions, leading to a boost in the company’s sales. The company has been accepting Bitcoin since 2014.

Gyft, a digital platform that allows users to buy, send and redeem gift cards, was one of the first merchants enabling cryptocurrency adoption to gain traction in the real world. The mobile gift card app allows Bitcoin to be used to purchase gift cards from several retailers, some of which include Burger King, Subway, Amazon and Starbucks. The company has also partnered with popular crypto exchange Coinbase to enable users to buy gift cards from their Coinbase wallets.

Travel and pay in Bitcoin

If a traveler only has Bitcoin at their disposal, the following merchants will gladly offer services in exchange for it. TravelbyBit, a flight and hotel booking service, accepts cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Binance Coin and Litecoin (LTC) as payment.

With a network of over 300 crypto-friendly merchants, the platform is one of the biggest supporters of crypto adoption. TravelbyBit can also alert you to upcoming blockchain events in order to interact with other crypto enthusiasts from around the globe. Other platforms to book flights with crypto include Destinia, CheapBizClass, CheapAir, AirBaltic, Bitcoin.Travel and ABitSky, among others.

Use crypto to book a five-star hotel in Zurich

If ever one finds themselves traveling to Zurich Switzerland, either BTC or Ether (ETH) can be used to pay for a stay in a five-star hotel in Zurich. In May 2019, five-star hotel and spa Dodler Grand announced that it will start accepting Bitcoin and Ether as payment.

The hotel has partnered with a fintech firm Inacta as well as Bity (a Swiss-based crypto exchange) to facilitate the payment and conversion of crypto to fiat money. The hotel boasts an amazing view of the Swiss landscape among other enticing amenities that come with a five-star hotel.

Pay for electronics and more with crypto

For all the gadget lovers, there are a bunch of platforms that allow electronic purchases with cryptocurrency. Newegg, for instance, is an electronic retail giant that uses BitPay to process payments made with digital currencies. Even though one cannot get refunds for Bitcoin purchases, Newegg has a good reputation for quality items.

Plus, the company boasts its being among the first merchants to support cryptocurrency adoption. Other platforms for gadget junkies include Eyeboot (a platform that sells crypto mining rigs in exchange for crypto), Microsoft, FastTech and Alza (a U.K.-based online store that sells phones and beauty products).

An ever-expanding list

It seems clear that more retailers are warming up to the idea of accepting cryptocurrencies. There is still a long way to go before full adoption can be achieved, but many companies have nevertheless benefited from being early adopters. Despite the volatile price movements of cryptocurrencies, all evidence points to a future cashless society that uses digital currencies, and crypto is leading the way.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-xlm-miota-eth-trx-xrp,"Bakkt Daily and Monthly Bitcoin Futures will launch on Sept. 22 at 8 p.m. EDT. This is likely to increase volatility in Bitcoin, which has been stuck in a tight range for the past few weeks. Expectations are that Bitcoin-settled contracts and the backing of the New York Stock Exchange will attract institutional players, who have largely stayed away from making big investments in cryptocurrencies. How much of this plays out remains to be seen.

BitMEX CEO and co-founder Arthur Hayes says that 24 hours a day, seven days a week trading in cryptocurrencies will change the way people trade equities, bonds and fiat currencies. He cautioned that traders might “even lose their lunch breaks and weekends as traditional assets absorb some characteristics of digital ones.”

David Marcus, the head of Calibra at Facebook, has said that the company aims to launch Libra in 2020 after addressing regulatory concerns. He denied that Libra will in any way be a threat to sovereign monetary policy. Initially, after the launch, Marcus believes that Libra might face acceptance problems as consumers figure out the best way to use it.

With a major event coming up, how does the chart of the top five performers of the past seven days look? Can they build on the gains or will this rise fizzle out? Let’s find out.

XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) surged in the early part of the week without any specific fundamental news backing the rally. The move propelled it into the list of top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. However, it has not been able to hold on to the gains and has corrected a large part of the intra-week rally. Its overall gains in the past seven days have dropped to only about 18%. After a volatile week, what does the chart project?

The XLM/USD pair had been consistently making new yearly lows in the past five weeks. However, a sharp rally this week propelled the price back above the previous support-turned-resistance of $0.072545. This up move hit a roadblock at the 20-week EMA and the pair has quickly given back the gains. The failure of the bulls to stall the pullback at $0.072545 is a bearish sign.

If the bears sink the cryptocurrency to a new 52-week low, the downtrend will resume. Nevertheless, if the price bounces off current levels and sustains above $0.072545, we expect another attempt by the bulls to breakout of 20-week EMA. If successful, a rally to $0.145 is possible.

IOTA/USD

Iota (MIOTA) announced Chronicle, a permanode solution that will allow its node owners to secure data on the Tangle and maintain uninterrupted access to it. The Iota Foundation has released a platform, called Industry Marketplace, which aims to accelerate industrial automation and commercial machine interaction.

This project has been completed by a collaboration between many firms and the foundation claims it to be the first autonomous and decentralized virtual marketplace in the world. Can this fundamental news start a new uptrend in the cryptocurrency? Let’s analyze the charts.

The IOTA/USD pair held the critical support zone of $0.244553-$0.207622 for the past five weeks. Failure of the bears to break below this range shows buying at lower levels. This week’s rally is facing resistance at the 20-week EMA, which is flattening out. The RSI has turned up and is just below the midpoint, which shows a balance between buyers and sellers.

If the bulls can scale the price above the moving averages, a rally to $0.385033 is possible. A breakout of this stiff resistance will result in a move to $0.5410. Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to push the price above the moving averages, the bears will again try to break below the support zone.

ETH/USD

Due to the congestion in the Ethereum network, an effort is underway to raise the network’s block size. According to a tweet by mining pool Bitfly, tests are in progress to increase the block gas limit to 10 million gas, which will be a total capacity increase of 25%. This is likely to improve network performance and reduce transaction fees.

Cryptocurrency payment services provider BitPay has added support for Ether (ETH). With these positive developments, can the cryptocurrency lead an altcoin recovery? Let’s study its chart.

The recovery in the ETH/USD pair broke above the 20-week EMA but is facing resistance close to $235.70. A breakout of this resistance will carry the price to $320.84. If bulls succeed in breaking out of $320.84, it will complete a bullish cup and handle pattern, which will signal the start of a new uptrend.

However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $235.70, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks. The flattish moving averages and RSI close to 50 levels suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. The cryptocurrency will weaken if bears sink the price below the critical support of $163.755.

TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun has announced a new plan for Tron’s proof-of-stake mechanism, which is expected to increase engagement in the community and ensure a more robust network economic system. Earlier in the week, Justin Sun piggybacked on a tweet by Electronic Arts to market the games available on the Tron blockchain platform. Though Sun never lets any marketing opportunity go by, will it help the cryptocurrency stage a recovery? Let’s look at the chart.

The bears could not capitalize on the break below $0.016 in the past two weeks, which shows a lack of sellers at lower levels. This week, buying by aggressive bulls has pushed the price back above $0.016 but is facing some resistance close to $0.01774. If the price sustains above $0.01774, a move to the 20-week EMA is likely. A breakout of the moving averages can propel the price to the top of the range at $0.0409111 in the medium-term.

The traders can initiate long positions above $0.019 and keep a stop loss of $0.0135. If the pair struggles to break out of the moving averages, we will trail the stops higher to reduce risk. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from current levels and plummets below $0.0139038.

XRP/USD

Ripple has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that claims it violated US securities laws by selling unregistered securities. However, some believe that the motion put forth other arguments for dismissal of the plaintiff's claims and failed to address whether XRP is an unregistered security or not. This has not affected its price as it still managed to find a place among the top-five performers in the past seven days.

The XRP/USD pair held the support at $0.24508 for the past three weeks, which shows that lower levels are attracting buyers. During the week, the bulls pushed the price above the support turned resistance of $0.27795 but hit a wall close to the 20-week EMA. If the bulls can keep the price above $0.27795, we expect another attempt to breakout of the moving averages. If successful, the pair can rally to $0.50640.

However, if the bulls fail to stall the correction above $0.27795, it will indicate that buying dries up at higher levels. We then expect bears to again attempt to sink the price below the support of $0.24508. A breakdown to new yearly lows will be a huge negative as it is likely to result in panic selling.

We’ve been warned for years that a quantum computing breakthrough is just around the corner. When that day comes, we’re told, it could render existing encryption standards obsolete, threatening the security of every major blockchain. It seems that day has finally arrived, with Google achieving “quantum supremacy.” Impressive as the feat is, however, it doesn’t signal game over for crypto networks – and least not yet.

They Actually Did It, the Absolute Madmen

On Friday, the FT published a story claiming that a paper published by Google researchers described a major computing breakthrough. Using a quantum computer, the team managed to perform a calculation in just over three minutes that would take the world’s most powerful supercomputer 10,000 years. In an industry that’s characterized by incremental improvements, that sounds like a leap that warrants comparisons with the Big Bang. Quantum supremacy, which the researchers claim to have attained, refers to the moment when a quantum computer outperforms the world’s best classical computer in a specific test.

Google described the achievement as a “milestone towards full-scale quantum computing,” and predicted quantum computing capacity to expand at a “double exponential rate,” outstripping the exponential rate that Moore’s Law has described so faithfully for decades. On the face of it, this technology sounds in danger of destroying everything we hold dear, starting with Bitcoin. The reality, as is so often the case, is more nuanced: predictions of Bitcoin’s death at the hands of quantum computing have been greatly exaggerated.

Cryptography and the Rise of Quantum-Resistant Blockchains

Fearing that a quantum breakthrough is just around the corner, threatening the sanctity of all known encryption algorithms, cryptographers have been striving to develop quantum-resistant blockchains that can withstand a Cambrian explosion in quantum computers.

Johann Polecsak, CTO of quantum-resistant blockchain QAN, told news.Bitcoin.com: “The most popular public-key algorithms are theoretically at risk of being broken by a quantum computing breakthrough. Most encrypted data intercepted and stored today could be decrypted by quantum computers in the near future.” On Google’s quantum computer, believed to be called Sycamore, Polecsak ventured: “The notion of Google achieving a quantum breakthrough sounds very dramatic, but in reality, it’s hard to gauge the significance at this time. How can we be sure that Google’s quantum computer is more powerful than D-wave’s, for example, which surpassed 1,000 qubits four years ago?”



All signatures and hashes within QAN’s protocol that might be susceptible to quantum algorithms (typically Shor or Grover algorithm searches) are protected by post-quantum cryptography. Just as it sounds, this is a school of cryptography dedicated to protecting networks in a world of quantum supercomputers. There are numerous models of post-quantum cryptography, with QAN favoring a lattice-based approach; other variants of the six primary schools of post-quantum cryptographic research include hash- and code-based cryptography.

Andrew Yang Suggests the Threat Is Real

One of the hardest things when discussing quantum computing is separating fact from fiction, fears from fear-mongering, and theory from practice. It is a sector of computing in which FUD and FOMO are in constant supply – which might explain why the quantum threat has resonated so strongly within the cryptosphere. Just how “justed” Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in the event of a quantum breakthrough depends on who you want to believe. For example, pro-tech presidential candidate Andrew Yang explains in his policy on quantum computing and encryption standards:

Quantum computers, using qubits, will theoretically be able to perform the calculations necessary to break our current encryptions standards in under a day. When that happens, all of our encrypted data will be vulnerable. That means our businesses, communications channels, and banking and national security systems may be accessible.

As for when this will happen, Yang notes that “Some estimates put the timeline for this at a decade or less. In short, this is a problem that has to be fixed now … First, and immediately, we need to invest in and develop new encryption standards and systems, and immediately shift to using these quantum computing-resistant standards to protect our most sensitive data.”

Bitcoin Isn’t Broken Yet

While advancements in quantum computing warrant close scrutiny, there is no evidence to suggest that BTC and BCH private keys are in danger of getting popped any time soon. To illustrate just how secure current cryptographic standards are, Openbazaar’s Chris Pacia wrote a blog post in 2013 in which he discussed the commonly used 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), concluding: “If every one of the 7 billion people on Earth had 10 computers testing 1 billion key combinations per second, it would take the entire population 77,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to find a single 128-bit AES key.”

As for how quickly a quantum computer could achieve the same feat, Pacia confesses to being no expert, but ventures: “Quantum computing would likely double the size of a key that could be effectively brute-forced. That might cause AES-128 to fall, but AES-192 and AES-256 should still be safe.”

Bitcoin mining uses SHA-256, while ECDSA (Elliptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is used in the cryptography to create private and public key pairs. In the event of quantum computers cracking SHA-256, for example, an obvious solution would be to switch to a stronger encryption algorithm of the same family, such as SHA-512. As Wikipedia’s post-quantum cryptography entry notes, “While the quantum Grover’s algorithm does speed up attacks against symmetric ciphers, doubling the key size can effectively block these attacks. Thus post-quantum symmetric cryptography does not need to differ significantly from current symmetric cryptography.” In other words, even if quantum computing does materialize at scale, it’s unlikely to require redesigning our cryptography from the ground up; rather, we’ll just need to enforce more robust versions of existing algorithms that incorporate more bits.

As Sabine Hossenfelder concluded in a video on quantum supremacy in June, “I’m not very optimistic that quantum computers will have practical applications any time soon. I’m quite worried that quantum computing will go the same way as nuclear fusion: that it will remain forever promising but never quite work. Nevertheless, quantum supremacy is going to be a super exciting event.”

However, the majority of crypto exchanges are still faking nearly all of their trading volumes.

Wash trading is a form of market manipulation which artificially inflates the activity on a crypto asset, thereby attracting investors who are seduced by the resultant FOMO (fear of missing out).

The practice is technically forbidden and was banned in the United States under the 1936 Commodities Exchange Act.

The latest market surveillance report from the Blockchain Transparency Institute suggests that overall wash trading has declined, however, it is still prevalent on a number of top crypto exchanges.

The findings revealed that global wash trading has reduced by 35.7% among the top 40 exchanges since the beginning of 2019.

At the same time, however, the report found that among the top 100 exchanges on CoinMarketCap, there are 73 currently which are wash trading over 90% of their volumes.

The BTI has also launched a live tracking page to show which cryptocurrencies and exchanges are currently wash trading the most.

Of the top crypto assets, privacy coins were found to be wash traded the most, with Monero and Dash getting over 90% each.

Other top manipulated assets included Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, BSV and Huobi Token, each with more than 80%.

Crypto exchanges getting clean

Although the report details deceptive practices on many crypto exchanges, there is some good news to be found.

The report stated that Kraken, Poloniex, Coinbase, and Upbit were found to be “cleaner” than before, reducing the amount of wash trading on their respective platforms.

On the flip side, the worst two exchanges for wash trading were OKEx and Bibox, with fake volumes reportedly exceeding 75%.

Geographically the cleanest exchanges were found in the US and Japan primarily due to stricter regulatory standards.

South Korea, which also has stringent regulations, was found to have a higher instance of wash trading for privacy tokens XMR and Dash as noted above.

There have been moves to delist these high anonymity crypto assets from South Korean exchanges in recent weeks, however.

The BTI has now created a list of verified exchanges that it claims are reducing the practice of wash trading.

The latest added to this list of good guys include Binance, Gemini, Bitflyer, and Indodax.

The world’s top exchange, Binance, has dropped below 10% after hovering around 20% for the first few months of 2019.

Japanese exchange BitFlyer is now below 5% and Gemini has also fallen under 10%.

The BTI verified program uses a machine learning wash trade algorithm to analyze 26 different data points before determining a wash trade.

To qualify exchanges must have less than 10% wash trading over a 30-day period.

CoinMarketCap bad for business

BTI singled out CoinMarketCap as one of the industry’s bad players for continuing to list a number of scam exchanges.

“CMC still lists numerous scam exchanges in its Top-10 ‘Adjusted Volume’ rankings,” the report said.

“Its Top-10 list includes LBank, BW.com, Bit-Z, Coinbene, and OEX, for which our data shows wash trading rates at high levels from 96.9% up to 99.7%.”

It added that CoinMarketCap does not verify volume figures and encourages exchanges to report higher volumes to increase their visibility.

The overall situation has improved in 2019 but there are still a number of culprits for excessive wash trading so reports like these are a good reference in determining which ones to avoid.",2019-09-22 18:10:20+00:00,https://coinrivet.com/the-marshall-islands-sov-cryptocurrency/,"The Marshall Islands shocked the world in 2018 when it announced its intention to create a new cryptocurrency – Sovereign Coin (SOV) – which would be used as its legal tender.

However, creating a cryptocurrency as a legal tender is a difficult process with no precedent. And it raises a lot of questions. The remote Pacific country spread out over more than 1,000 islands has had to engage in lengthy discussions with various stakeholders from the US Treasury to the United Nations.

Coin Rivet spoke to blockchain strategist and SOV adviser Steve Tendon to find out more about what makes the Marshall Islands’ cryptocurrency so unique.

As a key member of Malta’s Blockchain Task Force, Tendon’s company Chain Strategies has been instrumental in promoting the growth and expansion of the “Blockchain Island”. Now, he’s eyeing the real possibility of creating a cryptocurrency as a legal tender for the first time.

The Sovereign #SOV is FAIR with SEIGNIORAGE assigned to important policy goals (climate change) or DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY to holders & MARSHALLESE CITIZENS. A new form of **democratic distribution of wealth**. Want to know more? On #malta? here:https://t.co/TvQADbuPrx — TΞNÐ0N (@T3ND0N) September 18, 2019

Why create the SOV cryptocurrency in the first place?

The Marshall Islands is extraordinary in many more ways than just its geography. About halfway between Hawaii and Australia, the islands rest on top of submerged volcanoes and have an average elevation of just two metres above sea level. Much of the 1,156 islands are uninhabitable for various reasons, from lack of rain to nuclear contamination.

Tendon explains: “The Marshall Islands have not only been subject to enormous bomb testing in the past with Bikini Island, but it is also one of the very first countries that will suffer enormously because of climate change and rising sea levels. Moreover, the acidification of the seas will literally erode the base of these islands that are made of coral.”

A rising global temperature affects both the ecology and fisheries as well as one of the Islands’ largest industries, which is coconuts.

“These are easily affected by lack of water,” he says, “and finally rising ocean levels are a huge problem. The average elevation is only two metres above sea level. So on a normal day with bad weather, most of these islands are underwater.”

Added to this list of growing pressures is the fact that in 2023, funding from the US will come to an end. This creates a huge additional strain on the Pacific nation. Tendon stresses:

“The country is at serious risk of disappearing like Atlantis, covered over by the sea. The ambition behind the SOV cryptocurrency is to create a digital infrastructure so that if this catastrophic scenario where a country disappears happens, the citizens will still have their digital legacy and information safeguarded on a blockchain. I stress this point ‘safeguarded on a blockchain’, because the SOV is a cryptocurrency that will exist on a blockchain, not a central bank digital currency in a server farm on land.”

I wanna tattoo this number to my forehead: Marshall Islands as a nation actually contributes 0.00001% of the world’s global emissions. And yet we are the ones set to disappear first #adaptourworld #1point5 #wearenotdrowningwearefighting https://t.co/V1r2qAdHnq — Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner (@kathykijiner) September 10, 2019

Preserving RMI citizens’ digital identities

“One driver here which we must not forget is connected to resilience and sustainability,” Tendon explains. The Marshall Islands has never had its own legal tender but makes use of the US dollar. Yet, as a recognised country by the United Nations, it has the right to create its own legal tender.

But while the Marshall Islands could follow the examples of every nation that’s gone before it and print its own money, it chooses an option that gives its citizens a sustainable solution to their pressing challenges.

“A central bank digital currency will still reside on a central bank’s infrastructure,” says Tendon. “So materially it will be in some server farm, but still on land, so to say. The resilience and sustainability issue that the Marshall Islands wants to address is that, if their land disappears, they still want to be Marshallese and have their digital information preserved. They still want to function as a country even though many may be forced to migrate to other shores.”

Rolled out in a timed release

At the recent Invest: Asia cryptocurrency conference, the Marshall Islands announced that the SOV cryptocurrency would be rolled out slowly in a Timed-Release Monetary Issuance (TRMI). Since many of the finer details of the SOV are still being worked on by economists, technologists, and mathematicians, it won’t be the SOV that people are buying, but units that will later be exchanged for it.

The non-profit SOV Development Foundation is the institution helping the government research and test this idea through a ""TRMI"" or Time Release Monetary Issuance. In cryptoworld, this could also be seen as a Pre-sale. It tests the security, exchange liquidity and market interest — Blockchain Center of Excellence (@UAWalton_BCOE) September 12, 2019

But if the isolated country is facing so many pressing issues now, why choose to roll out its legal tender over such an extended period with no concrete release date set?

Well, because it’s a complicated situation.

“We are not just dealing with a cryptocurrency,” Tendon explains. “We are not dealing with a token, even if those are elements and aspects of what’s happening. We’re dealing with a legal tender, so real money for a real country…

“Of course, there is a huge concern that rapid adoption driven by speculative investors as we’ve seen in the ICO space could provide some serious monetary instability. So this timed release is a way to make the start uptake of the currency somewhat controlled and dampened in time, rather than one offering where everyone is rushing for it.”

The TRMI will take place over a period of 18 months before being converted 1:1 into the actual SOV cryptocurrency. The idea is to keep the speculators out and to ensure that only long-term investors come on board.

What about the infrastructure necessary for the SOV cryptocurrency to work?

Taking into account the widely dispersed population and logistical issues the country faces, does the country have the necessary infrastructure for its citizens to transact in digital currency? Actually, thanks to satellite coverage and telecoms, Tendon explains that “it’s actually much easier to deploy than, say, setting up a central bank, printing money, and shipping boxes of paper around”. This would be far costlier than making use of technology, he says, adding:

“Up to this date, the Marshall Islands has not had its own currency. It has been using the US dollar. They now have the opportunity to do it with cryptocurrency and all the benefits of technology… it is a unique situation. They have their right to have their own money, to print their own money, and they choose to do it through the best of both worlds with elements of crypto. It’s a very fortunate combination of circumstances that makes this possible.”

The Marshall Islands is its own state and not part of an association such as the EU. This gives it the freedom to create the SOV cryptocurrency.

“In Malta, such conversations were happening,” Tendon says, “but materially it would never have been possible. Malta is part of the EU. We all know what happened when Estonia tried to promote Estcoin – it was not allowed.”

The implications of a currency with legal tender status

We’ve seen other countries come out with their own cryptocurrencies already, such as Venezuela’s Petro and Iran’s PayMon. However, Tendon stresses that SOV is an entirely different animal. First of all, it is more than a cryptocurrency, and it “is not a device to circumvent US sanctions”. It will have legal tender status. This has a couple of huge and very different consequences.

“Legal tender means that within the Marshallese economy, this currency must be used. So, if I issue an invoice in SOV, there is an obligation to pay it in SOV. Likewise, taxes and social benefits will be made in SOV, so the purpose is very different.” He continues:

“Also as legal tender in the United Nations, it is very possible that it would be exchanged on the Forex exchange markets. That is very different from other cryptocurrencies. The intent is to keep out the speculators and to tie the usage of the SOV to the real economy; not just the local Marshall Islands, but also a means of payment for e-commerce. The overall intent is to expand the reach of the SOV beyond the physical shores of the islands and promote its usage in all sorts of electronic transactions.”

How will the SOV actually work?

If you’re interested in finding out more about the SOV, it’s definitely worth giving the white paper a read, even though much of the factors are still TBD against a ticking clock. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, SOV will have KYC, AML, CFT, sanction list filtering, and identity built into its technology – all the while providing very strong guarantees for privacy. This will help the Marshall Islands with its compliance burden in the international fight against money laundering.

The Marshall Islands Will Proceed with SOV Cryptocurrency pic.twitter.com/izwbuainv5 — Leonid Kotlyar (@LeonidKotlyar) September 12, 2019

Moreover, unlike a central bank digital currency, the monetary policy of the SOV “will not be established by the whim of some central banker who wakes up some morning and decides that a new round of quantitative easing is necessary. The monetary policy of the SOV cryptocurrency is hard-coded on-chain. So it is established algorithmically with a 4% inflation rate per year.”

The economists behind the SOV are further striving to implement Nobel prize winner Milton Friedman’s so-called K-per cent rule.

Tendon explains: “It’s like a monetary policy that has been envisioned in theory but no country has been able or willing to put it into practice, and here we will do it on-chain. So the monetary policy becomes like the Constitution that cannot be changed.”

The socio-economic impact of SOV

There are also the social dimensions of the SOV. Tendon states: “This is this idea that when the SOV is mined or minted (we don’t know what term to use yet because it is both a cryptocurrency and a conventional currency), but basically when it is created, the SOV will also directly benefit the SOV holders, and in particular the resident citizens of the Marshall Islands…

“So unlike a central bank that creates money out of nothing by printing it and that money goes into the vaults of the central bank, in the issuance of the SOV, there will be a part of it that goes directly into the pockets of the citizens, pioneering new ways to fairly distribute wealth at the moment it is created in the economic system. This will have enormous social, economic, and political consequences.”

As per the white paper, a percentage of the issuance of the SOV cryptocurrency will be designated to predetermined funds in a bid to help the RMI deal with the unfortunate multiple environmental disasters it faces.

One of these funds is the Marshall Islands Green Climate Fund to help prepare for and mitigate the impact of the effects of climate change, as well as to increase sustainability in the Marshall Islands. The other is the Marshall Islands Nuclear Legacy and Health Care Fund to help those affected by nuclear testing.

No other country has ever done anything like this before. This makes the SOV so much more than a national legal tender or cryptocurrency designed for speculative intent. Woven into its very fabric is a pressing social need to address the very real problems the Marshall Islands faces.

How is the value of the SOV determined?

The SOV may unite the “best of both worlds” as Tendon says, and it may be entirely different from the national cryptocurrencies we’ve seen before like the Petro or PayMon. But these cryptocurrencies have been supposedly backed by oil or gold. How is the SOV’s value going to be determined and what will it be backed by, if anything?

Tendon stresses that the ideas for this are still “very much on the drawing board”. However, the plan is that the SOV’s value is determined through market mechanisms.

The idea is that the SOV reflects the value of the real economy (physical or electronic) that will adopt it, just like any other national currency, only that its adoption could be much larger than the boundaries of the Islands.

He concludes: “Connecting all the dots, the SOV is a cryptocurrency on a blockchain which will eventually lead to a pervasive infrastructure that will allow the country to become more resilient with respect to these environmental issues. And if in all this the SOV is adopted for e-commerce and transactions beyond the shores of the Marshall Islands, that would give it more power.”

What is the timeline for the SOV?

When asked when we can expect the country to start the roll-out of the TRMI and the SOV, Tendon laughs and says that “no one has a crystal ball”. However, he does concede that recent events in the crypto space have accelerated the work that is being done.

He is referring to various significant efforts to launch a global cryptocurrency by Facebook, Binance, China, and even the central bank of England announcing tentative plans for a Synthetic Hegemonic Currency.

“The trend is clear. There are many capable forces in the market that are waking up to this idea that a global currency has several points of interest – and there are many stakeholders that would like it to happen. To tie this back to the SOV, it could easily become that kind of global currency.”",2019-09-22 10:00:36+00:00,https://micky.com.au/peter-brandts-bitcoin-prediction-gets-spanked-by-millennials/,"With 45 years of experience, Peter Brandt has an enviable track record on predictions. But that didn’t save him from the Crypto Twitter hordes.

Peter Brandt has a long track record since 1980 of using classical charting principles to make calls on market movements – which he likes to think of as “possibilities” rather than flat out “predictions”.

Brandt famously called the early 2018 crypto market crash and the long bear market that followed.

In May, Brandt suggested Bitcoin was about to see a “parabolic move” at a time when Bitcoin was just over $6100.

The price more than doubled by mid-July, though it’s pulled back since.

Brandt’s short and long calls at odds

In early September he suggested the possibility that Bitcoin was in its “fourth parabolic phase” and projected the possibility of a $140,000 price during the next bull run.

But he followed that up less than a week later by cautioning it could be a bumpy ride skywards.

He identified a bearish descending triangle pattern that he says “implies but does not demand” a lower price in the short term.

Despite identifying the pattern, he seemed uncertain about how it would play out.

He explained he was bullish in the long term and has a “sizeable position” on BTC going up.

“I am long BTC as a position trader. Yet, as a swing trader, I must respect classical charting principles…

There have been numerous occasions over the years when prices blew out of the upside of a descending triangle. When this happens it is referred to as a descending triangle failure.”

BTC will do the opposite of what you expect

On the weekend he tweeted:

“One thing I have learned from 45 years of trading:

Markets have a tendency to do what the most number of market participants least expect and don’t want to happen.

Descending triangles are most often bearish.”

Crypto Twitter responds rudely

Various inhabitants of Crypto Twitter got up in arms about the tweet informing Brandt that a) EVERYBODY was expecting a BTC price drop due to TA, and b) that he doesn’t know anything anyway.

Tommi Karjalainen tweeted, “99% of crypto is expecting that BTC will drop hard soon. Either this is the easiest short ever or BTC does the opposite and moons.”

CryptøManiac101: “Most are actually bearish on #Bitcoin and this post proves just that!”

Dennis: “I agree, when this guy starts posting his BS, go the other way.”

John Bitcoin seemed to think four decades of experience was irrelevant: “Your 45 years doesn’t matter. This isn’t the stock market and that is why we are here.”

Aryan’s used a circuitous logic approach to conclude: “Most commenters under this tweet are saying that most people are bearish so this should be bullish. Which would mean it is bearish.”

Brandt’s riposte

Brandt took the slings and arrows of Crypto Twitter with humour, sarcastically tweeting in response:

“Thanks to all of you who corrected me on this Tweet. How stupid of me to think that the majority of BTC traders were expecting higher prices, when in fact they expect prices to go down. Once again I took a millennial spanking.”

Unfortunately, as the crypto market has boomed, so has fraud.

Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin have been stolen or lost and, due to the nature of the asset, it’s almost impossible to trace where they’ve gone. At the same time, it’s not got any easier to make transactions using cryptocurrency. Fees are still relatively high and can take days to transact.

5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit! According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air… And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential...

So while Bitcoin might have gained mainstream attention, owning the asset is just as difficult and risky as ever. With this being the case, if you do want exposure to the asset, I would recommend buying a stock with exposure to Bitcoins instead.

Bitcoin stocks

There are three primary ways I’d play the Bitcoin price right now. Firstly, Nvidia is one of the world’s largest chipmakers and has carved out a specific niche in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market.

GPUs, which are more powerful than the traditional central processing units (CPU), are popular with miners. The company has seen a significant spike in demand for its products over the past few years as miners have rushed to take advantage of the Bitcoin price.

My second option is US market provider CME Group. This exchanged was the first significant exchange to launch Bitcoin futures and is planning to expand its offering later this year due to booming demand.

Thirdly, there’s London-listed CFD provider Plus500. This company registered a spike in profitability in 2017 and 2018 as traders rushed to try and bet on the Bitcoin price. It has since seen profits come under pressure due to a regulatory crackdown, but a price recovery could send profits skyrocketing again.

A sector play

I think the three options are a great way to play the Bitcoin price although, from a longer-term perspective, I think it would make more sense to invest in the tech sector in general, rather than limit your options to just cryptocurrency. The world is in the midst of a tech revolution, and this is almost certain to continue. However, picking tech stocks can be tricky, and I think it is best left to the experts.

There’s a whole selection of tech-focused investment trusts and funds out there you can buy to profit not just from Bitcoin, but from cloud computing, hardware and artificial intelligence.

The Scottish Mortgage Trust is a great example. Over the past five years, this investment trust has returned 136%, outperforming its benchmark by 52% by betting on some of the markets hottest tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Polar Capital Technology Trust has returned 182% over the same time frame. The one downside of this investment trust is that it is quite expensive with an ongoing charges figure of 1%.

A cheaper alternative is the Allianz Technology Trust. This investment trust has a fairly similar investment portfolio to Polar, but its main difference is the fact that it charges just 0.48% per year. It has also outperformed its peer over the past five years, returning to 106% since the end of 2014.

Considering the track record of these managers, I’d rather invest my money with them over Bitcoin any day.",2019-09-22

The leading digital currency Bitcoin is down 1.55% on the day to trade at about $9,813 at publishing time. During the day, BTC has been trading in a narrow corridor between $9,788 and $10,097 — the lowest and highest price points of the coin over the day.

As Cointelegraph reported in a dedicated analysis earlier on Monday, if Bakkt momentum picks up, Bitcoin prices could see resistance about $10,630 on the day. On the other hand, support on the weekly Bollinger Bands sits about $7,700. If this level is broken, the price needs to hold $7,150 before the monthly moving average is breached.

Ether (ETH), the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is slightly down by 0.2% over the day, trading at $207.07 at publishing time. The major altcoin saw its highest price point over the week on Sept. 19, reaching $223.70, with a weekly low of $191 on Sept. 16.

Conversely, XRP is in the green today, having gained 2.68% to trade at around $0.280 at publishing time. The third-largest coin traded at about $0.258 on Sept. 16, which was XRP’s lowest price point on its weekly chart, while the high was $0.323 on Sept. 18.

On the top 20 cryptocurrencies list, Chainlink (LINK), Tezos (XTZ) and IOTA (MIOTA) are major gainers, up 3%, 4.22% and 4% respectively. Major losers are Stellar (XLM) and Monero (XMR), which are down by more than 3%, while Algorand (ALGO) has lost 5.93% on the day.

Also on Monday, Binance officially announced the listing of XTZ, launching three new trading pairs featuring BTC, top stablecoin Tether (USDT) and Binance’s native token Binance Coin (BNB).

The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is at $265 billion at publishing time, up from a weekly low of $259 billion earlier on Monday.

Many view the launch, which has been delayed for nearly nine months, as a crucial step toward mainstream adoption of digital assets.

The futures of Bitcoin: Futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell a given commodity at a specific price at a specific time in the future. Bitcoin futures trading, which in the US is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), may be more attractive to traditional financial institutions than investing directly in the asset. Investors can use futures to bet that the price will fall, an approach that can be used as a hedge.

ICE’s competitor the CME Group has been offering Bitcoin futures contracts since December 2017. According to the Wall Street Journal, more than $200 million worth of Bitcoin futures already change hands on an average day.

How Bakkt is unique: The new contracts will be the first to be “physically settled”—that is, when a contract expires, the bet will be settled with actual Bitcoin. In contrast, the CME Group’s contracts are settled in cash; the traders never actually deal with the digital currency.

Crucial to Bakkt’s setup is its Bitcoin “warehouse,” which stores customers’ digital coins. In fact, the launch’s delay was in large part due to a drawn-out discussion between ICE and the CFTC about how best to do this. Crypto-assets pose unique challenges because ownership is tied to cryptographic keys, and transactions are irreversible.

Why it matters: When ICE revealed its plans for Bakkt in August of 2018, it announced partnerships with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, and promised “an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store, and spend digital assets on a seamless global network.” And it stressed that the platform would be regulated and transparent.

Bakkt wants to make mainstream institutions less skeptical of digital assets. And it is betting that this will open the door to a much larger future marketplace for them—one that serves consumers in addition to financial institutions. To that end, getting the CFTC’s blessing for its custody service is just as important as the new futures contracts.

A bitter trade war is seeing the United States and China slap ever-increasing tariffs on goods on a tit-for-tat basis. Over in the United Kingdom, never-ending uncertainty shrouds Brexit, with politicians in Westminster and Brussels at an impasse over the country’s imminent departure from the European Union.

A shock election result in Argentina caused the peso to crash, while hyperinflation in Zimbabwe and Venezuela means everyday essentials are dramatically rising in price on a daily basis. On top of all that, protests continue in Hong Kong amid concerns about interference from the Chinese mainland.

And this is just a snapshot of what’s happening in the global economy at the moment. It’s little wonder that fears of a recession are growing. The services sector represents 80% of gross domestic product in the U.K., and at the start of September, a closely watched survey suggested growth had slowed to a crawl in July. Given that Britain’s economy contracted in the second quarter, another three months of decline would officially signal that a downturn has begun. Stateside, investors were spooked by an inverted yield curve, where short-term Treasury bonds yield more than long-term bonds. This indicator has successfully predicted every U.S. recession for almost 60 years.

Here’s the question: With the global economy in such disarray, is there an opportunity for cryptocurrencies and blockchain to save the day? In this article, we’re going to look at the chances and challenges facing the industry right now — as well as how this technology is already making an impact.

Crypto and blockchain: The chances

First, let’s take a look at the positives for crypto and blockchain — for, after years in the wilderness, some central banks are beginning to explore how the sector can enhance their economies. Back in August, the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled plans to release a real-time payments and settlements service that would enable funds to be transferred quickly and around the clock, including weekends. Ripple Labs was also elected to the central bank’s Faster Payments Task Force Steering Committee — a milestone that shows financial institutions are in listening mode.

There have also been positive murmurings from organizations that have, until now, been skeptical about crypto’s potential. The European Central Bank (ECB) has barely hidden its cynicism about the industry in the past, maintaining that Bitcoin (BTC) is not a real currency and crypto doesn’t factor into the real economy. But in a sign that a changing of the guard could result in softening attitudes, the nominee to be the next ECB president — Christine Lagarde, the current head of the International Monetary Fund — has said central banks should be open to cryptocurrencies and the wider social benefits they could bring.

Elsewhere, there is increasing evidence that BTC has been relied on as a safe haven during times of economic turmoil. Financial analysts have maintained that retail investors are relying on the dominant cryptocurrency as a hedge against the turbulence caused by the U.S.-China trade war — prompting some to describe Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Telling evidence of this came in the middle of August, as BTC prices tumbled by more than 7% when tensions between the two economic superpowers appeared to ease.

This sentiment has also been spreading from retailers to everyday consumers. The political uncertainty in Hong Kong has seen some protesters turn to cryptocurrency so they don’t leave a trail of payments for the government to investigate. A spike in demand there led to locals paying a premium of about $300 per Bitcoin when compared with exchanges elsewhere. Premiums of $420 were seen when Mauricio Macri suffered a shocking defeat in Argentina’s presidential elections. And in Venezuela, records for Bitcoin trading volumes are continuously being broken because of its weakening national currency.

Crypto and blockchain: The challenges

As with most things in life, there are always two sides to the story. Focusing on the positives for crypto and blockchain would be neglecting some very real and pressing challenges facing the industry — challenges that extend beyond scalability and security. It has been well-documented that many blockchain networks struggle to compete with the capacity of traditional financial giants, and it is undeniable that repeated hacks have dented consumer confidence and stymied mainstream adoption. Although it is incumbent on the industry to find solutions to these very real problems, there are other issues that lie firmly out of their control.

Critics argue that fragmentation — the current existence of thousands of competing cryptocurrencies and countless blockchains — means the industry struggles to work in unison and speak with a single voice. This has been coupled with a disjointed approach to regulation, with nations around the world taking contradictory stances on crypto’s legality, meaning startups are free to operate in some jurisdictions but banned in others. Whereas a new coin might be welcomed with open arms in Japan, the simple act of owning crypto in India could potentially result in jail time.

Mainstream companies are also wading into the world of crypto. While this can be regarded as an opportunity to build public awareness, this brings its own threats. Since Facebook unveiled its white paper for Libra back in June, the reaction from many U.S. politicians has been one of alarm. While some fear a stablecoin spearheaded by a tech giant could undermine the dollar and wreck the global economy, others have gone further — claiming it could be more of a danger to America than the 9/11 attacks. Back in the crypto world, there are also fears that Libra could undermine BTC and altcoins, ultimately undermining the censorship-free, decentralized world that Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned — a world where the value of an asset wasn’t tied to the fate of the U.S. dollar.

Forging a path for the future

These are just some of the chances and challenges that need to be explored and debated if cryptocurrency and blockchain are going to continue gaining traction in the global economy.

The CFC St. Moritz says its conference is designed to offer exactly this: a place where the brightest minds can come together to discuss and forge a way forward. Strictly by invitation only, the event aims to pave the way for the valuable transfer of knowledge between participants — enabling private and institutional investors, as well as family offices and funds, to meet leading experts in the crypto and blockchain universe and discuss the topics mentioned above. Ultimately, the vision is to transfer knowledge by personal interactions between experts and investors, and allow every participant to build a “real” network — creating unforgettable memories, priceless contacts and the space to pursue new opportunities.

Just 200 to 250 people are going to be invited to the next conference, which is set to take place from Jan. 15–17, 2020 at Suvretta House St. Moritz in Switzerland.",,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-startup-sues-toronto-exchange-group-for-500-million-over-soured-deal,"Canadian startup Paycase Global Corp. is suing TMX Group, for breach of contract after the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange terminated their deal to create cryptocurrency-related products and services.

Paycase is claiming loss of revenue, loss of opportunity and loss of reputation and is demanding $500 million for damages and that TMX resumes its performance, according to a lawsuit filed Monday in Canada’s Superior Court of Justice.

A spokesperson for TMX Group said its subsidiary, Shorcan Digital Currency Network, had been working with Paycase “to try to find a viable and mutually-agreeable business solution. We are very disappointed that Paycase has chosen to go this route. TMX disputes the claims made and we plan to defend ourselves vigorously.”



The damages sought are likely among the largest in any crypto-related lawsuit to date; previous cases have demanded as much as $100 million.

Paycase and TMX, both based in Toronto, entered into 10-year contracts for collaboration and revenue sharing on an over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency brokerage desk and creation and administration of data feeds and crypto indexes and the sharing of crypto-index revenue.

According to the complaint, Paycase entered into these contracts on March 21, 2018, with TMX’s subsidiary Shorcan DCN, with the intention to launch a TMX OTC desk and data feed in the second quarter of that year. TMX would receive a cryptocurrency data aggregation platform and a global network of industry participants and leaders, and Paycase benefited from TMX’s stature and clientele, according to the suit.

At the time, Paycase chief executive Joseph Weinberg said Shorcan would be “the first-ever public crypto brokerage desk by an exchange.”

On Aug. 31, 2018, TMX added an amendment to the contract to extend by two weeks a deadline to put together a Statement of Work outlining services, consent, service levels, specifications and delivery timelines for the products. Paycase alleges that it never received this statement.

‘Board issues’

Peter Conroy, president and CEO of Shorcan DCN, encouraged Paycase to buy Shorcan DCN from TMX to bypass “board approval” issues affecting the progress of the products, the suit alleges. In the middle of November, Paycase delivered an offer to purchase Shorcan DCN to Luc Fortin, the director of Shorcan DCN and Global Head of Trading with TMX Group. Paycase claims that TMX announced in or around Sept. 25 that Conroy would be moving to another TMX company but still listed him publicly as president of Shorcan DCN.

Paycase claims that Fortin controlled the business and operations of Shorcan DCN and began to dismantle those operations, including dismissing the two employees hired by Shorcan DCN dedicated to the design, implementation and ongoing operation of the TMX OTC Desk in early December.

On Dec. 6 – the same day as the dismissals – TMX sent Paycase a “Mutual Termination Agreement,” but Paycase claims no event occurred to justify the termination and that there was no termination for convenience in the contract.

Paycase rejected the termination offer and requested a meeting with TMX executives which happened in February 2019. During that time, Shorcan DCN has stopped performing its part of the contract, which Paycase says includes an obligation of continuing performance.

There was no warning of termination, but TMX promised that the products would be operational imminently, the suit claims. Meanwhile, Paycase discussed the company’s digital strategy with TMX executives and trained TMX employees.

In March 2018, TMX also announced that Bank of Montreal would provide banking services as part of the payment and settlement infrastructure of the TMX OTC Desk, similar to the models adopted by Fidelity, E*Trade and TD Ameritrade.

BTI also found that Kraken, Poloniex, Upbit, and Coinbase have consistently been the “cleanest” exchanges since the launch of the BTI Verified program six months ago. The BTI Verified program helps to ensure that trading volume on cryptocurrency exchanges is genuine.

The report also noted that Japan and the United States, two countries with relatively higher amounts of regulatory oversight, had the highest number of “clean” exchanges. However, the report noted that “stricter regulatory frameworks do not always produce the cleanest exchanges,” and pointed to South Korea as an example.

Leading the charge on the other side of the spectrum, with the highest amount of wash trading, were OKEx and Bibox. However, the report noted that although “fake volumes of these exchanges exceed 75%, nevertheless, their real volumes (with wash trades removed) still place them in the Top-20 consistently.”

Other large exchanges that have struggled with wash trading in the past seem to be improving (particularly after becoming part of the Verified program, according to the report): “Binance is now under 10% wash trading after hovering close to 20% through the first few months of 2019. In addition, Bitflyer has been added as our data shows them under 5% over the past few months. We found Gemini around 12-15% at the beginning of the year, but they are now under 10% as well.”

”Among the Top-100 exchanges on CMC, there are 73 currently which are wash trading over 90% of their volumes.”

BTI also pointed out that in spite of widespread awareness around wash trading and promises to do better, popular volume and price data site CoinMarketCap is still listing “numerous scam exchanges in its Top 10 ‘Adjusted Volume’ rankings.”

“Its Top-10 list includes LBank, BW.com, Bit-Z, Coinbene, and OEX, which our data shows wash trading rates at high levels from 96.9% up to 99.7%,” the report explained, adding that “this continues to be because CMC ranks exchanges by trading volume without any basic checks, which motivates trading platforms to report false data and rank higher, thus becoming more visible to users.”

Indeed, BTI’s report said that only about a quarter of the exchanges on CMC publish truthful trade volume data: “according to our calculations, among the Top-100 exchanges on CMC, there are 73 currently which are wash trading over 90% of their volumes.”

Finance Magnates reached out to CoinMarketCap for comment but did not hear back before press time.

The extent to which wash trading plagues cryptocurrency markets was originally brought to light earlier this year when Bitwise Asset Management presented findings to the SEC that the vast majority of Bitcoin trading volume is fake.",2019-09-23 07:31:31+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-is-an-intangible-asset-leading-accounting-standards-body-argues,"Cryptocurrency holdings are neither cash nor financial assets, but meet the definition of an intangible asset, at least according to an influential global accounting standards body.

The Korea Times said in a report on Monday that according to the Korea Accounting Institute, the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) made such decisions after a meeting in London in June.

Indeed, the London-based IFRIC, which sets the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), concluded in a little-noticed document dated June 21 that holdings of cryptocurrency meet the definition of an intangible asset, on the grounds that “(a) it is capable of being separated from the holder and sold or transferred individually; and (b) it does not give the holder a right to receive a fixed or determinable number of units of currency.”

Intangible assets are defined by the committee as non-monetary assets without physical substance. It has also concluded that cryptocurrency is not equity and does not give the holder contractual rights of exchange. Importantly, it said crypto is not cash because it is not, for practical purposes, a medium of exchange.

The Committee added that in some cases, cryptocurrency could be accounted for as inventory if an entity “hold cryptocurrencies for sale in the ordinary course of business.”

Stepping back, the treatment of cryptocurrency was not added to the committee’s standard-setting agenda, which means that the recent disclosure only reflects the thinking of the body and not an actual rule.

But once the committee sets a standard, it tends to be followed, as IFRS is used in about 144 jurisdictions and is required for public companies in Singapore, South Korea and almost all of Europe, though the U.S. has so far been only using the framework of the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Accounting treatment for cryptocurrency has been in discussion since about 2016, with numerous talks held and papers submitted. The IFRIC recently received 23 comment letters on the subject from a wide range of interested parties, including the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), The Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Korea Accounting Standards Board (KASB) and the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ).

The trading platform will list seven cryptocurrencies immediately upon the launch, including bitcoin, Binance coin (BNB), ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin and Tether’s USDT.

Binance.us also revealed it will soon open deposits for another five assets: cardano (ADA), basic attention token (BAT), ethereum classic (ETC), stellar’s XLM and 0x.

Last Wednesday, the new exchange started to open for registration and deposits, but did not disclose a specific date for an official launch.

In the weeks ahead, the platform will roll out additional cryptocurrencies that meet U.S. regulations and compliance standards based on its Digital Asset Risk Assessment Framework. (Binance’s recently launched dollar-linked stablecoin BUSD is notably not supported.)

Users who already have deposits with Binance.com will not see their funds automatically transferred to the U.S. platform, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley previously told CoinDesk. Users for the new exchange will also receive a $15 referral bonus until Nov. 1.

Regulatory barriers

In June, the Malta-based Binance, initially launched in China, revealed that stateside users of its global platform Binance.com were barred from trading.

In the same month, the company said it would partner with California-based BAM Trading Services to set up Binance.US as its US platform. BAM is registered as a money services business with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with an address listed in San Francisco, California.

While the U.S. entity would clear regulatory and compliance barriers, the new platform is still not supported by 13 states, as of Sept. 23, according to a statement from the company.

Users in those 13 states, including New York, Florida and Texas, cannot register for an account at Binance.US. Coley previously explained that the U.S. rollout is to be “gradual” with the 13 states not supported at launch.

The exchange said it would also strengthen its compliance and security practices through partnerships, most notably with software provider Chainalysis and KYC/AML tool provider IdentityMind.

Global expansion

The move is part of a larger expansion by Binance, which launched a fiat-to-crypto exchange on the island of Jersey, a British self-governing dependency in January.

Through that exchange, which caters to traders in Europe and the U.K, its users can trade bitcoin and ethereum against the British pound and the euro.

The Jersey arm listed the cryptocurrency exchange’s own British pound-backed stablecoin, Binance GBP (BGBP), offered on the fiat-to-crypto platform due to trader demand for more stablecoin options, the company said.

With its latest launch in the U.S., Binance has also been trying to push its US dollar-backed stablecoin posing as a potential rival against Libra. BUSD has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

Claims of insufficient evidence

In a Sept. 23 letter on its website, Coinshares claimed the FCA has not provided enough evidence to justify the proposed ban on crypto ETNs — warning its customers that they will no longer be able to trade such products if the ban is approved. The company added:

“We believe that the FCA has not provided sufficient evidence to justify the proposed ban. Through its consultation, the regulator makes little attempt to genuinely evidence its claims and instead ‘cherry picks’ datasets in order to illustrate its perception of crypto assets, ETNs and the perceived harm the FCA believes these products cause.”

ETNs are a type of unsecured debt note issued by an institution that can be held until maturity or be traded.

Coinshares is urging its customers to join them in the fight against the FCA by signing a petition and sending emails and text messages directly to the regulator, expressing their disagreements with the proposed ban. Coinshares wrote:

“We hope you will support us in fighting these proposals by submitting a response [...] The more responses the FCA receives in protest to these measures, the more likely they are to see sense and abandon these proposals.”

20% of rich U.K. millennials have invested in crypto

While the FCA is considering a ban on crypto ETNs, Cointelegraph previously reported that a recent survey by London-based law firm Michelmores LLP revealed that 20% of affluent millennials in the United Kingdom have invested in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.

The survey revealed that among those born between 1981 and 1996 with investable assets of £25,000 ($31,000) or more, 20% had invested in the new asset class.",,,,

An important indicator is showing extreme weakness, claims one crypto analyst, and warns that a “bigger drop” could be coming, even despite Bitcoin having already closed 16 out of the last 21 daily candles red.

OBV Indicator Weakness Could Lead to Bigger Drop in Bitcoin Price

The leading crypto asset by market cap has been trading inside a symmetrical triangle for the last three months, and whatever direction it breaks out in could determine the direction of the trend in the future.

Currently, Bitcoin price is testing the bottom of the symmetrical triangle, where it has repeatedly bounced higher before stopping short of a breakout above. Bitcoin price has closed 16 out of the last 21 daily candles red, and a relief rally should be near.

However, according to one crypto analyst, an important indicator could be signaling that a bigger drop is due, and with Bitcoin price already showing “weakness” near the bottom of its multi-month trading range, a “bigger drop” would cause the triangle to breakdown and possibly retest former lows.

The analyst bases the analysis on the OBV indicator, or on-balance volume. The OBV indicator is used to watch for changes to the flow of volume to help predict price movements before they occur. Volume is often said to “precede price” and the OBV indicator would help crypto analysts spot such a signal.

The metric was first designed by Joseph Granville who described the indicator as “a spring being wound tightly.” When that spring begins to uncoil, price is launched in that direction.

The OBV indicator on Bitcoin price charts has fallen out of a “horizontal channel,” meanwhile price is still neatly contained inside the channel. The analyst says that if the OBV indicator cannot break back into the channel, a nasty drop will ensue.

If Bitcoin price does indeed drop, downside targets for the symmetrical triangle range from $8,500 to as low as $5,800 – which would be a retest of former bear market support. Should Bitcoin fall to such prices, a bounce from there would still be considered bullish and keep the integrity of Bitcoin’s bull run intact.

But that’s if Bitcoin price ever gets there. Buyers are said to be locked and loaded with long orders at around $8,500, where most of the crypto market would be looking for a massive bounce. With so many crypto investors waiting to buy the dip in Bitcoin during a bull market, it is unlikely to ever see some of the lowest downside targets.",2019-09-24 18:01:44+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/major-german-stock-exchange-group-launches-crypto-trading/,"Major German Stock Exchange Group Launches Crypto Trading

Boerse Stuttgart Group, which operates Germany’s second-largest stock exchange, has launched a regulated crypto trading platform, in partnership with Solarisbank. Customers can connect directly to the new exchange and trade bitcoin against the euro without a broker.

German Regulated Crypto Trading Platform

The group which owns Germany’s second-largest stock exchange has launched a digital asset trading platform called Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange (BSDEX). Trading is now live on the platform, Boerse Stuttgart Group announced Monday.

BSDEX “is Germany’s first regulated trading venue for digital assets where investors’ orders are executed directly against each other according to fixed rules,” explained Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange GmbH, the company responsible for the technical operation of the new exchange. Initially, the new platform is only available to a number of invited users. According to the announcement:

As of now, selected users in Germany can connect directly to the trading venue, where they can trade the bitcoin-euro pair initially. BSDEX will be opened up gradually to other retail and also institutional investors, who can register for it now.

Investors can connect directly to the new crypto exchange and trade without a broker. Currently, only market and limit orders are available, but the company said it will add more trading options in the near future. Transaction fees are levied based on the order type, but the exchange affirmed that there are presently no other costs for users.

Peter Grosskopf, CTO at Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange GmbH, explained that “BSDEX will give retail and institutional investors direct access to digital assets and provide flexible and relatively low-cost trading.” He joined the company in April from Solarisbank, which supports the development of the new platform.

Boerse Stuttgart Sees Potential in Crypto

Dirk Sturz, the CEO of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange GmbH, believes that “The market in cryptocurrencies is worth billions, and more digital assets will emerge on the basis of blockchain.” He has worked at Boerse Stuttgart since 2007. “Our goal is to build up the leading European trading venue for those assets,” he remarked.

The company claims that its newly launched digital asset platform complies with the regulatory requirements of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz). The platform aims to offers “a transparent environment and an appropriate legal framework for digital asset trading,” the announcement details, adding:

BSDEX is the next step of Boerse Stuttgart Group in creating an end-to-end ecosystem for digital assets, thus driving the digital transformation of financial markets.

Prior to launching the digital asset exchange, Boerse Stuttgart launched a cryptocurrency app called Bison early this year. It was developed by Sowa Labs, a fintech subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures. The app’s trading partner is Euwax, a subsidiary of Boerse Stuttgart. Users can download the app to buy and sell four cryptocurrencies free of charge: BTC, ETH, LTC, and XRP. “You don’t need a crypto wallet, only a German bank account,” Bison’s website clarifies. The app also offers “Cryptoradar,” which analyses real-time data and provides a sentiment overview of the most discussed cryptocurrencies.

Operations, Partners and Other Crypto Projects

BSDEX is operated as a trading facility by Baden-Wuerttembergische Wertpapierboerse, which also operates the company’s public stock exchange in Stuttgart. Boerse Stuttgart Digital Exchange GmbH, which is responsible for the technical operation of BSDEX, is a joint venture of Boerse Stuttgart GmbH, digital publishing house Axel Springer, and finance portal Finanzen.net.

Blocknox, a subsidiary Boerse Stuttgart Digital Ventures, is responsible for the custody of acquired cryptocurrencies on an escrow basis. Meanwhile, Euwax manages the financial services required for trading.

A Berlin-based fintech company with a full German banking license, Solarisbank is BSDEX’s technology and banking partner responsible for payment processing and the custody of customers’ cash deposits in euro. The bank is authorized and regulated by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bafin) and the European Central Bank (ECB).

Bitwala partnered with Solarisbank last year to offer crypto-friendly bank accounts to its users. Bitbond partnered with the bank in March to process bank transfers during its security token offering. Further, Solarisbank’s Blockchain Factory, which enables users to offer their own crypto service, has partnered with Bison to help bring the app to the mass market.

About eight in 10 (81%) Americans are familiar with at least one type of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is by far the most well-known, with three-quarters (75%) of US adults saying they’ve heard of it. Far fewer are familiar with the separate cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin Cash (24%), or with Ethereum (17%).



Who’s buying cryptocurrency? Millennials, mostly.

Among all US adults who are familiar with at least one kind of cryptocurrency, 18% say they’ve purchased cryptocurrency in the last year. But among millennials familiar with cryptocurrency, this number nearly doubles: 35 percent have bought at least one type of cryptocurrency within the past year.





Millennials are more hopeful about cryptocurrency in general than their Gen X and Baby Boomer counterparts.

More than one-third (35%) of Millennials familiar with cryptocurrency say they believe it is a good investment. Only 21 percent of Gen X’ers and 10 percent of Baby Boomers with the same familiarity level say the same. On the other end of the spectrum, 44 percent of Baby Boomers believe cryptocurrency is a somewhat or very bad investment.

Similarly, Millennials are more likely than older generations to believe cryptocurrencies will become widely accepted as a means of transactions for legal purchases within 10 years.

Four in 10 (40%) Americans familiar with at least one form of cryptocurrency believe cryptocurrencies will become very or somewhat widely accepted for legal transactions before 2030. A majority (55%) of Millennials believe this, along with 41 percent of Gen X’ers and 29 percent of Baby Boomers.

But even as most Americans believe cryptocurrency will become more widely accepted, there are still some reservations about it.

A majority (56%) of those familiar with cryptocurrency say they are not at all interested in the idea of the United States converting to primarily using cryptocurrency instead of US dollars.



Even Millennials, who tend to be more familiar with and confident about cryptocurrencies, tend to say they would be not at all interested (39%) in converting primarily to using cryptocurrency. Another 19% say they would be “not very interested.”



See full results from this survey here.

Methodology: Total unweighted sample size was 1,262 US adults, including 1,035 who are familiar with at least one type of cryptocurrency. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (ages 18+).

Image: Getty",2019-09-24 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/9573/ethereum-expands-blockchain-capacity-by-25-percent,"Ethereum’s network capacity has been expanded by the mining community to allow more transactions to be processed on the network per second. This is in light of increased traffic on the network, largely due to controversial stablecoin Tether and a gambling game called Fair Win.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin relayed last week that block producers were starting to raise gas limits, in light of the network’s congestion. On Ethereum, gas is a separate cryptocurrency used to pay transaction fees and the gas limit essentially controls how many transactions can be included in a block. It’s similar to Bitcoin’s block size limit.

But on Ethereum, gas limits are more organic. Each miner can raise the gas limit by 1/1024 of its current value, slowing edging it up or downwards, as the network gradually adapts to its environment.

Today, miners continued to drive up the gas limit, causing it to break above 10 million per block, an increase of 25 percent over the last week. This means each Ethereum block can now include roughly 25 percent more transactions than they could the week before.

This allows the Ethereum network to process more transactions per second, helping to keep fees lower. But, it does mean the blockchain will get bigger more quickly, making it more expensive and difficult for nodes to keep running the network.

What's Causing Congestion?

Tether appears to be the main culprit behind Ethereum’s increasing transaction count. Over the past few months, the stablecoin has been removing tethers issued on the Bitcoin network, and replacing them with tokens issued on Ethereum. Since so many Tether transactions are made each day, this has put a lot of load on the Ethereum network.

Addressing the situation in an interview with Canadian outlet, The Star, Buterin remarked, “Scalability is a big bottleneck because the Ethereum blockchain is almost full.”

Earlier this month it was revealed that 25 percent of all Ethereum activity was due to Tether transactions.

But Tether isn’t the only coin taking up such a large amount of the Ethereum network. Fair Win, a blockchain-based betting game, has accrued $1.17 million in transaction fees over the past 30 days, showing that it is responsible for a high number of transactions.

According to intelligence provider Glassnode, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) apps are also putting strain on the network as they are become more popular. It notes that around 45 percent of transactions were made by smart contracts—largely used by DeFi applications.

The issue reached fever pitch on September 20, when Ethereum's daily transaction fees surpassed Bitcoin’s for the first time since March 2019. At the time, Ethereum users paid $207,000 in transaction fees versus just $180,000 for Bitcoin. Ethereum diehards saw this as a good thing because it showed that the network was seeing high demand.

But Ethereum rival, Tron CEO Justin Sun took advantage of the situation, encouraging people to use his network for lower fees. In the past he has tried to tempt Ethereum developers away from the platform, offering grants, but with little success.

Rising Controversy

While not causing as much controversy as the Bitcoin Cash proposal to raise the blocksize—which resulted in an almost catastrophic hard fork and Bitcoin SV—the gas limit increase was still regarded by some as a controversial move.

One Bitcoiner, a student at Stanford Law School, argued that the gas limit raise showed the network was centralized, not decentralized as many Ethereum proponents argued. He said that it showed the high level of control that Ethereum miners have over the network.

In response, John Adler, a scalability researcher at ConsenSys (which funds Decrypt), asked, “Did you miss the weeks-long campaign by the community to get miners to raise the gas limit? It was pretty extensive.”

The other issue raised by the gas limit increase, is that it allows for more transactions per block on the Ethereum blockchain. This means the total size of the blockchain will increase at a faster rate—causing more strain on all Ethereum nodes. Miners will have to shell out more money buying equipment with more extensive storage. Something that could help to make the network more centralized if miner numbers declined.

But while the network is slowly growing its capacity, new Ethereum blocks are already starting to hit the new limit, suggesting the gas limit is going to need another raise sooner rather than later.",2019-09-24 15:53:32,https://news.bitcoin.com/market-update-low-volumes-and-uncertainty-shake-crypto-traders/,"Market Update: Low Volumes and Uncertainty Shake Crypto Traders

The majority of digital currency markets have lost a few percentages over the last few days as cryptocurrency trade volume has been waning. Since our last market outlook, more than $20 billion in global trade volume disappeared and this Tuesday’s market data shows there’s only $60 billion in worldwide crypto trades in the last 24 hours.

Crypto Market Losses Across the Board

Cryptocurrency proponents and traders are focused on the market action taking place this week but are uncertain where markets are headed. Most digital currency markets are down between 2-10% in the last day and 5-15% for the week. At the time of publication, the overall market valuation of all 2,000+ cryptocurrencies is roughly $257 billion which is $4 billion less than last week. Bitcoin core (BTC) captures 68.3% of the overall capitalization with a market valuation of around $173 billion.

At $9,649 per coin, BTC is down 2.8% today and 5.8% for the last seven days. The second-largest market cap belongs to ethereum (ETH) which is trading for $195. ETH markets have lost 6.7% this Tuesday and roughly 3.3% for the week. Ripple (XRP) is swapping for $0.26 per coin and has lost 3.1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, litecoin (LTC) still holds the fifth largest cap as each LTC is trading for $65. LTC is the biggest percentage loser today, shedding over 9.8% in the last 24 hours and 10.6% for the week.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

The fourth largest market, bitcoin cash (BCH) is down more than 6% today and down 9% for the week. BCH was holding above the $300 zone for quite some time but has since dropped below the $300 range at $286 per coin. The cryptocurrency currently has an overall market valuation of around $5.16 billion and roughly $1.9 billion in global trades. A few months ago BCH was consistently the sixth and seventh-most traded coin but more recently BCH has captured the fifth position.

Tether (USDT) currently captures 62% of all BCH trades which is followed by BTC with roughly 14.9%. Pairs traded with BCH the most below BTC include USD (12.5%), ETH (6.4%), and KRW (2.1%). The top exchanges today trading the most BCH include Coinbene, ZBG, P2pb2b, Hitbtc, and Okex. Three days ago BCH fell shy of breaking past resistance at $325 per coin and dropped to intraday lows between $305-308 for roughly 36 hours. That specific support level was broken and BCH has since tumbled to support at the $285 price range.

Litecoin’s Freefall

Litecoin has been the focus of many traders as the cryptocurrency seemingly went into freefall over the last 48 hours. On September 23, LTC shaved more than 10% of its value in a matter of no time but has since regained a small percentage back. Nobody is sure why LTC has lost so much value but the coin has been dropping since June.

Before the summer, traders and enthusiasts anticipated the LTC reward halving which seemed to have pushed the price up. Since June, LTC has shaved more than 50% of its overall value and markets have remained dreary. LTC/USD smashed through the psychological level of $70 per coin and has been desperately searching for fresh support in the last eight hours.

Bakkt’s Lackluster Launch, 40% BTC Hashrate Crash, and Sub-$10K

BTC/USD dropped below the $10K zone after the lackluster Bakkt launch on Monday. On Sunday, September 22, BTC was holding steady at $10,060 for most of the afternoon but during the later evening, it started to drop below the psychological price range. The following day when Bakkt opened its physically settled BTC futures markets the price continued to plummet, dropping to the $9,600 zone.

So far the bears have been able to muster more strength than the buyers, but bulls managed to pull the price up a hair between the $9,600-9,750 range. The Bakkt launch didn’t do anything and some traders believe the price was already figured in. Moreover, on September 23, BTC’s network hashrate dropped severely after riding above the 90 exahash region. The processing power dipped to around 57 exahash on Monday and has since jumped back to above the 80 exahash range.

A Looming Economic Storm and Precious Metal Jump

The global economy has been shuddering lately as central banks worldwide have announced monetary and quantitative easing tactics across the board. 18 central banks have slashed interest rates and massive amounts of fresh fiat is being printed alongside negative interest rates becoming the norm and the selling of 50-100 year bonds. Cryptocurrencies have benefited slightly from the macroeconomic storms but precious metals have seen a great push as well. Gold and silver dropped a few days ago but on September 24 both markets have risen significantly. Gold is trading for $1,515 while silver is trading for $18.64 per ounce at the time of writing.

No one knows how the economy will turn out in the next 12 months but many economists predict a worldwide recession. Currently, scalpers and intraday traders are making a few bucks off the price swings stemming from BTC and LTC markets but traders are uncertain of the future. Crypto enthusiasts are hesitant to forecast where crypto markets will go, even though people are very optimistic about the long-term game.

Some people think the end of 2019 will see crypto market fireworks and the start of another giant bull run. Meanwhile, skeptics are not so sure these days and there are those who believe that the sideways action will last a whole lot longer before prices drop lower once again. Crypto trade volume has been dropping significantly and this has caused concern for traders. Whatever the case, traders will be waiting expectantly for the next big move, but which way it goes is anyone’s guess.

French crypto news outlet Cryptoglobe reported the development, announced during Paris Retail Week, on Sept. 24.

25,000 retailers to enter Economy 3.0 via Bitcoin

The new cryptocurrency payments system is launching via a partnership between point-of-sale technology provider Global POS, the EasyWallet application and payments platform Easy2Play.

While payments will be made in Bitcoin (BTC), funds will be automatically converted into euros at the moment of sale.

Conversion services are to be provided by two partners, Deskoin and Savitar, both of whom are currently applying for Digital Asset Service Provider accreditations under France’s PACTE Act.

Alongside Decathlon and Sephora, well-known retailers signing on to the initiative include Boulanger, World House, Intersport, Cultura, Maisons du Monde and Norauto.

Stéphane Djiane, CEO and founder of Global POS, has given a statement proposing that:

""This is an important symbolic step in the evolution of payment methods in France. However, more than a symbol, what we bring to 25,000 outlets is the ability to safely enter the world of Economy 3.0.”

After Bitcoin, altcoins could be next

By enabling consumers to use their cryptocurrency holdings at physical retail locations within a legalized and regulated framework, the initiative aims to broaden adoption beyond the currently estimated 4 million French crypto owners.

While Bitcoin remains the sole cryptocurrency on the cards for now, Dijane has indicated the platform intends to roll out support for altcoins in the future.

In January of this year, a handful of tobaccos shops in Paris started to sell Bitcoin, notwithstanding mixed messages from local regulators and the central bank.

Local news outlet Whales247 reported on Sept. 24 that this is “the first and only service to guarantee digital funds held online will not be lost or stolen.”

Coincover’s service reportedly monitors the wallet at all times and issues warnings in case of suspected theft, recovers funds in case of private key loss, manages key backups, provides cash replacement value in case of theft, and checks for any suspicious activity.

Making crypto less risky

Furthermore, the startup covers over 100 different crypto assets and the company has been invited by the UK’s Department for International Trade as one of the eleven insurance technology companies to share expertise in the Silicon Valley market. Coincover co-founder David Janczewski commented on the development:

“Cryptocurrency ownership is growing fast and becoming more mainstream, but it can still feel like a risky investment. Virtual currencies, by their very nature, are a new concept for many.”

Janczewski also notes that cryptocurrencies have been attributed to crime and scandal since the start as well as hacks and thefts. These are the issues his company is trying to solve, he explained.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, according to industry experts the cryptocurrency insurance market is expected to grow at a faster rate if United States regulators provide more regulatory clarity.

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency insurance is becoming a more prevalent service in the industry, namely for custodial services. For instance, earlier this month Bitcoin (BTC) futures firm Bakkt announced that deposits held in its warehouse are protected by a $125 million insurance policy.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kim-dotcom-to-sell-his-built-on-bitcoin-token-next-month-on-bitfinex,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has announced the relaunch of its Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) platform Tokinex as Bitfinex Token Sales and will offer the token of P2P digital content and monetization blockchain K.IM on October 22.

The news was revealed in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Sept. 24.

A Bitcoin-integrated token

Per the release, K.IM has raised $2.5 million in funding from BnkToTheFuture, Bitcoin Capital and Max Keiser. According to the project’s roadmap, the platform is expected to go live in Q3 2020 alongside a formal listing on Bitfinex.

Entrepreneur, digital rights activist and founder of now-defunct file-sharing website Megaupload, Kim Dotcom, commented on the development:

“Combining the internet with Bitcoin gives us a real chance of achieving the original promise of the internet; freedom of speech, commerce and finance. [...] I founded K.im to allow artists, content creators and digital businesses to cut out all the middlemen and sell content and digital goods without censorship and outside of monopolies.”

According to Dotcom, the Bitcoin blockchain has been able to scale so far and can now support a slew of new possibilities.

“We can finally create our KIM token on top of Bitcoin thanks to recent technical breakthroughs like Lightning and Liquid. Bitfinex is the perfect partner to help us distribute KIM tokens, built on Bitcoin, to those who want to access the freedoms that our products provide,” Dotcom explained.

Bitfinex courts LEO holders

Bitfinex meanwhile notes that the renewed IEO platform will have “direct integrations with the Bitfinex exchange itself.” The company’s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino commented on the current IEO landscape:

“Most IEO’s are marketing campaigns that focus on achieving a short-term result, but that’s not how real businesses are built. Successful businesses are built through long-term, sustainable growth.”

Bitfinex also announced that its native utility token, Unus Sed Leo (LEO), will be part of all future token sales and its holders will have access to higher allocations than those participating with other digital assets.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Slumps as Technical Levels Fold

After a few weeks of thin trading ranges and low volumes, the cryptocurrency market burst into life Tuesday as the market sold-off sharply, with double-digit losses seen across the market. At one stage, the cryptocurrency market lost nearly $39 billion in market capitalization as sellers tried to find bids.

Bitcoin Price Outlook – Preparing a Move or Death by a Thousand Cuts?

There is no one clear reason for the sell-off, but the daily chart has been warning of a move for the last 2-3 weeks as a descending wedge (triangle) pattern took shape. The moment the horizontal support line at $9,080 was broken, the sell-off accelerated all the way down around $8,000 before a small pullback.

Looking ahead, current support is based off the 200-day moving average around $8,300, before a cluster of early-mid June lows near $7,500 come into play. The worry for holders of Bitcoin is that a full measured move of the descending wedge could see BTC hit as low as early-mid $4000s – ($13,840 - $9,080 = $4,720. Then $9,080 - $4,720 = $4,365).

Bitcoin needs to break back above the descending slope, currently around $10.200 to regain any bullish momentum. The CCI indicator does suggest that BTC is heavily oversold and this may stem further losses in the short-term.

Crypto payments gain traction

Cryptocurrency payments are gradually becoming mainstream when it comes to the retail sector.

Announced Wednesday, the seed round was led by London-based FirstMinute Capital, with participation from Seedcamp, Kima Ventures and QCP Capital. The company declined to disclose its valuation.

The company’s skewAnalytics service, launched concurrently with the raise announcement, provides a real-time overview of crypto derivatives markets with more than 100 charts on crypto futures and options. A company of 10 employees, many from traditional finance, London-based Skew is building out features for institutional clients to visualize historical data as well as create dashboards and is hiring in engineering and eventually in distribution.

“Where we want to focus is on corporates and institutions that need this data to run their business,” Skew CEO and co-founder Emmanuel Goh told CoinDesk. “We have had heard concerns from interested traders and firms, and they would be able to generate backtest strategies from this data.”

Goh and his co-founder Tim Noat worked as traders of flow derivatives and exotic options at JPMorgan Chase and Citi, respectively, before starting the company.

The firm’s analytics tools resemble the institutional-grade tools one would find for established products such as foreign exchange and equity, Monica Desai, an investing partner at Kleiner Perkins, told CoinDesk by email.

“As a former trader I’ve found many of their tools (some forthcoming) to feel the most trading floor-native or Bloomberg-esque and am excited to see how they evolve the product as the crypto derivatives space grows exponentially in the next year,” said Desai, who used to manage bond portfolios at JPMorgan.

Derivatives’ day

Crypto derivatives took off in 2018 after the brutal market correction of 2017 and are showing a resurgence driven by institutional adoption, Goh said.

Swaps are being traded in the billions every day on offshore venues, and regulated entities are ramping up offerings. For example, CME plans to launch bitcoin options in Q1 2019 and Intercontinental Exchange’s bitcoin futures platform Bakkt debuted Monday (though it didn’t do much volume).

“Bakkt is the first time large institutions can build physical coins,” Goh said, referring to the fact that the futures contracts are settled in real bitcoin rather than cash. “It’s going to be a moment of proof for the industry.”

While crypto derivatives markets are fragmented, Skew has contracted a number of licensing agreements with crypto exchanges.

According to Skew’s data, aggregated bitcoin options have grown more than sixfold from last year’s fourth quarter to $34.8 million this quarter.

While the ban remains largely in place - crypto-related businesses outside of the US and Japan are still unable to use Google Ads - we always knew that Google would have to review their decision at some point, especially with the cryptocurrency industry showing no sign of slowing down.

Online advertising is one of the most popular and profitable avenues of marketing around, however, we at CoinCorner - and others in the Bitcoin industry - have had to (unwillingly) embrace the challenges of the ban. While the industry has shown resilience - the Bitcoin industry has only gone from strength to strength over the last year-- it obviously impacts businesses like ourselves.

When Google initially announced the ban, we were disappointed (more than half of our monthly marketing budget was spent on Search Engine Marketing), but agreed that it was a sensible move at that point in time. Having been in the crypto industry for longer than most, we’ve seen our fair share of less “legitimate” players using Google to promote misleading products and services, which unfortunately, has only led to consumer confusion and misinformed decisions.

The good news is that the ban has helped to stop a lot of the bad guys from reaching online consumers. Without access to online advertising platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter (the latter two announced their own ban on crypto-related advertising around the same time as Google), these pop-up outfits seem to have disappeared and with less noise, comes more of everything else.

In the last year, we’ve seen the “get rich quick” operations lose momentum and interest, which has made room for the “in it for the long haul” companies (like ourselves) to create and innovate. As a result, there have been some incredible technological advancements made in Bitcoin, which have helped strengthen the infrastructure and further secured its future.

Being based in the UK, we don’t yet have the ability to access Google’s advertising platform again. This is something that we hope to see change soon, but despite reaching out to Google for an update on a number of occasions over the last year, most recently only 2 weeks ago, we keep receiving the same message:

“There is no such update available at our end with regards to when our advertising services will be available to cryptocurrency exchanges in countries other than US and Japan.”

It’s frustrating, but unfortunately there is nothing we can do but wait for Google to continue to review their policy; we hope this will come as they grow more comfortable with cryptocurrency. In the meantime, although the reversal of the ban in the US and Japan may have seemed like a small step, it was a small step in the right direction, which gives the rest of the industry hope that attitudes towards cryptocurrencies will change in the near future.

We continue to embrace ever-changing restrictions like this, which seemingly appear to stand in the way of Bitcoin adoption. However, the industry is creative, innovative and unconventional and the genuine companies operating in it will continue to find ways to spread the word of Bitcoin and its benefits as the Future of Money.",2019-09-25 08:57:59,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/40964/fold-raises-2-5m-to-build-out-its-bitcoin-payments-and-rewards-offering,,2019-09-25 12:59:26+00:00

Wallets are a necessity for cryptocurrency users and their creation is a strong indication of how fast the popularity of decentralized digital money grows. The number of crypto wallets and their users has been increasing rapidly since the creation of Bitcoin. Spikes usually coincide with rising cryptocurrency prices during bullish periods, but it’s worth noting that the general trend has always been positive, and has become exponential in the past few years.

Sharp Increase of New Wallets in Q2, 2019

Market data provider Statista continuously tracks multiple indicators in the crypto space. The platform revealed that the number of blockchain wallet users has reached over 40 million at the end of the first half of 2019. That represents an enormous increase from less than 8 million users in the second quarter of 2016, as per the report. The numbers look even more staggering when you realize the study is based on the growth registered by a single company, Blockchain.com.

The well-known provider of crypto products offers one of the popular wallet clients on the market which supports bitcoin cash (BCH) among other cryptocurrencies. The total number of wallet users worldwide is hard to estimate, but in the past three years alone, Blockchain.com has recorded a five-fold increase in its wallet users. Blockchain.com’s own more recent data shows the user count has reached over 42 million, as of September 25.

Looking at the graph in the Statista report, two pronounced spikes in the number of new wallets can be seen during the examined period. The first one occurred between the third and fourth quarter of 2017. It coincided with the rise in the price of digital assets at the time. The second jump was registered in Q2 of 2019, when Blockchain wallet users increased by around 6 million. The chart published on the Blockchain.com website shows a steady increase until around the beginning of 2016, after which the growth became exponential.

A Choice of Wallets Available to Crypto Users

A wide and expanding choice of cryptocurrency wallets is available to users nowadays. From hardware devices that feature improved security, such as Ledger and Trezor, to multiple software applications providing greater everyday usability, like Electrum, Exodus and Jaxx.

Popular custodial platforms have also been registering significant growth of their users over the past couple of years. For example, U.S. crypto wallet and trading service provider Coinbase now claims to have over 30 million users. When it stopped publishing detailed user data on its website in November 2017, the exchange had around 13 million customers with 45 million cryptocurrency wallets.

After the bearish 2018, which put the whole crypto industry in a difficult spot, this year brought a revived interest in cryptocurrencies. Markets began their upward movement in April and remained mostly positive and stable up until the recent modest decline. Throughout the year, even during periods of setbacks, the number of cryptocurrency wallets has continued to increase steadily.

Bitcoin.com’s own offering is no exception. Downloads of the Bitcoin.com Wallet, which was introduced in August 2017, have more than doubled since last year to over 4.7 million at the time of writing. The light mobile client is available for Android and iOS devices.

The wallet supports bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) and comes with many useful features allowing you to purchase and exchange cryptocurrency from the app. If you are looking for a desktop version, Bitcoin.com recommends the Badger Wallet.

Interestingly, also born from the ashes of the mortgage crisis was the United States government’s adoption and unabated use of quantitative easing (QE).

However, according to some, there’s more of a connection between Bitcoin (BTC) and the government’s use of QE than just their origins. A recent tweet from BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes highlighted this supposed correlation:

“QE4eva is coming. Once the Fed gets religion again, get ready for #bitcoin $20,000.”

Nodding to the Federal Reserve’s latest decision to pump the economy with billions of dollars, Hayes brazenly suggests a relationship between a growth in Bitcoin’s price and an increase in QE. But is this idea entirely out of the realms of possibility?

A bailout for banks

At the start of last week, banks all over the U.S. ran out of cash, as interest rates in the overnight market — a platform reserved for interbank lending — shot up to 10%. forcing the Fed to act. On Tuesday, $53 billion was mainlined into the financial sector in order to quell short-term interest rates. Known as an “overnight repo operation,” the Fed spent $40.8 billion on treasuries, $11.7 billion on mortgage-back securities and a further $600 million on agency bonds, all in an attempt to lessen borrowing costs from the proverbial line in the sand.

This line was drawn back in July, when the Fed set a renewed target range for interest rates of 2% to 2.5%. Come Wednesday, and with overnight lending rates still sky-high, this target was redrawn to a range of 1.75% to 2%, resulting in another $75 billion siphoned from the Fed’s coffers.

However, it didn’t stop there. On Thursday, with rates citing a spike of approximately five times the acceptable benchmark, the Fed released a statement bracing the market for an additional $75 billion. Friday marked yet another $75 billion in capital injections.

In total, $278 billion funneled into the markets. Finally, the Fed did away with the daily charade and announced that further operations would continue regularly through to mid-October. Previously, sky-high repo rates declined following the injection of $278 billion.

Fed Chairman Jay Powell mostly brushed the repo operations off, suggesting that while they were integral to the smooth running of the market, they had no “implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy.”

These repurchasing agreements, or repos, typically involve the overnight lending of government securities on the open market, with distributors selling to investors with the expectation of repurchasing the following day. While these generally take place between financial institutions, once in a while, the Fed will get involved — entering into agreements to regulate the monetary supply. This latest flurry of investment marks the first time in over a decade that the Fed has intervened with a repo agreement, with the last being the 2008 global financial crisis.

The Goldilocks paradigm

It’s perhaps important to make a distinction between the Fed’s recent repo agreements and QE. Broadly speaking, while open-market operations are an inevitable step toward quantitative easing, these two policies differ significantly. To use a reasonably reductive explanation, within repo operations, the Fed uses reserves to buy government assets such as treasuries on the overnight lending market to influence interest rates. Whereas under QE, the Fed “prints” money — or rather, generates it electronically — and uses it to purchase securities with the direct intent and consequence of expanding the monetary supply.

QE is typically used as a last resort. For the Fed, this last resort comes when it fails in its mandate to keep interest rates in their designated sweet spot — thus, we have the principle of a goldilocks economy. If interest rates climb too high, pricing people out, a recession can occur; too low, and there’s a risk of excessive economic growth, inflation and subsequent currency devaluation.

Currently, the pressure from rising lending rates is forcing the Fed into a corner by which it needs to reduce its target to maintain an equilibrium. However, with four consecutive days of repo transactions last week, and a new pledge to continue buying government assets, it looks like quantitative easing could be next on the agenda.

Can quantitative easing act as momentum for Bitcoin?

While the objective of QE is to revitalize the economy via low rates, providing a new incentive for borrowing and investing, it can also drive investors to diversify more risk into their portfolios, as they look to maintain the same yield. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Alex Krüger, a cryptocurrency trader and economist, explained what this expanding desire for risk may entail for Bitcoin:

“QE would push longer interest rates lower and thus push some investors out the risk curve, i.e., seeking riskier investments to achieve desired returns. One can theorize some of that money would end in Bitcoin, adding upward pressure to prices.”

Additionally, this notion of excessive risk-taking during quantitative easing was highlighted in a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said that “prolonged monetary ease may also encourage excessive financial risk-taking, in the form of increased portfolio allocations to riskier assets.” Thanks to its widespread stigma as a “risk-on” asset, Bitcoin could, in theory, reap some of the benefits afforded by increased demand for more perilous investments.

A modest supplement of the previous theory is established from the increase in monetary supply. Simply put, the more fiat funneled into the financial system, the more disposable capital there is for investments. Mati Greenspan, eToro’s senior market analyst, noted this while talking to Cointelgraph, suggesting that, “Some of that money will likely be channeled into Bitcoin.”

So, why Bitcoin? The nascent protocol is known as the antithesis of the financial system. It was born literally to oppose and subvert traditional banking. With such an option at their disposal, and with growing concerns of a systemic collapse, it’s not inconceivable that people are turning to Bitcoin for capital refuge.

Furthermore, a somewhat darker theory relates to the relationship between QE and currency devaluation. As interest rates decrease and the monetary supply rises, domestic currency inflates and loses value. Interestingly, for some — especially during a trade war — a weaker currency is a welcome byproduct of QE due to exports becoming cheaper and more competitive on a global scale. For Bitcoin believers, it is just another sign of the imminent collapse of the financial system.

With the defacto world reserve currency on its last legs, Bitcoin’s purported role as a macro hedge is becoming more of a reality. Broadcaster, Bitcoin bull and fiat doomsayer Max Keiser is one such propagator of this theory. In a conversation with Cointelgraph, Kieser suggested that much of Bitcoin’s value is based on the denigration of the financial industry:

“QE (debt-monetization) is designed to keep zombie banks alive. Bitcoin was introduced to battle zombie banks and QE and the price has exploded higher in response to the increase in global reliance on the accounting fraud and chicanery of QE. There is no end to QE. There is no scenario other than all fiat everywhere crashes to zero (as all fiat has done over 300 years). And there is no top to the Bitcoin price. $1 million and above is virtually a certainty at this point.”

Bitcoin: A hedge against economic uncertainty?

If a genuine connection between QE and Bitcoin’s price is to be seen, then a clear definition of BTC’s asset status needs to be made. Seemingly in accord with Kieser, economist and CEO of Global Macro Investor Raoul Pal has been especially vocal on this topic as of late.

In August, Pal delivered a tweetstorm, declaring a worldwide currency crisis and advocating for investment in Bitcoin, as it “trades like a call option on a new system.” Speaking to Cointelegraph, Pal communicated that while Bitcoin may not be the best bet against macro risk, it will likely play a significant role in the event of a financial collapse:

“I view BTC as an option on the End Game to the current monetary system. No, it is not a good day to day macro hedge. It is a macro systemic risk hedge, however. That is very different. It does play a decent role in capital flight too in emerging markets.”

Wall Street veteran and a member of the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force Caitlin Long similarly believes in Bitcoin’s budding utility as a hedge against economic instability. Within a recent article, Long lambasted the fragile nature of the financial system, referring to last week’s repo events as “a modern version of a bank run.” Nevertheless, Long maintains that it provided further confidence in Bitcoin:

“Bitcoin is not a debt-based system that periodically experiences bank run-like instability. In this regard, Bitcoin is an insurance policy against financial market instability. Bitcoin is no one’s IOU. It has no lender of last resort because it doesn’t need one.”

Krüger appeared to agree that Bitcoin is only a hedge against the additional, tail risk of central bankers and/or governments losing control. However, Krüger added the caveat that the Fed’s execution of QE “would not represent losing control.”

This is an important distinction to make when weighing up any correlation between QE and Bitcoin’s price action. On this point, Krüger remarked that there had been no precedent that shows any such relationship, yet:

“There is no evidence BTC has benefited from prior QE rounds. However, the more engrained with traditional markets Bitcoin becomes, the higher the impact one should expect. The QE impact should be significant if by then BTC is already behaving from a macro standpoint as digital gold, which is not yet the case.”

Krüger’s assertion seems to hold some merit. During Bitcoin’s short history, QE has had very little impact. However, it could be argued that price discovery during these periods was still underway. As Krüger notes, this correlation could strengthen as Bitcoin matures. The Fed’s balance sheet tends to increase in conjunction with various QE rounds, as it did from 2008 to 2014, but it also seems to share very little correlation to any increases in Bitcoin’s price.

How likely is QE, anyway?

While the ongoing repo agreements hint to some further measures to avoid inflation, it isn’t exactly concrete proof that QE will be initiated in its traditional sense. However, if the Fed continues to follow the global monetary policy of other sluggish economies, it will perhaps be an inevitability.

In September 2019, the ECB announced a fresh bout of economic stimulus, reintroducing an aggressive phase of quantitative easing to the tune of 20 billion euros per month, starting in November.

The ECB also slashed interest rates further into the negative, from -0.4% to -0.5%, much to the anguish of President Donald Trump, whose competitive nature came out in full swing. In a trademark Twitter tirade, he remarked.

“European Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!”

Trump’s pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates to the negative gives a fair bit of credence to the possibility of the U.S. entering its own QE phase. On this point, Greenspan remained unperturbed, suggesting that the ongoing repo operations were enough to sustain the economy for now:

“The ECB has rekindled their QE program. For the moment, the Fed in the United States is content to ease policy through interest rate manipulation.”

Similarly, Krüger noted that U.S. interest rates still had room to breathe before Federal Reserve Chairman Powell considered implementing QE:

“Powell has explicitly said the Fed would consider using QE again if ‘we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound — again, not something we are expecting.’ Rates are at the moment far from the effective lower bound (i.e. 0%).”

Nevertheless, Kruger included the caveat that QE might be adopted “during Trump’s 2nd term.” Indeed, with the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S., it isn’t likely that Trump will give up exerting his dovish will on the Fed. In recent months, a quasi-currency war has threatened to develop between the two nations. In June, the first rate cut in Bitcoin’s nascent history was imposed by the Fed, with Powell alluding to the escalating U.S.–China trade war.

Come early August, China combatted a fresh batch of U.S. tariffs by devaluing its own currency. To counter the move, Trump pressured the Fed to lower interest rates once again, to which it eventually acquiesced last week. Ruminating on this to Cointelgraph, Naeem Aslam, market analyst for a trading platform ThinkMarkets, suggested that QE may advance if the trade war lingers:

“I think if the trade war continues, then the Fed will be left with no other option but to continue the path of rate cuts. What matters the most is the pace and the aggressiveness of the Fed through which they cut the interest rates.”

Thanks to the possibility of a looming currency war and the subsequent economic depression that may bring, a Reuters poll relays that the median probability of a U.S. recession in the next two years stands at 45%. With such high estimations of a rising recession, it seems almost undoubtedly that QE will continue and proliferate.

As for a consensus on Bitcoin’s potential reaction to quantitative easing, it’s perhaps too early to tell. While numerous outcomes such as a systemic breakdown, an escalation between China and the U.S., or even something as simple as an increased risk appetite could all lead Bitcoin higher, there has been no real precedent to allude that it will.

The company said it will add more cryptocurrencies in the coming months.

The company said users will not be able to withdraw their cryptocurrencies to an external wallet, in order to maintain a closed system that can better secure assets. In the future it may consider adding a transfer feature.

Chief executive officer Anthony Noto, a former chief operating officer at Twitter, said cryptocurrency trading has been the most requested service from its existing customers.

“Feedback from our members has made it clear that a significant percentage are not only interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies but are also already buying and selling crypto,” Noto said in a statement.

The service is being offered by SoFi Digital Assets and is available in 36 states including Alabama, California, and Ohio. It is not available in New York. The minimum order size per transaction is $10, and the maximum order per day, per individual, is $50,000. Customer orders will be filled using Coinbase.

SoFi said the service will be free initially, but it will eventually charge a markup of up to 1.25% on crypto transactions.

“I believe in the power of distributed ledger technology. But one of the things about crypto is it’s not always broadly available in a way that’s easy, transparent, and fast,” Noto said in an interview with Fortune.

SoFi has said its app has over 800,000 users. The company said it is the first platform to offer automated and active investing with stocks, exchange-traded funds, and crypto through a single app.

Talking in interview with Nikkei on Thursday, Zuckerberg was asked about the expected date of the stablecoin’s arrival, to which he replied:

“Obviously we want to move forward at some point soon [and] not have this take many years to roll out,” he said. “But right now I’m really focused on making sure that we do this well.”

Since the launch of Libra’s white paper in June, regulators worldwide have been strident in their objections to the project, saying it poses not only a risk to financial stability and could be used in financial crimes, but it’s also a threat to sovereign currencies. Notably, lawmakers in the U.S. and France have called for the project to be halted.

The Libra project had appeared to have been sticking to its guns on the 2020 target, with Libra Association managing director and COO Bertrand Perez saying in mid September that “We are firmly maintaining our launch schedule, between the end of the first half of the year and the end of 2020.”

Zuckerberg also said that Facebook is now taking a more cautious approach when bringing forward projects like Libra that are ” very sensitive for society,” allowing a period for consultation and “working through the issues.”

“That’s a very different approach than what we might have taken five years ago,” he said.

CoinDesk has reached out to the Libra Association, the non-profit set up to manage and develop the cryptocurrency, to ask if its plans had changed regarding the launch schedule. We will update this article if and when a reply is received.

In related news, David Marcus, CEO of Calibra (the entity building a digital wallet for the project), has been making the case for Libra as an improvement on traditional payment systems.

In a Medium post Wednesday, he wrote that Libra would be a “game-changer” for the public, arguing that “existing ‘money networks’ are closed and are not well interconnected.”

They’re also outdated, he said, explaining:

“Some of these systems were built in the 1960s and 70s, and while they’ve received upgrades since then, they often live on top of legacy, fragmented infrastructure.”

The need for intermediaries in traditional methods of payment also “means delays, and added cost at every step of the way,” Marcus added.

Libra, on the other hand, will enable value to be moved around the world at in “near real-time” and at “an incredibly low cost.”

Marcus further set out his big dream for Libra, saying:

“Just like SMTP allowed any email provider to interoperate with other email providers, Libra can be the ‘protocol’ that will enable fast, cheap, and stable money movement across service providers, institutions, and people all around the world.”

This, he claimed, would reduce the costs of running payments systems, doing away with intermediaries and reducing “operational complexity and overhead.” It would also make it easier for people to send and receive money and lower the “barrier of access to modern digital money and financial services.”

Although blockchains have been called “truth machines,” the industry surrounding them is anything but straightforward.

Shortly after the messaging app Kik announced this week it will close its platform because of legal fees resulting from the launch of its Kin cryptocurrency, a report emerged claiming that CEO Ted Livingston resigned from the company via a drunken text. The following day, though, Livingston refuted the report, explaining that he’d been on an international flight, and therefore not using the internet at the time of the supposed message.

As anxiety builds about Kik’s cryptocurrency (and a related SEC lawsuit), the Livingston hoax was perfectly timed. An impostor preyed on Kik near its peak in the news cycle, used the CEO’s likeness in their communications, and issued statements mirroring those previously published by Kik on its Medium blog.

Although the impostor wasn’t exactly sophisticated (they used the Telegram handle “Ted E. Bear”) their misinformation resulted in an article on CoinDesk—since removed—and Livingston’s supposed resignation spread quickly across social media.

Kik is hardly the first crypto company that’s been the subject of a hoax or misreporting. In July, the Tron Foundation’s Justin Sun was reportedly detained for investigation in China. It turned out, though, that Sun was recovering from kidney stones, resting in San Francisco. In 2017, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was the subject of a death hoax, originating on the internet forum 4chan.

Misinformation is as old as money, and the history of finance is littered with examples of swindles and cons. From the South Sea Bubble of 18th century England to penny stock schemes peddled by the Wolf of Wall Street, investors have often been burned by opportunities too good to be true.

Part of this is endemic to any nascent industry, where entrepreneurs make bold claims about what their companies can achieve. The excitement and hyperbole around bitcoin and cryptocurrency also seem to have infected crypto journalism, whether it was reporting the NSA developing a cryptocurrency (it’s not) or unmasking Satoshi Nakamoto (they got the wrong guy).

For any reporter, getting a story—or a fact—wrong is a disaster. It damages your credibility and forces you to issue an update or retraction. I’ve been through this humbling experience before.

Whether examining a new consensus algorithm or checking on executive moves, cryptocurrency media faces a unique challenge. The informal communications channels (e.g., Reddit, Telegram, Medium) preferred by crypto projects make it difficult to weed out misinformation. The thousands of investors who parrot company talking points make it challenging to determine whether a project is actually delivering on its promises. Some companies, like Ripple, have seemingly rewritten history to avoid regulatory issues.

Unlike companies in the S&P 500, crypto projects often publish blog posts and tweets, not press releases. Determining what’s happening with crypto companies based in non-English speaking countries adds another layer of complexity.

Perhaps it’s indicative of 2019. We live in an era when foreign policy decisions and tariffs get announced on Twitter, too. So, maybe cryptocurrency companies are just ahead of the curve. However, informality and the biases of investors or reporters can lead to errors.

A successful hoax often relies on speed and fear, two vectors that tap directly into the crypto community. Traders are always online and they’re determined to get every possible edge. The outrageous characters in this world—obsessed with privacy, anti-corporate zeal, and arcane algorithms—are also prime targets for scam artists and pranksters. In a sense, the hijinks and humor feel like a part of cryptocurrency itself.

OH, NO! THE PRICE

Bitcoin’s price plunged 13% on Tuesday. In less than one hour, the price of bitcoin fell from around $9,500 to $8,300, creating large arbitrage opportunities for cryptocurrency traders this week. Market watchers variously attributed the drop to weak demand for Bakkt’s bitcoin futures and an unexpected slowdown in bitcoin mining.

A few days before the price drop, the bitcoin network’s hash rate (or mining power) suddenly dipped from 98 million tera hashes per second Sept. 21 to 67 million Sept. 22. That means the miners securing the network performed significantly fewer calculations than expected. Observers speculated on Twitter that a power outage at a mining facility might’ve been to blame.

""Buy it,"" the founder, CEO and chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital said on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" two days after the price of bitcoin plunged to its lowest level since June to $7,944.33. The popular cryptocurrency was down 5% at $8,054.94 on Thursday afternoon, according to Coindesk.

The daily price of bitcoin ""doesn't matter,"" Yusko said, adding its user base has grown every year since 2009. He admits the network is still pretty small.

Yusko then compared the cryptocurrency to Amazon, saying, ""the price of any asset fluctuates.""

Earlier this year, Yusko said the cryptocurrency could hit $30,000 before the next major pullback, saying ""we are in the next parabolic move."" At the time, bitcoin's price was around $12,000.

Bitcoin has seen other notable bouts of volatility throughout its existence. The cryptocurrency rallied to almost $20,000 at the end of 2017, only to come crashing down the following year. Bitcoin has more than doubled in price this year.

— CNBC's Kate Rooney contributed to this report.",2019-09-26,https://www.coindesk.com/top-10-alternative-cryptocurrencies-hit-6-month-lows,"Nearly all top 10 alternative cryptocurrencies by Market Capitalization have hit their respective 6-month lows after bitcoin’s rapid price slide dragged the rest of the markets into the red on Tuesday.

Litecoin (LTC), EOS (EOS), Binance Coin (BNB), and Stellar (XLM) dropped to their lowest point in over 6-months shortly after BTC’s major sell-off forced traders to exit the market in quick succession.

XRP (XRP) stands as the outlier on the week after hitting a 658-day low of $0.22 on Sept. 24, marking it as the biggest loser and single-day loss amongst the top 10 by market value.

As seen above XRP leads by a large margin after reaching its lowest point in almost 2 years, while bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin SV (BSV) and Ether (ETH) suffered the least after hitting only 4-month lows.

Still, the event marks a period where the primary trend for all cryptocurrencies has been thrown into contention after the majority passed below their respective 200-day moving average, a sign of long-term market health, in July.

Further, a total of $16 billion has been siphoned out of the alternative cryptocurrency market since Sept. 24, measured by its total market capitalization excluding bitcoin.

The onus now resides with the bulls to begin appearing in larger numbers to drive values higher, lest the downward pressure forces another major sell-off with an expected target of around $6,200 from bitcoin’s measured move from its latest descending triangle breakdown.

Other cryptocurrencies were hit by the same plunge. All of the biggest markets dropped around the same time and have stayed at those lower prices since, according to market Coinbase.

Bitcoin is still up over the year, however. It has gained more than 30 per cent since the same time in 2018.

Analysts blamed the sudden drop in the price on a number of technical issues, but said that it was still possible that its value would continue to grow.

“Bitcoin has been due a price break for some time,"" said Simon Peters, analyst at eToro, in the wake of the drop. ""Since reaching $14k back in June, the cryptoasset has been making 'lower highs' and 'higher lows', forming a 'symmetrical triangle' chart pattern converging towards an apex. Generally, this pattern precedes a breakout either higher or lower, and this is what we saw yesterday.""

Peter pointed to the launch of Bakkt, a new platform for institutional investors, which has seen lower than expected volumes that disappointed many investors.

“Pessimism over the level of activity on Bakkt sparked this most recent sell-off. However, it was the liquidation of $600million worth of long positions on platforms like Bitmex that caused the price to dramatically slump by over a $1,000 in a 30 minute period,"" he said.",2019-09-27 11:37:04+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-binance-launches-dedicated-staking-platform,"Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched a dedicated staking platform, according to a company announcement published on Sept. 26.

The new service will enable Binance users to deposit their token holdings and earn staking rewards, but without having to set up their own nodes to fulfill minimum staking amounts and/or time lengths.

Staking vs. mining cryptocurrencies

In blockchains that use a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) system — as opposed to Proof-of-Work (PoW) like in Bitcoin — nodes in the network engaged in validating blocks, rather than mining them. A deterministic algorithm selects block validators based on the number of tokens a given node has staked in their wallet — i.e. deposited as collateral in order to compete to add the next block to the chain.

Staking holdings in a PoS network can yield significant percentage returns, depending on the size of the participant’s stake. This offers investors the chance to earn a form of “interest” on their holdings, as long as they are willing to lock up their funds to both maintain — and potentially profit from — a given blockchain network.

Binance’s offer, community responses

In its announcement, Binance has revealed plans to update its staking calculation methodology on Oct. 1, in order to establish what it deems to be a more accurate and fair distribution of the rewards. This will be achieved by providing multiple snapshots for user balances within a given day, rather than a single daily snapshot.

Not all cryptocurrency commentators perceive Binance’s launch of staking services as a positive moment for the industry.

A tweet from Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, emphasized to Binance users this morning that:

“You literally don't have to do anything. Your funds on Binance automatically participate. You can still trade as you normally would.”

To which Dovey Wan — founding partner of blockchain-based investment company Primitive Ventures — has responded:

“That’s why RIP for all StakingaaS Exchanges gonna eat it, custodial wallets gonna eat it, even PoW pool gonna eat it, and then the remaining is a race to the bottom Bad business, just bad.”

Taking Wan’s cue, several commentators on crypto Twitter mulled the centralization drawbacks of a staking service operated by a leading industry exchange, yet Wan foregrounded a different argument, tweeting:

“I’m assuming the opportunity cost on staking/locking is flat lol if considering that it’s a complete GG. So most of them [token issuers] need to inflate massive amount (further dilute the value and further sell pressure down the road)”

As reported, Binance had apparently inadvertently earned staking rewards on its Stellar holdings this summer. Once it had discovered the profits, the exchange chose to launch support for staking the token as well as to distribute the already-accrued earnings among users.",,https://www.theweek.co.uk/cryptocurrencies/103523/bitcoin-price-crypto-market-falls-into-chaos-as-facebook-libra-delays-loom,"Bitcoin values are in a state of “chaos” after prices plummeted by almost £1,000 in the space of an hour.

The virtual currency market experienced a “dramatic crash” on Tuesday afternoon, causing bitcoin prices to “plunge” in a matter of “minutes”, The Independent reports.

The cryptocurrency began trading at $9,790 (£7,950) mark on Tuesday morning, before slipping to $9,490 (£7,700) at about 7.30pm, according to ranking site CoinMarketCap.

Prices then fell sharply to $8,420 (£6,830) an hour later, and values have continued to decline, the ranking site notes. As of 2.30pm UK time today, bitcoin was trading just above the $8,000 (£6,490) mark.

As if often the case in the crypto world, bitcoin’s declines sent shockwaves through the rest of the market. The Independent says Tuesday’s crash resulted in 20% being “wiped off all of the biggest digital currencies”.

Is Libra coin to blame?

Facebook’s upcoming cryptocurrency, Libra coin, was widely regarded as being one of the key drivers of bitcoin’s resurgence after its grand unveiling in June.

However, the digital coin has faced intense scrutiny from banks and regulators over competition and privacy concerns. It now appears that Facebook chief, Mark Zuckerberg, may not release the coin in 2020, as had been originally planned.

Speaking to Japanese newspaper Nikkei Asian Review, Zuckerberg said: “Obviously we want to move forward at some point soon [and] not have this take many years to roll out.

“But right now I’m really focused on making sure that we do this well… A lot of people have had questions and concerns, and we’re committed to making sure that we work through all of those before moving forward.”

Zuckerberg’s comments came after Tuesday’s price crash, so it’s unlikely to be the driver behind the crash.

However, Forbes hints that Zuckerberg’s comments may have dampened the spirits of investors, resulting in bitcoin prices dropping by a further 5% since Tuesday.

So what caused the value slump?

Analysts are blaming a “a number of technical issues” for the crash, the Independent reports. This includes problems with Bakkt, a trading platform for institutional investors, which has seen “lower than expected” trading volumes since its launch on Monday.

“Pessimism over the level of activity on Bakkt sparked this most recent sell-off,” Simon Peters, an analyst at online trading firm eToro, told the news site.

However, he said the cryptocurrency’s “fundamentals such as hashrate”, the speed in which computers crunch the bitcoin code, are looking “strong” and “adoption of crypto is still moving forward at pace.

“With those conditions in mind, we could see the price rise back up to $10,000 within the space of the next month,” Peters concluded.",,https://www.coindesk.com/new-malware-swaps-out-crypto-wallet-addresses-as-you-type-them,"A new bit of malware called Masad Stealer can replace wallet addresses as you type them thanks to malicious code injected into your browser.

The program dumps this information to the malware controller’s Telegram account, ensuring relative security for the data it steals. It can also clip and change monero, litecoin, zcash, dash and ethereum addresses automatically and uses special search functions to pinpoint these addresses on your clipboard. Once it swaps the addresses it can intercept crypto as its being sent to legitimate wallets.

The particular version of the malware Juniper studied sent crypto to this wallet which currently contains almost a one full bitcoin.

“Based on our telemetry, Masad Stealer’s main distribution vectors are masquerading as a legitimate tool or bundling themselves into third party tools,” wrote the research organization. “Threat actors achieve end user downloads by advertising in forums, on third party download sites or on file sharing sites.”

The software masquerades as useful-looking software like Tradebot_binance.exe, Galaxy Software Update.exe, and Fortniteaimbot 2019.exe. Once infected, the computer then begins communicating with the command and control Telegram channel and sends back private data.

The malware allegedly costs $40 on the dark web and is completely configurable and very dangerous, said Juniper.

“Juniper Threat Labs believes that Masad Stealer represents an active and ongoing threat. Command and Control bots are still alive and responding as of this writing, and the malware appears to still be available for purchase on the black market,” wrote the researchers.

Single Sign-On",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ecb-president-stablecoins-and-crypto-not-suitable-money-substitutes,"Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB) shares his views on stablecoins, the future of crypto assets, and possible digital form of the Euro.

Monitoring developments in crypto

On Sept. 27, in a letter addressed to European parliament member Eva Kaili, ECB president Mario Draghi noted that the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) is closely monitoring developments in the cryptocurrency industry. Draghi added:

“The ESCB is analysing crypto-assets and stablecoins with a view to understanding their potential implications for monetary policy, the safety and efficiency of payments and market infrastructures, and the stability of the financial system.”

Despite displaying a positive approach towards new technologies, Draghi apparently thinks that stablecoins and cryptocurrency in general are of little value. He said:

“Thus far, stablecoins and crypto-assets have had limited implications in these areas and are not designed in ways that make them suitable substitutes for money.”

Draghi did add that due to the continuous technological innovation and rapid evolution in the cryptocurrency industry, the ECB’s assessment might be different in the future.

Digital Eurocoin looms?

Draghi also addressed the opportunities and challenges that come with releasing a digital form of the Euro coin. He pointed out that the technological part of a European stablecoin is not the issue, but “rather its utility in terms of costs and benefits to the public.”

Draghi concluded his letter by pointing to Target Instant Payment Settlement service for the Eurozone, which was launched in November 2018, adding:

“It enables payment service providers to offer fund transfers to their customers in real time and around the clock, every day of the year.”

The cryptocurrency industry is evolving quickly.

London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech – Join Now

Two years ago, the space was almost completely driven by raw hype: Bitcoin was up, up, up, and anyone who came within ten feet of the industry was told that if they invested, their pockets would become heavy. And it was true–for a while.

Since the boom of 2017, however, the cryptocurrency industry has endured a major market crash, months of doldrums, and a slow resurrection; as a result, the companies and individuals that were surviving on hype alone have largely been purged from the space–and so too have the news media outlets that allowed industry participants to shamelessly shill their products (for a fee, of course.)

Indeed, the crypto news media sites that have survived to this point are the ones that have managed to roll with the punches: building and improving methods of maintaining journalistic integrity for a new industry, hiring journalists with a good understanding of the technology in the industry, and maintaining traditions of transparency (in most cases.)

While this may seem like honorable principles, these news outlets have not had a choice–with less and less capital flowing into the space, and fierce competition, creating top-quality content is a top priority. How have the crypto news sites that the industry relies on managed to stay afloat?

How has the cryptocurrency news media industry changed over the last several years?

Marie Tatibouet, Chief Marketing Officer at Gate.io, explained the evolution of journalism in the crypto space to Finance Magnates this way: “during the ICO craze, a lot of crypto media started charging companies looking for media coverage, often without even indicating it was a sponsored post, and because funds were flowing, they got away with it.”

However, the end of the crypto boom that took place at the end of 2017 translated to a serious decline in the amount of capital being thrown around the cryptocurrency space: “since the crypto winter, companies have had a lot [fewer] funds to spend on media and crypto media readership has also been down, meaning that there has generally been a lot less money to go around.”

As such, “a lot of crypto media companies died during the crypto winter because they were unprofitable,’ Tatibouet said. “Those who survived were the ones who got creative. Crypto media started turning to more digital ways to increase revenue: banner ads & digital services.”

Tatibouet says that ultimately, this was a positive thing: “this brought more transparency to the industry, and smart companies like Coindesk or BTC Magazine have put down very firm lines in between the sales and editorial teams so as to preserve their integrity.”

”The standard for newsworthiness has increased substantially.”

David Wachsman, CEO of Wachsman, one of the world’s largest communications firms focusing on the blockchain industry, has also noted a marked improvement in the quality of journalism within the blockchain space since the crypto winter: “the reporters who remained after the most recent crypto bear market have a much deeper well of knowledge and therefore tend to write even better stories,” he told Finance Magnates.

“Also, the standard for newsworthiness has increased substantially — you have to pass an awfully challenging test to earn coverage. We see this as a signal of a maturing market.”

Additionally, “because blockchain technology can at times be complicated and industry fast-moving, reporters in the space usually have to achieve a certain level of prerequisite knowledge of the landscape before being able to dive into a story”; therefore, journalists who have managed to survive within the blockchain industry so far tend to be more informed about the things that they cover.

But Wachsman also noted that the slimming-down of the crypto media during the crypto winter has not been a totally positive thing for the industry: “some terrific news sites devoted to the industry have had to shut down consequently, and that has been a terrible loss for the blockchain space.”

Events, data have become a popular way for crypto media sites to profit

As readership and capital are becoming more and more difficult for crypto media sites to obtain, organizing corporate events has become an increasingly popular way of bringing in capital: CoinDesk’s Consensus has become extremely popular; CoinTelegraph is jumping into the game with Blockshow. Finance Magnates hosts a number of events of its own, including the Barcelona Trading Conference that took place in July of this year, and the upcoming London Summit that will take place this November.

“Events have also constituted a large part of [crypto media sites’] income during the boom of 2017, due to many companies using conferences as a platform to raise awareness for ICOs and funding rounds,” explained William McCormick, Founder of Pure Knot, a strategic communications and PR agency for blockchain companies, to Finance Magnates.

However, the industry is only so big: “events became extremely saturated, and newer events are noticing a significant decrease in attendance. The larger established events like Consensys NYC and San Francisco Blockchain Week are still going strong.’

“This is due to their reputation, and also to their approach in spreading these events over a week-long community gathering in each city’s financial and tech hubs. We are seeing this trend globally, with Japan blockchain week coming up soon, and many other countries holding their own Consensys style ‘week of crypto events.’”

McCormick also mentioned the importance of good data. “There is an increasing trend for publications to paywall their more detailed research or specific topics, based on the analytics and data they gather through their publication,” he said.

“Also as part of a growing trend, Binance, a leading crypto exchange, for example, made a strategic investment into the Chinese crypto-data website Mars Finance, joining the funding round that valued them $200M. It’s blockchain data could potentially be an effective resource for Binance to expand its reach in Asia.”

Solid SEO strategy is key in the cryptosphere

Because there is less money flying around in the media side of the cryptosphere than in 2017, the sites that have managed to survive have had to rely more heavily on search engine optimization (SEO) strategy in order to stay ahead of the competition.

“SEO still remains a cornerstone for successful crypto businesses who invest their time to do it properly. While Google’s algorithms have changed in favor of sites with SSL, mobile first and other changes, companies who do it well have been able to position themselves against their competitors,” McCormick explained.

“For those who’ve invested in localization as well, this can help them get discovered in all of the non-English versions of Google, as well as other search engines such as Yandex, Bing, and DuckDuckGo,” he added. Of all of the most popular crypto media sites, CoinTelegraph seems to be the one that has put the most effort into developing localized content: in addition to its English news site, the publication also has sites in Spanish, Japanese, and German.

In any case, SEO is key: “depending on what sector of crypto business operates in, strong SEO can make the difference between acquiring users at a modest cost, versus having to pay large amounts through advertising to compensate for weaknesses.”

One important aspect of this is domain names: “if we are looking at just the domain name alone, it is undeniable that you want people to recognize your brand, your business or what your website is all about,” reads a post from the aptly-named Website.com. “An SEO-optimized domain name is one that tells people what the website is about, the products and services it offers, etc.”

Crypto-related domain names are a hot commodity

As such, the battle over cryptocurrency domain names has ensued–cryptocurrency-related domain names have begun to fetch particularly high premiums in the online world. In 2018, Crypto.com sold for a whopping $12 million; at one point, Ethereum.com (which has no relation to the creators of Ethereum or any aspect of the technology itself) was on sale for $10 million. Now, a visit to the website bears a brief statement and an invitation for potential buyers to “Inquire.”

Even “lesser” domain names will fetch a pretty penny–for example, a quick search on GoDaddy’s domain value calculator revealed that “Bitcoin.cloud” was worth nearly €60,000; “Bitcoin.global” was worth nearly €5000. “Bitcoin.love” was a bargain for just €135.43.

The increased demand for cryptocurrency-related domain names has attracted a growing number of so-called “domain squatters” to the space: companies and individuals who buy up large amounts of cryptocurrency-related domain names in the hope that a crypto company will be interested in paying a premium for it at some point down the road.

But having crypto-related domain names is not the be-all and end-all for SEO in the cryptosphere–for example, CoinTelegraph acquired CT.com in October of last year, and paid heavily for it: although the exact price of the purchase is unknown, NamePros reported that “it looks as though MediaOptions was brokering the sale of this name in 2017 after it appeared on several newsletters, with the price on February 16th, 2017 quoted at $1.3 million.”

Because two-letter .com domain names are such a rarity (there are no more than 676 of them in existence), they can fetch a particularly high premium; in 2013, IG Group purchased IG.com for roughly $4.7 million. Other notable two-letter domain sales include $8 million for “WE.com,” $5 million for “JD.com,” and $3.2 million for “MI.com.”

CT.com is also over twenty years old. While the exact impact of domain age on search engine optimization (SEO) is unknown, the consensus among experts seems to be that the older a domain is, the more likely it is to rank highly in Google searches.

Traffic doesn’t lie

CoinTelegraph is certainly doing something right; the site is largely regarded as one of the most reliable news sources in the sphere. Additionally, India-based crypto journalist and digital marketing consultant Akshay Makadiya told Finance Magnates that “in terms of traffic, Cointelegraph leads the board followed by CoinDesk and Bitcoin.com,” he said.

“According to the data from Similarweb, the multilingual sub-domains by CoinTelegraph helps them to gain approx 6 million unique visitors a month. while CoinDesk [receives] 5 million unique visitors and Bitcoin.com receive approx 3.5 million visitors a month.”

On Sept. 27, in a letter addressed to European parliament member Eva Kaili, European Central Bank president Mario Draghi noted that the European System of Central Banks is closely monitoring developments in the cryptocurrency industry. Despite displaying a positive approach to new technologies, Draghi apparently thinks that stablecoins and cryptocurrency in general are not yet a substitute for fiat currency.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-story-behind-the-explosive-growth-of-crypto-funds,"The explosive growth of crypto funds is a compelling story, especially when you consider that the concept has only been around for six years. Today, crypto funds have become the engine powering the thriving crypto industry. Compared to the 224 funds launched in 2017, 2018 showed unprecedented growth as 239 new crypto funds entered the fray.

However, many have projected that the number will drop in 2019. Yet, according to proprietary research by Crypto Fund Research, there are reasons to believe that the crypto fund industry will continue to make strides, even as the crypto market recovers from a grueling bearish run.

As expected, the rise of crypto funds has directly impacted the crypto space, with several talking points trailing its emergence as a crucial part of the crypto economy.

Crypto funds are typically crypto hedge funds or venture capital funds

According to the same research, the 812 crypto funds presently operating across the world comprises of 369 crypto hedge funds and 421 venture capital funds, while the remaining are either crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or private equity funds. One could argue that the influx of venture capitalist funds has translated to more funding options for blockchain startups, as it is now a common trend for traditional VC firms to launch blockchain funds.

While this is a given, the growing and maturing blockchain/crypto landscape has attracted private equity funds to crypto investment funds. On the part of crypto hedge funds, it’s a matter of maximizing all the investment opportunities made available by the volatile nature of the crypto market. And so, they mostly function as hybrid funds that invest in Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies. As such, they employ long-term investment strategies with longer lockup periods — similar to how venture capitalists operate.

Crypto funds are not as big as their traditional counterpart

Although crypto funds are on the rise, a PwC and Elwood joint 2019 report shows that over 60% of existing crypto funds have assets under management (AUM) that is less than $10 million. Therefore, this means that many crypto funds are small-scale firms with fewer than five employees. However, top crypto funds which have more than $50 million in AUM do exist, and only two funds have AUM that is worth $1 billion and above.

As impressive as these stats are, they do not even come close to the value of assets that traditional hedge funds control. All crypto fund assets combined represent a meager 1% of hedge funds assets.

Crypto funds outperform Bitcoin

It is not every day you see hedge funds outperforming their benchmarks. A reality that holds in the traditional asset markets is redundant in the digital assets market, as crypto funds continue to perform beyond expectations. The Crypto Fund Research Cryptocurrency Fund Index (CFR Crypto index), which tracks over 40 crypto funds, managed to outperform the 100% increase experienced in the Bitcoin market from January 2017 to June 2019, gaining more than 1400% during the same period.

Related: Biggest Crypto Hedge Funds and What They Tell About the Market

The data from CFR Crypto index is more impressive when considering that crypto funds lagged behind many of the single digital assets performance in 2017 and overtook the market at a time when many feared the worst — the bear market. Nonetheless, this does not mean that investors did not lose money, rather that crypto funds returning -46% in 2018 compared to the -76% return of Bitcoin is, in itself, a success.

Crypto funds and bear market

The gruesome effect of 2018’s bear market — after the leading cryptocurrency’s price hit record highs at around $20,000 per coin — would have crippled the development of the crypto space if not for the unwavering optimism of crypto funds. Venture capitalists and crypto hedge funds utilized this period to pick out interesting blockchain projects and fund them. There is no doubt that without this funding, developments would have stalled.

Experience is one factor that should determine the profitability of investment funds, right? This belief is less potent in the hedge fund industry according to a recent Loyola Marymount University (LMU) report showing that hedge funds’ performance dipped as they aged. The research stated that the average age of conventional hedge funds is 52 months, and returns in the first year of operation are more than triple that of the fifth year. For crypto funds in the CFR index, their median age is 16 months. Applying the information garnered in the LMU report, one could argue that crypto fund managers are currently in their prime, and this has helped them generate fantastic returns.

America is still home to a large percentage of crypto funds

According to PwC and Elwood’s joint 2019 crypto fund report, 64% of crypto funds are based in the United States. Other countries that boast a booming crypto fund space are the Cayman Island, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Australia. It seems that crypto funds generally prefer cities, which house traditional hedge funds.

In the past, the small size of many crypto funds excluded them from the spotlight. However, things are changing, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies across the world are establishing guidelines for ICOs and security tokens. And since crypto hedge funds are heavily linked with security tokens, it is looking more likely that they will be required to meet stiffer registration requirements. A telling factor is the case of Pantera Capital, which disclosed in December 2018 that it might pay refunds and fines for investing in ICOs that violate U.S. securities laws.

A typical cryptocurrency fund could either be a hedge fund or a venture capital fund. Meanwhile, crypto funds are not as big as their traditional counterparts and are not so significant yet in the financial market. Nonetheless, on average, crypto hedge funds outperform Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency in the world. Crypto funds did good work in the bear market as the industry’s inexperience continues to propel its impressive run. To a large percentage of the world’s crypto funds, the U.S. remains to be home, and so, the regulatory uncertainties of this region is still a major talking point that needs to be clarified for future improvements of the industry.

The overwhelming majority of the population is familiar with Bitcoin and other crypto-assets.

The country now boasts a highly tech-savvy generation who are constantly on the lookout for new growth opportunities.

According to a survey by Bitcoin trading platform Paxful, 80% of Colombians are open to investing in cryptocurrency. Many young people are already used to trading digital coins. In fact, almost half of the people surveyed between 25 and 40 years old own cryptocurrencies or plan to buy some soon.

In 2019, Paxful alone has seen over $1 million in transactions from Colombian users.

Cryptocurrency in Colombia is popular

Many cryptocurrencies in South America are thriving as people look for alternative ways to counter inflation. This isn’t necessarily the case in Colombia however, since the inflation rate has been pretty stable this year. After surpassing the 7% milestone in 2016, the inflation rate has since come back down to lower values, recently reaching 3.42%.

While 3.42% may still seem high for stable economies, that’s a low rate for South America. So, inflation alone isn’t driving Colombian people towards cryptocurrencies.

Colombia’s case is different. The country has a recovering economy, and the population is open to new opportunities, such as cryptocurrency and fintech start-ups. In 2018, Bogotá ranked seventh in the list of top Bitcoin cities, with 87 active crypto businesses.

Colombian authorities haven’t provided a legal framework for the crypto ecosystem to fully develop yet, but the population continues to invest in digital assets.

The popularity of cryptocurrency in Colombia may also be a result of people’s reluctance to engage in traditional banking. As in most countries in Latin America, a significant part of the country’s population is “unbanked”. Many people don’t trust banks, don’t have a savings account, or simply prefer peer-to-peer alternatives for investing.

Story continues

Blockchain technology is also becoming more popular, as more organisations begin to implement pilot projects. The Colombian government is taking a welcoming approach to technology, and local and central authorities are also ready to implement blockchain solutions to solve their problems.

Venezuelans in Colombia opt for cryptocurrency

Another factor that may have changed the cryptocurrency habits in Colombia comes from other countries on the continent.

Colombia has received almost 1.4 million Venezuelan refugees over the past few years. Refugees have significantly contributed to the adoption of cryptocurrency in Colombia.

Venezuelans come from a country facing a severe economic and humanitarian crisis. Its government has experimented with the oil-backed cryptocurrency Petro, and Bitcoin and Dash are being used as both stores of value and payment methods.

Many people from Venezuela are familiar with the benefits of using cryptocurrencies and they continue to use them even after reaching Colombia – for sending money back home, for example.

Preference for Bitcoin

South America seems to have developed a passion for Bitcoin, and Colombia is no exception. The Paxful report showed that 79% of locals preferred using Bitcoin to preserve their cash, followed by a great distance by Bytecoin, Ether, and other cryptocurrencies.

Why Bitcoin? Besides the fact that everyone has heard about it, another reason may be the wide acceptance of this digital currency. Bitcoin is already an accepted form of payment for online shopping at many businesses.

Moreover, many financial institutions and tech start-ups also rely on Bitcoin when developing crypto-products.

Bitcoin ATMs are thriving as well

People buy most cryptocurrency in Colombia either on peer-to-peer exchange platforms or directly from Bitcoin ATMs. As a general rule, the less they have to deal with third-party financial institutions, the better.

Among the most trusted cryptocurrency exchanges in Colombia are LocalBitcoins, Binance, and Kraken. Locals also seem to have a preference for platforms that allow users to buy cryptocurrency anonymously, such as Paxful or Coinmama.

Moreover, the Bitcoin ATM market has been growing. Colombia hosts 54 Bitcoin ATM installations spread across the entire country. The highest concentration of machines is in Bogotà, with 32 ATMs, and Medellin, where people have access to 11 devices.

Besides Bitcoin, most of the ATMs also sell Bitcoin Cash, Ether, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Zcash, and Dogecoin. Colombia has the most Bitcoin ATMs out of any Latin American country and currently ranks ninth in the world for Bitcoin ATMs.

Final thoughts

Colombia is a country with an appetite for innovation and blockchain-driven progress. Cryptocurrency adoption is on the rise, as well as blockchain-based projects that are meant to boost growth in this recovering economy.

A massive majority of the population has heard about cryptocurrencies, and most people are open to investing in digital coins. Young people take the lead when it comes to cryptocurrency adoption, and the country offers considerable potential for crypto-related companies.

The post What are the cryptocurrency habits in Colombia? appeared first on Coin Rivet.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/government-of-uzbekistan-triples-tax-on-electricity-for-crypto-miners,"The government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has ordered a 300% increase on electricity tariffs for cryptocurrency miners.

According to a Sept. 27 announcement, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan has decreed that cryptocurrency miners must pay three times more the existing electricity tariffs.

The provision follows an Aug. 22, 2019 decree from President Shavkat Mirziyoyev entitled “On Accelerated Measures to Improve Energy Efficiency of Economic Sectors and the Social Sphere, Implement Energy Saving Technologies and Develop Renewable Energy Sources” and to further motivate the rational use of electrical energy by consumers.

Uzbekistan’s approach to crypto and blockchain

Last September, Mirziyoyev ordered the establishment of a state blockchain development fund called the ""Digital Trust."" The fund's primary goal is to integrate blockchain into various government projects, including healthcare, education and cultural areas. The organization is set to be responsible for international investment in the Uzbek digital economy.

Earlier the same month, a decree legalizing crypto trading — also making it tax-free — and mining in the country came into force. According to the law, foreign nationals can only trade cryptocurrencies in Uzbekistan by creating a subsidiary in the country.

The law also specifies a minimum capital requirement of roughly $710,000 to establish a crypto exchange. Furthermore, crypto traders will not fall under Uzbek stock market regulations and will be relieved of their obligation to pay taxes on trading revenues.

Mining regulation in other countries

In June, the Iranian government announced that they would cut power to crypto mining operations until new energy prices were approved. Iran’s Ministry of Energy reportedly revealed that the country had seen a 7% spike of electricity consumption over a monthly period ending on June 21, 2019. The Ministry believes that the surge was caused by the growing number of crypto mining activities in the country.

China’s Bitcoin mining scene is a major player in the global hash rate, with China-based mining pools reportedly mining potentially 70% of all the coins created yearly. However, in April, the Chinese government said that it was considering the elimination of crypto mining in the country.",,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/28/1922142/0/en/BitHarp-Brings-a-New-Way-of-Mining-Cryptocurrencies.html,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand, Sept. 28, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The rapidly evolving global market for cryptocurrency is currently abuzz with the recent introduction of two extraordinarily designed mining rigs, Lyre Miner and Harp Miner from BitHarp Group Limited ( www.bitharp.com ). Instead of focusing only on highly proficient and technology savvy mining stalwarts, these two products were created to allow the casual enthusiasts as well as small-time miners to make their fortune out of crypto mining.



Over the years, cryptocurrency mining has seen serious improvements. However, owing to the highly technical nature of this domain, it had limited to no scope for people that are technologically challenged. BitHarp has already changed that perception by creating two rigs that are pre-configured and just needs to be plugged-in for an uncomplicated crypto mining experience.

Within less than a month in the market, Lyre Miner and Harp Miner have been used by many common users without any technical background to earn healthy returns on their investment. This has been made possible by the extraordinary hash power offered by the products. Also, with low energy-consumptions of 600W and 2400 W respectively, Lyre Miner and Harp Miner are now amongst the most energy-efficient mining hardware in the market.

Lyre Miner and Harp Miner can be used for mining Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Dash with the following hash powers.

Lyre Miner: 335 TH/s for Bitcoin, 55 GH/s for Litecoin, 14 GH/s for Ethereum, and 9 TH/s for Dash

Harp Miner: 2000 TH/s for Bitcoin 300 GH/s for Litecoin, 75 GH/s for Ethereum, and 50 TH/s for Dash

The miners from BitHarp are suitable for use at home because they generate low amounts of heat as well as noise. Moreover, unlike hundreds of products in the market, Lyre Miner and Harp Miner do not need a huge space. BitHarp is currently running a 3 plus 1 one promotional campaign for both their products that will conclude on October 2.

Of course, the journey has just begun, and it is riddled with potholes, traps and a high level of resistance.

The extent of the crypto revolution is total, disruptive, world-wide and irreversible. But its final destination is pretty neat: a screenshot of an average day on planet Earth by 2050 shows clearly showing human beings using a financial commodity called “cryptocurrency” through physical wallets residing on their smartphones and connecting everyone directly through a solid and shared ecosystem that is backed by traditional financial institutions (i.e., banks). The output will cast aside the old, centralized and controlled fiat system for a new, cheaper, decentralized, easier and faster structure, able to potentially connect everyone.

Try to remember how socializing was before the arrival of Facebook and other social networks, and you will have a fresh feeling of crypto’s potential reach. The world as we know it will never be the same.

The speculative sin

A few frictions are lagging crypto’s mass adoption process. The first one is certainly the financial speculation rooted to the early days and still thriving to this day. Financial speculation is an ideal way to make a large quantity of money in a short period of time, but in a high-risk environment and at the expense of somebody else. It remains an attractive option for speculative large traders, who will do anything in their power to maintain the crypto market’s current conditions, with major coins able to rise or fall by 1,800% in less than one year, as they did in 2017 when the leading cryptocurrency’s price hit record highs at around $20,000 per coin.

But speculation is not the reason for which crypto was created. As perfectly outlined by Marc Andreessen, co-creator of two of the internet’s first browsers, Mosaic and Netscape, who outlined: “This is the distributed trust network that the Internet always needed and never had.” Or, to say it like Don and Alex Tapscott in their brilliant book, “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World,” cryptocurrencies are based on a new technology — blockchain — that is a “protocol that enables mere mortals to manufacture trust through clever code.” Don and Alex write:

“They have been created to ensure trusted transactions directly between two or more parties, authenticated by mass collaboration and powered by collective self-interests, rather than by large corporations motivated by profit.”

In other words, crypto is intended to make currency transactions easy, cheap, sure, fast and available for everyone — and not to speculate on! And, most importantly, to be used and not merely stored somewhere.

Traditional and crypto financial markets

The inclination is progressively torn by traditional financial institutions like banks. From one side, they are fiercely struggling against the crypto world, but from the other side, and under the deepest silence, they are fighting key positions. They are painfully following the era of crypto, aware that sooner or later it will become massive, yet slowing it down while occupying as much space in the industry as possible in preparation for the moment when large adoption comes about.

Related: What Does Mass Adoption Mean Relating to Crypto? Experts Answer

The market is becoming increasingly regulated, with the launch of derivative instruments by some of the more well-known and reliable exchanges, indexes and cryptocurrency lenders, while from the other end, institutional investors, financial public bodies and traditional investment funds are coming out of the woodwork.

Unfortunately, my analysis shows that the speculative phase is hard to die, as it is a fantastic opportunity for specialized traders to make a huge quantity of money in a very short time. That means a very dense resistance to changes, pulling in the opposite direction to where the crypto area is moving.

The role of the traditional banking system

The relationship between the bank system and the crypto environment is vague and heavy with conflict. The crypto ecosystem is potentially in a position to snap a good chunk from the bank. But from another perspective, the bank system is sitting on an astronomic market cap, is managing a breathtakingly high stockpile of financial assets, and is used by billions and backed by almost all governments. It’s a David and Goliath story.

As the recent history of Bitcoin (BTC) invention has clearly taught us, all digital revolutions coming from the people are unstoppable. Bottom line: the powers that be can slow it down but they cannot stop it. And the strategy of the banking system is coming out: Make things hard for crypto during daylight, but work under the surface at night to grab as many positions as possible in the crypto area in order to control and occupy the space.

The final destination

From financial speculation to a stabilized financial market to finally becoming a financial commodity used by all. The point of arrival is probably the secret dream of the founders of the first cryptocurrency ever: to democratize and provide humanity access to a smarter, cheaper, decentralized and not-controlled means to exchange value between individuals, corporations and public bodies.

Related: Should Crypto Stay Decentralized or Are CBDCs Better? Experts Answer

As a recent survey shows, the average person at present doesn’t have any idea how to buy, sell or use cryptocurrencies. The majority of people don’t have the necessary skills to understand what an exchange is, how an external wallet works, or how to figure out all the needed technicalities to trade and store the most common cryptocurrencies. To them, the crypto area is still an unknown and scary world to be suspicious about.

Yet leverage and margin trading, in general, can help “turbo-charge” demand for an asset. They can also free up capital, thus increasing liquidity within a given market as traders look to use their capital elsewhere.

It’s an investment strategy of using borrowed money for the use of various financial tools to increase the potential return of an investment.

It’s also an efficient use of trading capital, valued by professionals because it allows them to trade large positions without committing 100 percent of their capital to a risky spot position.

For example, a trader that wanted to buy a thousand tokens at $1 apiece would only require a $100 of trading capital, depending on the leverage used, thereby leaving the remaining $900 available for additional trades.

Why leverage matters for bitcoin

Often touted as the most liquid cryptocurrency asset available, BTC benefits from leverage and margin trading activity by allowing investors and traders to lock in a position while maintaining a portfolio of other cryptos. It also provides professionals and retail investors with additional tools to capture value in the crypto market. In effect, greater demand on the asset class vastly improves the potential for more accurate value capture through organic price discovery.

Participating in a live panel discussion at Invest: ASIA in Singapore, Lennix Lai, financial market director at OKEx told Coindesk:

“If you can only buy or sell particular underlying tokens of bitcoin and you don’t have the capability to short, basically speculate in another direction, then the market would be a lot more volatile because it would be entirely driven by sentiment.”

“For example, you can view bitcoin as being much more volatile before CME Futures were introduced … so we should have more financial instruments like options to assist further in the price discovery process in relation to volatility,” he said.

Greater access to capital means greater liquidity, without actually increasing the number of traders in a given market. It provides a means for increasing capital inflow without attracting any new money.

And while the total market capitalization of the crypto market has been on the slide alongside declining total volume, the pressures from a bear market can be offset through leverage and margin trading.

What’s the risk?

Of course, the rewards don’t come without inherent risks, as a loss can lead to the liquidation of a trader’s capital and force spot prices lower. Such an event recently took place in BTC’s futures market on Sept. 24 triggering a “long squeeze“.

If the cryptocurrency underlying a trade moves in the opposite direction to what was expected, leverage can greatly amplify the potential losses. To manage the risk associated, traders usually implement a strict trading style that includes the use of stop orders and limit orders designed to curb potential losses.

Also speaking on the panel in Singapore, Sunny Ray, head of global business development at the Kraken crypto exchange, explained how exchanges protect themselves from that risk:

“If there’s a lot of volatility in the market, if the value of the asset drops below 20 or 30 percent, there is something called a margin call that takes place where a company will actually liquidate the customer’s assets to cover some of those losses.”

There are currently eight major exchanges that offer the ability to leverage crypto, with several others offering margin trading accounts such as Kraken, Binance and Deribitm, while Bakkt’s release of its futures product on Sept. 23 adds to the opportunities for more authentic price discoveries.

IOHK has announced a strategic partnership with the global athletic brand New Balance to use the Cardano (ADA) blockchain to authenticate its range of premium sneakers.

Beginning as a pilot, the plan is to roll the program out worldwide. There are no plans to use the ADA token for this specific solution.

New Balance is one of the world’s leading brands in athletic footwear. Based in Boston Massachusetts, the company has expanded dramatically over the past five years, doubling its staff to more than 8,000 worldwide, with revenue increasing from $2.7bn in 2013 to $4.1bn last year.

New Balance has complained about the number of ‘parasite brands’ that have copied their image and branding. The company has been heading a strategy to lessen the damaging impact, which has included better engagement with regulators.

A Chinese court awarded New Balance $1.5bn in copyright damages in 2017, finding that a local company selling shoes under the name of ‘New Boom’ had copied New Balance’s logo. They ruled that it would be very easy for purchasers to think they were authentic.

IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson announced the new collaboration at the Cardano Summit Bulgaria earlier on Saturday. It is a consumer-level verification solution that is designed specifically for the secondary market, allowing purchasers to confirm the authenticity of the footwear using Cardano’s distributed ledger.

New Balance has been the official kitwear supplier to the premier league’s Liverpool FC.

Companies have already begun experimenting with distributed ledger technology in their supply chains. VeChain’s entire model rests on allowing interested parties to monitor goods as they cross global supply chains. Back in early 2018, the French supermarket brand Carrefour said it was planning to use blockchain technology for a premium brand of chicken.

Blockchain has been used to help authenticate valued goods. There have been initiatives to protect the UK drinks industry from counterfeit goods, as well as to track and validate pharmaceuticals. Back in June, retail giant Walmart announced they would be joining a consortium to fight against fake drugs prevalent in the US.

Earlier this year, IOHK announced a new collaboration with the government of Ethiopia that would include the development of a new cryptocurrency that could be used as a secure and dependable means of payment.

Based on the ATALA framework, the idea is it could be used to pay for utilities as well as public transport in the nation’s capital of Adis Adaba. IOHK are also busy building a new traceability and tracking solution for foodstuffs moving across the country.

The pilot program is expected to go live very soon. A source familiar with the matter told Crypto Briefing that it is expected to go live in October.

An IOHK spokesperson declined to comment on when the partnership would go live.",2019-09-28 14:56:17+00:00

Top Stories This Week

It’s been a week to forget in the crypto world. Bitcoin (BTC) prices crashed hard on Tuesday — rapidly dropping from $9,800 to $8,150 over the course of the day. The double-digit percentage losses saw the overall crypto market cap lose a whopping $20 billion in less than an hour. While some analysts blamed Bakkt’s sluggish launch for the downturn, others said BTC’s weak market moves may be linked to the political turmoil in the United States, where news of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump spooked markets. Altcoins were not immune from Tuesday’s pain — Bitcoin SV (BSV) took a massive hit of more than 34% on the day, while Ether (ETH) sustained heavy losses of 24%. Later in the week, BTC/USD dipped to $7,736 — the lowest price since May 2019. Although some ground was recovered, Bitcoin entered the weekend trading sideways in the low $8,000s.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to show a rare display of fear as regulatory scrutiny surrounding the Libra stablecoin intensifies. He admitted the project was “very sensitive for society” and said his company was determined to work through issues before launching. The billionaire also acknowledged this is a very different approach to what Facebook might have done five years ago. In other Libra news this week, reports emerged that the social network’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, is in talks to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee. Meanwhile, Calibra wallet head David Marcus — who has already faced a grilling in front of Congress — asserted in a blog post that blockchain-based payment networks can address inefficiencies in existing payment systems.

The CEO and founder of Kik, the Canadian social media and messaging app, had a defiant message for U.S. regulators this week: We’re not going down without a fight. The company has been mired in a costly legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the initial coin offering for its Kin cryptocurrency — with the SEC claiming the $100 million sale was unregistered. Kik’s CEO, Ted Livingston, told a conference in Toronto on Wednesday: “We have to keep going. Until that’s it, we don’t have a dollar left, a person left. We will keep going no matter how hard it is.” Also this week, Livingston confirmed that the company will shut down the Kik app and reduce its headcount from 151 to 19 as it fights for Kin’s survival. The embattled company is hoping to go to trial in May 2020 and is raising $5 million to fund its lawsuit against the SEC.

Paris Retail Week brought the news that support for BTC payments is going to be launched at more than 25,000 sales points for 30 French retailers next year. Big brands such as the sportswear giant Decathlon and cosmetics chain Sephora are among those involved in the project. Global POS, the company providing the technology, described it as an “important symbolic step in the evolution of payment methods in France” that will allow businesses to “safely enter the world of Economy 3.0.” Even as thousands of stores embrace crypto, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi continued to be pessimistic about the future of crypto assets — insisting they “are not designed in ways that make them suitable substitutes for money.” On Wednesday, a new survey by Big Four auditor KPMG suggested that 63% of U.S. customers perceive blockchain tokens to be an easy form of payment.

Justin Sun’s buffet with Buffett has been delayed for some time now. The Tron founder had paid $4.56 million for the privilege during a charity auction in June, but postponed due to medical reasons. Now, Sun is saying he plans to schedule his brunch with the billionaire “very soon” — and he even wants to add other esteemed individuals to the guest list. In a tweet to President Trump, a crypto skeptic, Sun wrote: “Mr. President, you are misled by fake news. #Bitcoin & #Blockchain happens to be the best chance for US! I'd love to invite you to have lunch with crypto leaders along with @WarrenBuffett on July 25. I guarantee you after this lunch, nobody will know crypto more than you!” He hasn’t had a reply yet.

Winners and Losers

At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $8,058.19, Ether at $167.93 and XRP at $0.24. The total market cap is at $213,108,859,392.

The top three altcoin gainers of the week are Custody Token, XTRD and Tellurion. The top three altcoin losers of the week are Pandacoin, Bitcoin God and Oxycoin.

“Bakkt, first day volumes: 71 bitcoin. CME, first day volumes: 5298 bitcoin. That's a 75x difference.” Alex Kruger, trader

Prediction of the Week

A cheery prediction of six-figure BTC prices somehow doesn’t seem appropriate this week. Gold bug Peter Schiff, who has never knowingly passed up an opportunity to bash Bitcoin, has a rather gloomy forecast for the world’s dominant cryptocurrency. After BTC shed $1,800 in a matter of hours, he warned: “The risk is high for a rapid descent to $4,000 or lower!”

FUD of the Week

Contradicting previous statements, the People’s Bank of China has now denied that Beijing is ready to launch its digital currency. The state-run Global Times said the delay is because the bank “needs to research, test, evaluate and prevent risks.” Back in August, Deputy Director Mu Changchun had suggested that the project was complete and awaiting launch — perhaps even before the end of 2020. Those comments had sparked suggestions that Beijing was in a race to beat Libra to the punch. With Facebook’s stablecoin bogged down in regulatory red tape, these latest remarks indicate the social network may have a little bit of breathing space.

We’ve seen some audacious scams in our times at CT Towers, but this one takes the cake. Fraudsters have sent out letters in the post to British consumers, posing as senior servants to the Queen, to ask for $2.5 million in BTC to help the United Kingdom maintain the local economy after Brexit. The letter says those who send cryptocurrency will be rewarded with a 30% interest rate for three months — as well as, get this, the honor of becoming a Member of the Royal Warrant Holders Association. Naturally, the letter includes a plea to keep this exclusive offer secret.

And here’s one more scam that’s worthy of a FUD mention this week. Scammers are using fake mainstream news articles to advertise a nonexistent and potentially dangerous Bitcoin investment platform. The ruse uses celebrity endorsements from the likes of actress Kate Winslet — and even boasts that it has backing from Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Bill Gates. The fraudsters claim that each star bought $10,394 worth of BTC and netted a return of $421,226 — a growth of 4,110% — in the space of a week. Winslet responded angrily to news that her image was used in this way, describing the promotion as “completely disingenuous and categorically false.”

Despite growing adoption, cryptocurrencies still face a number of challenges in Cuba, including limited access to crypto exchanges, lack of a pertinent regulatory apparatus and the growing popularity of a gold-backed MLM stablecoin.

10,000 Cubans use crypto

On Sept. 12, a report published by Reuters included excerpts from an interview with Jason Sanchez, a 35-year-old Cuban who describes virtual currencies as “opening new doors” for ordinary citizens. The Havana resident runs a cell phone repair shop and uses Bitcoin (BTC) to purchase hardware online from China.

According to members of CubaCripto, a Telegram group boasting 600 members and considered to be among the first crypto-oriented online communities in Cuba, cryptocurrencies are increasing in popularity for several utilities.

While the primary utility of cryptocurrencies cited is their capacity to allow Cubans to circumvent economic sanctions and make purchases online, other members of the local crypto community are looking to virtual currencies for trading and investment purposes, seeking to profit from Bitcoin price volatility.

Despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, some Cubans are also using crypto as a means to store value. Many of CubaCripto’s members also emphasize the privacy benefits to Bitcoin, highlighting that their financial activities are less easily traced by the local government.

Alex Sobrino, the founder of CubaCripto, estimates that 10,000 Cubans regularly use cryptocurrency. According to Alex, ordinary Cubans are using crypto to purchase phone credit, buy goods online, and even make hotel reservations.

Cubans blocked by crypto exchanges

While cryptocurrency is increasing in popularity across cryptocurrency in Cuba, the island’s residents are barred from accessing many virtual currency exchanges. As of July 1, 2019, Binance DEX’s website began to geoblock users with IP addresses originating from 29 countries, including Cuba.

During May 2018, Bittrex also updated its terms of service to formally block residents of Cuba alongside four other nations subject to U.S. sanctions. In July 2017, a programmer based in the United Kingdom visited Cuba and, upon arriving home, found that his Coinbase account had been blocked after having accessed the account while on the island.

In November 2018, a report published by Mosaic.io found that 19 of 44 cryptocurrency exchanges restricted Cubans from accessing their platform, making Cuba the sixth-most blocked jurisdiction by crypto exchanges, followed by the United States, which is blocked by 30 exchanges, Iran and North Korea with 24, Syria with 23 and Sudan with 20.

CubaCripto members report that there are no traditional exchanges facilitating virtual currency for Cuban fiat currency. As such, many Cubans seeking to purchase crypto must do so via direct face-to-face transactions with local traders in exchange for cash or phone credit.

Accessing crypto in Cuba

Fusyona, a company founded in 2018 seeking to bill itself as Cuba’s first cryptocurrency exchange, does not offer typical order-matching services. Instead, the company acts as a broker between cryptocurrency buyers and individuals located outside of the country who are seeking to remit funds to Cuba, charging a fee of up to 10 percent.

The founder of Fusyona, Adrian Leon, states that for citizens living in developed countries, virtual currencies are “just another option,” while for Cubans, cryptocurrencies comprise a needed solution to Cuba’s “exclusion from the global financial community.”

At the start of the year, Havana was struck by a devastating tornado that resulted in 3 deaths, 172 injuries and wholesale damage to local properties and infrastructure. Due to the financial embargo maintained against Cuba, GoFundMe and Facebook campaigns seeking to distribute aid to the island’s citizens were shut down.

In response, Fusyona launched a platform through which donations in the form of Bitcoin could be accepted and used to fund the provision of basic goods, including toiletries, water, canned food and powdered milk. The company also donated its profits to the platform during the campaign. Leon estimates that the platform currently has a user base of 1,300 — nearly double its previous count of 700 in July.

Cryptocurrencies are not regulated in Cuba

Despite the growing popularity of crypto in Cuba, no regulatory apparatus exists to legitimize the operations of businesses operating with cryptocurrencies on the island. Fusyona’s founder expressed concerns that his partners who receive and transfer cash might be suspected of engaging in illicit financial activities and has engaged Cuban Central Bank officials for regulatory approval. Due to the lack of regulatory architecture for crypto in Cuba, Fusyona is currently registered in Brazil.

Professor Alexi Masso Muoz of Havana University’s cryptography institute told Reuters that while no Cuban virtual currency laws currently exist, “it is possible” that the island may soon seek to develop crypto regulations. However, many Cubans fear the government may move to prohibit virtual currencies. On this, CubaCripto’s Alex Sobrino stated:

“We worry the government will restrict us, prohibit things, start to say this is illicit enrichment.”

Crypto gains momentum in Cuba during 2015

While last year’s roll-out of mobile internet was a catalyst for the recent growth in Cuban crypto adoption, virtual currencies have been slowly taking root in Cuba for at least four years following the introduction of public Wi-Fi networks in 2015.

During March 2015, CoinTelegraph interviewed members of Club Anarcocapitalista de Cuba (Cuban Anarchocapitalist Club, or CAC). The group is believed to have been the first entity to accept BTC payments in Cuba, starting from February 2015. The group’s co-founder, Jois Garcia, stated:

“We believe that Bitcoin has an essential role to play within the context of renewed relations between Cuba and the USA. This currency would not be punished like the dollar is today; the dictatorship makes holding dollars a burden, but the introduction of Bitcoin would allow us to potentially dodge this problem.”

Garcia was introduced to Bitcoin by Fernando Villar, a first-generation Cuban American based in New Jersey and the administrator of BitcoinCuba. At the time, Villar described the softening relations between Cuba and the U.S. as providing the catalyst for Bitcoin to “begin to flourish in Cuba,” highlighting that the presence of U.S. telecommunication infrastructure was improving “phone and internet services on the island.”

Despite his optimism regarding Bitcoin’s potential in Cuba, Villar acknowledged that the island’s cryptocurrency scene was in its nascent stages, stating that he was aware of only a single Cuban Bitcoin miner.

Despite the launch of public Wi-Fi, internet access was extremely expensive, with an hour of heavily-censored internet costing $4.50 — nearly 20% of the average Cuban wage at the time. While 37% of Cubans were estimated to have access to the internet in 2015, Freedomhouse found that less than 5% of the island’s residents had access to uncensored internet.

CAC co-founder Nelson Chartrand described the low rates of internet access as the principal barrier to Bitcoin adoption in Cuba during an interview with Vice in June 2015: “A lot of people in Cuba have never actually been online—that’s the big obstacle right now.”

When visiting Cuba during July 2015, Villar was involved in the first publicly executed Bitcoin transfers between Cuba and the United States. In an interview two months later, Villar spoke to the increasing penetration of communication technology in Cuba, stating that more Cubans owned “iPhones and Androids sent from families abroad than have bank accounts.”

Recent reports estimate that 1,400 WiFi hotspots are operational in Cuba, while 80,000 homes have internet access and 2.5 million Cubans have access to 3G mobile internet, the latter equating to nearly 22% of the population.

Gold-pegged stablecoin MLM emerges in Cuba

In addition to leading cryptocurrencies like BTC and Ethereum (ETH), the gold-pegged cryptocurrency and multi-level marketing scheme KaratGold Coin (KBC) is circulating Cuba.

According to a report published by PortalCuba.cu, the members of CubaCripto frequently discuss the price of gold and KBC, with users arguing over whether KBC is a “pyramid scam, multilevel company,” or a source of “residual income for life.” The report describes KBC alongside BTC, ETH and Litecoin (LTC) as among the most popular cryptocurrencies in Cuba.

Cuba explores state-backed Crypto

At the start of July 2019, Cuba’s government announced via state TV that it was exploring cryptocurrency among other economic measures as a means to boost production and bolster growth. President Miguel Diaz-Canel announced that the new economic measures would raise incomes for a quarter of Cuba’s citizens in addition to facilitating access to foreign investments and the circumvention of U.S. sanctions. Cuba’s economy minister, Alejandro Gil Fernandez, stated:

“We are studying the potential use of cryptocurrency [...] in our national and international commercial transactions, and we are working on that together with academics.”

Upon hearing of Cuba’s interest in blockchain technology, founder of McAfee and U.S. tax fugitive John McAfee, offered free assistance to the country in developing a virtual currency. In one interview, McAfee stated that creating a coin that is tailored to the economic needs of the country is not an easy task and that he is one of the very few people who can make it happen. Speaking to Cointelegraph while residing in Cuba, McAfee stated:

“Keep in mind Cuba is a very unique country. It’s the only communist country in the Caribbean area — the closest communist country to America. Cryptocurrency has had very little impact on the economy here, on the people. And very few people understand it or know anything about it.”

According to state-backed website Cubadebate.cu, the Central Bank of Cuba is currently examining the risks and benefits associated with virtual currencies.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-crypto-gambling-is-regulated-around-the-world,"The Japanese House of Representatives recently passed new crypto asset regulation affecting exchanges and custodians — the Payment Services Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. However, the country’s crypto gambling industry still endures strict gambling regulations.

“Japan has very strict rules regarding gambling and the same applies to crypto gambling,” Joseph D. Hugh, CFO of international cryptocurrency betting platform Jukebucks, told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Although it is very difficult to restrict players who play, the government keeps a close tab on crypto transactions originating from Japan using taxation as an excuse.”

Yet, Japan passed a federal law in July 2018 that allows physical casinos in the country: “Japan is opening up its offline casino license to major players after next year’s Olympics,” Hugh pointed out, “It is uncertain who will receive licenses for Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa and Hokkaido. We believe online casinos will follow only after offline casinos start operation.”

Japan’s approval of “integrated resorts” has yet to be felt by the cryptocurrency industry. An integrated resort is a comprehensive entertainment complex with casinos, shopping malls, theaters, hotels and theme parks. While Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has introduced such pro-casino legislation as part of his overall growth strategy, Japan has not been so welcoming of crypto gambling.

Crypto gambling in Japan

Cryptocurrency gambling in Japan isn’t as prevalent as one would think given the country’s track record of implementing cryptocurrency regulations early, which is perhaps due to its experience with the collapse of Mt. Gox, a Japanese-based crypto exchange that went bankrupt in 2014.

Early in 2019, Blockchain network Tron, which claims to be building the infrastructure for a truly decentralized internet, blocked gambling apps on its decentralized app (dapp) store in Japan following pressure from Japanese regulators.

Tron proactively blocking access to certain dapps led Tron’s Chief Technology Office (CTO) and co-founder Lucien Chen to leave the team. He cited the inconsistency between Tron’s dedication to being decentralized and its actions, which Chen said were more inherent to those of a centralized entity.

How does cryptocurrency gambling work?

Blockchain-based gambling, for the most part, takes place in two ways: on-chain and off-chain.

Off-chain cryptocurrency gambling involves physical and online casinos accepting cryptocurrency, mostly Bitcoin (BTC), as a deposit method into an internet casino account.

These establishments will often use a third-party custodian, such as BitPay, to convert Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency to a local fiat currency. There are online casinos that purely operate without fiat denominations, though, and pay out in Bitcoin.

On-chain gambling occurs on a blockchain via smart contracts that comprise a decentralized application (Dapp), which has a backend code running on a blockchain network instead of traditional centralized servers.

It is much easier for governments to go after off-chain casinos. Crypto gambling website casinos often ban IP addresses, preventing access from certain countries. When attempting to use on Bitcoin-accepting gaming sites from within the United States, the users will most likely be blocked.

On-chain casinos and other more decentralized or distributed methods of online gambling are not entirely immune to the effects of government regulation either, as we’ve seen with Tron’s refusal to show gambling dapps to Japanese users, as reported by Cointelegraph. Japanese internet users, however, can use a VPN to access Tron’s gambling dapps or blocked dapps from anywhere. Cryptocurrency gambling indeed remains a topic of hot debate in Japan. Nevertheless, no official guidelines have been put into place yet.

A global snapshot of crypto gambling regulation



While most countries have official regulations in place regarding online gambling, only a handful of nations regulate crypto gambling.They include the United Kingdom, Italy, The Netherlands, Greece, Poland and Belgium.

In many countries, Bitcoin is not considered a legal payment method under existing guidelines, so therefore shouldn’t be used in gambling. More clarity on that matter is evidently needed in various countries. Japan is perhaps the most notable example, where the gambling industry exceeds that of Nevada by over $4 billion and is estimated to be $15.8 billion.

In the U.K., numerous online gambling platforms and service providers accept cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency-oriented service providers must adhere to the existing gambling laws active in the United Kingdom. There, sports betting is an extremely popular activity, having grown into a 700-million-GBP industry. Several crypto-focused sports betting websites can also be found online.

While the U.K. Gambling Commission allows Bitcoin gambling, it also issued a warning on its website against untrustworthy service providers. Users are advised to “be cautious when using Bitcoin due to the associated risks.”

Yet, the benefits provided to gamblers by cryptocurrencies cannot be overlooked. Bitcoin provides a degree of privacy, though not anonymity. No personal information is transmitted when conducting a Bitcoin transaction, but a person attempting to convert BTC to fiat must be identified in most countries through know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering procedures (AML).

On the other hand, privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) give their users a greater amount of identity protection and, although less widely-accepted than Bitcoin, are known to be an impediment to law enforcement’s investigative abilities. Joseph Hugh believes that tighter crypto regulations will help those using the digital currency for legal purposes:

“It is the role of all governments to try to regulate any and all financial activities of its citizens and nobody can blame them except for people who are in the grey and fishy businesses. I strongly believe that dapps are here to stay as country boundaries cannot stop people from getting around to them eventually.”

Despite the numerous regulatory and technical challenges faced by successful adoption in casinos, the world’s gambling industry is becoming increasingly friendly to cryptocurrency. Online casinos and even well-known Las Vegas establishments are starting to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which is a trend that we will likely continue seeing in the future.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/international-crypto-exchange-luno-adds-bitcoin-cash-trading/,"International Crypto Exchange Luno Adds Bitcoin Cash Trading

Luno Adds Bitcoin Cash Trading

Luno, the London-headquartered company formerly known as Bitx, recently announced that bitcoin cash was made available on its cryptocurrency exchange. Starting from Monday, September 23, customers at Luno are now able to store, buy and sell BCH on the platform. The reason given for adding BCH to the exchange is feedback from users in developing markets that convinced Luno to expand their offering from previously just BTC and ETH.

Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of Luno, said, “We are in a new and exciting financial era. Developing economies are leading the large-scale adoption and application of cryptocurrencies. Luno has been part of this change and has listened to, and always worked hard to understand the needs of these developing economies. It is for this reason we have moved to expand our offering of secure and legitimate digital currencies to individuals, enabling cross-functional accessibility and transfer of funds.”

Available in 40 Countries Around the World

The Luno team promised their clients that the offering will continue to expand after the addition of bitcoin cash, with new digital assets to trade on the platform. However, they also assured users that safety will continue to come first and explained that any new coins added to the platform will have been monitored by the company for several years, having the credibility to make it onto one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges.

Marius Reitz, General Manager Africa for Luno, commented, “There are over 2,000 cryptocurrencies in the market and we take our role as a trusted platform very seriously. We are therefore very cautious about new coins. We only add new coins once we are confident of their security, credibility, and market traction.”

The company claims to have around 3 million users worldwide, spread across 40 countries. Luno also has local offices in South Africa, Indonesia, Nigeria, Singapore and Malaysia, with a workforce of over 300 employees around the world.

If the platform you are using does not support bitcoin cash, besides convincing the company to do so, you can purchase it directly at buy.Bitcoin.com, buy it from peer-to-peer traders at local.Bitcoin.com, or simply join exchange.Bitcoin.com.

“I think what was missing in the crypto market is a lot of very solid traditional types of products, but with crypto assets,” Ben Tsai, managing partner of Wave Financial, told CoinDesk.

After several months of due diligence, Tsai said Fidelity Digital Assets is now on board to provide custody for the fund.

The idea is to capture part of a new market of yield products in the crypto space, building on creativity from traditional funds and the growth of the crypto derivatives platforms that underpin the technical aspects of these new funds.

The Wave fund plans to generate monthly income with the premium from selling call options with strikes 20 percent higher than the current price at the time. It aims to distribute dividend that is 1.5 percent net asset value of the bitcoin held in the fund, potentially resulting in an 18 percent annual yield.

The bitcoin income fund charges 100 basis points fixed management annually, and takes 30 percent of any returns above the 18 percent yield, putting the rest back into the fund, according to Tsai.

The new fund is currently open for subscriptions, but there haven’t been any investors who have confirmed to subscribe.

“We have a number of investors that have expressed interest and we are working to get them the actual private placement memorandum and subscription agreement,” Tsai said.

One of the peer products in the equity option-based fund space is Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (ETB).

That $393 million fund’s total expense ratio is 111 bps including 100 bps management fee, which is on the lower end of the fee spectrum for option-based funds, according to Morningstar.

The average return in its option-based fund category is 1.25 percent over the last year, 5.1 percent over the three-year period and 10.44 percent year-to-date as of Sept. 17.

A risky game

One of the ways for this fund to work is to accurately identify mispricing in the call options market. However, it’s tricky to achieve that given crypto derivatives such as options, Samuel Lee, financial advisor at Chicago-based SVRN Asset Management, told CoinDesk.

“They are a very new asset class whose market is not very efficient,” Lee said, adding:

“Skilled investors are going to take a lot more advantage of those who are less skilled in such markets when compared to more mature equity and fixed income markets.”

The financial advisor also said, while it is possible for the firm to realize 18 percent monthly yield, the fund’s total return should matter more to investors.

“A lot of income funds with very high yields are often sacrificing price returns,” Lee said. “While you are getting hefty premiums, you could be sacrificing all that upside potential.”

Focusing too much on yield would also risk meeting monthly income targets with investors’ principal in the fund, he added.

However, inefficiency in the options market could be an opportunity for crypto-derivative funds, Lee explained.

“The more inefficient the market is, which means fewer smart people are looking at it, the more mispricing there is going to be,” he said.

Embedded transaction costs can also eat in the total returns of such funds, Lee added.

The wide bid-ask spread in the crypto derivatives market implies low liquidity and high transaction cost and there will also be taxes imposed on the income, according to Lee.

Built on derivatives

All of these funds are possible because of the operational simplicity today provided by major crypto exchanges offering new platforms to trade crypto derivatives.

This month, Binance acquired crypto exchange JEX to boost its crypto derivatives offerings for traders. The Seychelles-registered JEX offers spot and derivatives including options and futures trading in digital currencies.

In August, Crypto futures exchange Deribit said it has become one of the first crypto futures and options exchanges to provide large-volume trades of bitcoin and ether derivatives.

In March, Galaxy Capital-backed institutional trading and portfolio management platform Caspian launched trading in cryptocurrency derivatives including futures and options.

There are also more exchanges with plans to offer such services.

Derivatives marketplace CME Group announced in September that it will offer options on its bitcoin futures contracts starting in the first quarter of 2020.

Seed CX subsidiary Zero Hash – the company’s custodian and settlement service provider – will support derivatives transactions, and include options at a future date.

Will investors bite?

The prospects of new funds and structures may be exciting, but the jury is still out if the Wave fund will gain traction, as management waits for the first substantial investors to subscribe.

Tsai, who led alternative investments in the Asia-Pacific region at Alliance Berstein, said Wave Financial is approaching accredited investors and high-net-worth individuals, and it has been developing a distribution network across major international markets.

Several firms have expressed interest in distributing the fund, Tsai said, including one in Southeast Asia asking to be an exclusive distributor in the region.

Latin America is another region with potential, Tsai said.

“In my previous experience, the Latin American investors in the wealth management space actually buy similar products as Asian investors,” said Tsa, describing investors from these regions as being less risk-averse.

He said the fund offers investors a less volatile way to make money from bitcoin, as it earns premium as long as the BTC price increase is below 20 percent.

In addition, the crypto derivative-based fund could also diversify investors’ portfolios as it is uncorrelated to most traditional asset classes, Tsai said.

The launch of Bitcoin in 2009 was a breath of fresh air for crypto-anarchists who had been waiting for a stateless, decentralized payment method that provides them with complete control over their finances. Ten years later, there are a number of easy-to-use applications and services that privacy-conscious individuals can use.

In this guide, we will highlight 15 online tools for crypto-anarchists, privacy advocates, agorists, and really anyone who values their privacy in today's digital age.

Bitcoin wallets

Samourai Wallet is a bitcoin wallet that was built to “thwart blockchain-based surveillance and censorship.” This non-custodial Android wallet requires no email address or ID checks and comes with built-in Tor and VPN supports to provide the utmost privacy for bitcoin users.

Wasabi Wallet is another popular choice among privacy-fanatic bitcoin users. Wasabi Wallet is a non-custodial, open-source bitcoin wallet available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. The desktop wallet comes with Tor integration and trustless coin shuffling to provide privacy and fungibility for its users.

Browsers

Brave aims to provide its users with a private, secure, and fast internet browsing experience. This relatively new browser is a popular among cryptocurrency users due to its privacy-focus and its built-in ad monetization option for users.

Tor Browser is arguably the most popular browser that enables internet users to protect themselves against tracking and surveillance. Tor directs traffic through an overlay network to hide its users’ locations and usage data.

Email services

ProtonMail has established itself as one of the most popular encrypted email service providers. The user-friendly platform enables individuals to exchange emails privately without having a provider, such as Google, snooping on their emails. Additionally, ProtonMail is available also available for mobile users.

Tutanota is another popular private email service that applies end-to-end encryption to your emails to ensure only the intended recipients are able to read them. The team behind Tutanota believes that privacy is a fundamental human right and has developed its platform with that in mind.

Marketplaces

Haven is a relatively new privacy-focused, mobile marketplace. Using the Haven app, you can privately message other users, store and transfer cryptocurrencies, and buy and sell goods (in exchange for crypto) on an ecommerce platform that does not snoop on its users.

OpenBazar is arguably the most popular cryptocurrency-powered marketplace available today. The open-source protocol enables users to buy and sell products online on a decentralized platform that does not require or store user information. Additionally, the use of cryptocurrencies as a payment method increases the level of privacy of both vendors and customers.

Messaging apps

FrozenChat is a chat app for Android phones that enables users to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages. As soon as you type something, it gets encrypted, even before it is sent, which ensures that your conversation can remain private.

Signal is one of the most trusted encrypted messaging apps available today. Even the U.S. National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden recommends its use. The open-source application is available for both iOS and Android and leverages advanced end-to-end encryption to provide privacy for its users.

Search engines

DuckDuckGo is probably the most popular private alternative to Google. Unlike its “big brother” from Mountain View, DuckDuckGo does not collect user search history and provide it to third parties for marketing purposes (and god knows what else).

StartPage is another Google alternative that refers to itself as “the most private search engine.” Like, DuckDuckGo it does not harvest your data and sells it to other companies. You can use StartPage and know your search data is safe.

Virtual private networks

ExpressVPN is one of the most popular virtual private networks that gives users the ability to hide their IP locations. ExpressVPN defeats censorship and content restrictions to provide users with access to the content they want regardless of their physical location.

NordVPN is a market-leading VPN that provides users with a secure, encrypted internet surfing experience. NordVPN stores no logs and can even block annoying ads for you.

Private Internet Access (PIA) is relatively well-known in the cryptocurrency community as it accepts bitcoin as a payment method. PIA has over 3,300 services across 32 countries to enable users to hide their location from prying eyes.

In the day and age of big data and surveillance capitalism, we can learn a lot from crypto-anarchists and privacy advocates. The online tools listed above are not just for privacy fiends but for everyone who does not want their personal information to be used without their consent. To protect your privacy, you will have to take action yourself. No one else will protect your privacy for you.

Binance may be the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, but its days are numbered, says Calvin Ayre. | Image: REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi

While head of Binance CZ (Changpeng Zhao) celebrated the recent launch of his exchange’s new staking features, the head of CoinGeek, Calvin Ayre, was less optimistic.

Ayre: Binance Is Illegal, Will Be Shut Down in 12 Months

Speaking to CCN.com, Bitcoin SV (BSV) supporter and financier Calvin Ayre said introducing the rewards system for Proof-of-Stake (PoS) coins was the latest move in Binance’s corrupt chess-game – one which sees CZ knowingly mislead traders and manipulate coin prices.

“CZ’s entire business model is based on a speculative casino of tokens that have zero value. They manipulate the token prices to harvest all the traders who are sold messages to do the opposite of what the house needs for its scams.”

According to Ayre, the hammer is set to fall on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Just 12 months remain, according to the CoinGeek owner, before Binance will be shut down by one authority or another.

“It’s illegal and it will likely be shut down in the next 12 months.”

As a vocal supporter of BSV under the stewardship of Craig Wright, Ayre has reason to be frosty towards Binance. Earlier in the year, CZ decided to de-list BSV from the Binance exchange, which triggered a domino-effect of exchanges doing likewise.

Hard Forking Greivances

This was at a time when Bitcoin SV was in its nascent stages, fresh off the heels of a contentious hard-fork in November 2018. Losing the exposure afforded to it by the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange was viewed as a death-blow for BSV at the time.

Fast-forward six months and Bitcoin SV remains perched among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, while Binance has gone from strength to strength in the meantime.

However, Ayre thinks Binance amounts to little more than a casino, and that its patrons don’t realise the house was rigged against them from the start.

“All the tokens have the same intrinsic value; zero. They make them seem to be worth different amounts and then dump them to traders they lure in with their marketing. They are only pretending to be making profit on trading margin, they are really buying and selling to innocents who do not know this is all rigged against them.”

Such bold claims have become typical of Ayre, who has found a very suitable partner in the similarly outspoken Craig Wright.

The explosive comments may surprise those who know Binance only as the benevolent, charitable, philanthropic powerhouse it successfully presents itself as.

Binance: A Dark Past



However, it was not always so. Back in 2017, when Binance was an upstart cryptocurrency exchange fresh off the back of its own ICO, its public image wasn’t quite as clean cut.

Screenshots still exist of an exchange between DigiByte (DGB) community members and Binance Director of Business Development Ashley Ouyang, where the DigiByte team are openly extorted for the privilege of securing an exchange listing.

The matter was quietly forgotten in the daily news cycle, but after two years it has emerged once again. On September 20th, DigiByte founder Jared Tate revealed that during a video call with the Binance team, he was told to pay $300,000, as well as 3% of all DigiByte coins in order to finally get DGB listed.

Did a video call with the ”Binance” team a few weeks ago. They wanted $300,000 and 3% of all DGB for ”insurance for their customers against blockchain hacks & defects” to list $DGB. Told them that is not possible with a truly decentralized #blockchain like #DigiByte. — Jared Tate ©️ (@jaredctate) September 20, 2019

DigiByte is a community driven project without the marketing budgets afforded by corporately funded cryptocurrencies. Where other projects may have just bit the bullet and paid the fees in the past, DigiByte has no choice but to make a public fuss.

Extortion Funds Are SAFU

Binance chief CZ has since brushed off Jared Tate’s comments in the manner expected of a busy CEO, for whom such silliness isn’t worth his time.

Yet if Binance really were to be shut down in 12 months, it would more likely be because of scammy practices like these, rather than those mentioned by Calvin Ayre.

DigiByte is currently listed on 80 cryptocurrency exchanges, and according to the team, not a single one of those demanded a listing fee – let alone 3% of the entire coin supply.

Question: How much of the world’s cryptocurrency supply is locked up in Binance’s private vaults? Extortion funds are SAFU.

Despite alarm-ringing from respected figures in the crypto space, the ability for Binance to arbitrarily decide the fate of cryptocurrency projects remains uncontested. Binance, helmed by its own “Little CZaer”, is too big to fail at this point, and such scandals appear to just bounce right off it.

Any hope of justice for the DigiBytes of this world may only be found in the fact that Binance, like Rome, will inevitably fall one day. How much damage is done – and how much money is extracted from powerless community projects in the meantime, remains to be seen.

End Game

As for Calvin Ayre, he foresees a radical change-up to the current cryptocurrency exchange landscape.

“The only legitimate exchange business using this technology will be those trading of utility, security, commodity or other types of tokens that are tied to real world value and then also connecting all of these to fiat on and off ramps.”

That would mean a culling of at least 95% of all altcoins currently listed on exchanges worldwide. Ayre sees the likes of CZ and Binance as obstacles blocking the pursuit of this ultimate goal.

“This is where this will all end up, but it’s a real shame so many innocents people scammers like CZ are going to damage as we evolve to this end game.”",2019-09-29 12:48:18+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/north-korea-needs-its-own-national-crypto-cbdc-fever-spreads-in-asia,"It seems that a movement to create a national cryptocurrency is gaining momentum in Asia. Following China, the North Korean authorities announced their readiness to issue digital money and even indicated the availability of all required resources — both technical and human — to implement this task.

Will the government of the most isolated country in the world go further than its Asian neighbor, or is this just another attempt to scare the United States? Among the reasons for issuing a North Korean digital coin, experts name the circumvention of Western sanctions, money laundering, speculation and even the manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction.

All for cryptocurrencies?

In recent years, North Korea has become very interested in creating its own cryptocurrency and has a sufficient level of competence to move forward with this plan, as Alejandro Cao de Benos, a Special Delegate of the Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said.

According to Cao de Benos, local experts are now studying various digital assets in order to determine which of them the value of the future cryptocurrency should be tied to. He also said that there were no plans for it to be backed by the North Korean won and that it will be “more like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.”

But that's not all. On Sept. 10, Cao de Benos tweeted that the North Korean authorities have allowed citizens to own cryptocurrencies, and local developers “are designing crypto wallets and other related apps right now.”

It was also reported that other countries have helped North Korea in the technical implementation of its initiative. In particular, Cao de Benos referred to several foreign companies that have already signed contracts with the DPRK authorities for the development of blockchain systems for education, health care and finance sectors.

Although he didn’t provide any names, the Korea Development Bank (KDB) had pointed to the IT firm Joseon Expo a year earlier. The company allegedly created a platform for the exchange of cryptocurrencies between interested parties on the order of the North Korean authorities.

Despite bold statements by Cao de Benos, at the official level, the DPRK has so far refused to recognize or refute information about the intention of the country's administration to issue a national cryptocurrency.

Why North Korea may need its own cryptocurrency?

According to Kayla Izenman, a research analyst at the Center for Financial Crime and Security, the country has the necessary experience and resources to launch its own cryptocurrency. As for the reasons behind the initiative, experts tend to mostly come up with negative scenarios — from bypassing the international sanctions and money laundering to speculation and financing the weapons of mass destruction.

Bypassing U.S. sanctions?

According to many media outlets and Cao de Benos himself, Pyongyang needs digital assets to circumvent international sanctions. With its own cryptocurrency, the DPRK may be able to break away from the international financial system dependency. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cao de Benos noted two other advantages of cryptocurrencies — transaction speed and convenience — as an additional argument in favor of the initiative.

Analysts believe that for Pyongyang, digital money is a new way to circumvent sanctions because they are ""harder to trace, can be laundered many times, and are independent of government regulation."" This means that the DPRK may have the opportunity to trade with many countries around the world.

Sean King, vice president of the Park Strategies consultancy in New York, pointed out the “sanctions-proof” nature of cryptocurrencies, while Steven Kim, a researcher at the Jeju Peace Institute in South Korea, said:

“The cryptocurrency is the ideal form of money for North Korea because it can be moved quickly and anonymously across borders and can be used to buy goods and services online or converted to hard currency.”

While evading U.S. sanctions is the key factor behind the North Korea’s crypto initiative, Jason Tucker-Feltham, founder of blockchain security firm London Crypto Services, suggested to Cointelegraph that U.S. sanctions “have led the country to pursue alternative means of value transfer,” but this may not be the only benefit of digital assets noticed by North Korea. He went on:

“Economies and central banks for which no US sanctions are in place (e.g. the IMF) have expressed interest in developing their own crypto-assets, meaning that the benefits in utilising DLT extends far beyond bypassing traditional payment mechanisms.”

Moreover, as many analysts claim, North Korea may be backed by other countries — such as Iran, Russia or Venezuela — which are already exploring national digital assets to bypass the U.S. sanctions.

Cryptocurrencies allow for independence, which makes it almost impossible for the U.S. financial regulators to trace or control such forms of money. It's therefore possible to transact cryptocurrencies on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges that don't force users to pass Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. This makes it easier for hackers to freely and anonymously exchange their digital assets.

Moreover, it’s the U.S. authorities that forced North Korea to use cryptocurrencies, as suggested by Jose Pagliery, a CNN investigative reporter, who said, “The UN and the international community have locked them out of banks so whereas they used to hack into the SWIFT system in banks.”

Some experts claim North Korean hackers need and allegedly already use more transparent cryptocurrencies than Bitcoin (BTC) to bypass the sanctions. Izenman named Monero (XMR) and ZCash (ZEC) in particular:

“Cryptocurrency especially if you’re using such coins as Monero or ZCash that are privacy coins that aren’t as transparent as Bitcoin can be used and traded. And they don’t need to go through the fiat system, they don’t need to touch the dollar, they don’t need to touch a bank.”

Speculation

Being a country with a fairly low GDP ($28 billion compared to South Korea’s $1.54 trillion), North Korea has long been looking for and applying various ways to raise foreign capital. And cryptocurrencies are no exception.

It is being widely reported about how the DPRK uses several methods to obtain digital coins — from mining farms and masternodes to cryptojacking and participation in new, promising projects. Specifically, North Korea began mining Bitcoin in May 2017, which coincided with the rise of Bitcoin. Steven Kim, a researcher at the Jeju Peace Institute in South Korea, said, ""If there is a way to exploit cryptocurrencies for financial gain, the DPRK will figure it out and move aggressively to do so”

Many analysts noted cryptocurrency’s liquidity as a decisive factor in Pyongyang's interest in accumulating and creating digital assets, including CNN’s Richard Quest:

“There’s also reason for them to hack into the mining of Bitcoins and steal those Bitcoins as well because the price has been skyrocketing. [...] This is quite liquid. They can cash those Bitcoins out on the market and get dollars.”

Recently, financial crimes and AML experts Lourdes Miranda and Ross Delston released a detailed explanation of how the DPRK can use cryptocurrency for money laundering, which was later removed, however, from the website. In response to the question whether North Korea could create its own blockchain for manipulating crypto transactions domestically, they both answered, yes.

Nuclear weapon financing?

North Korea began looking for ways to finance military programs back in the 1970s, when the country was on the verge of default. As a result, a new structure was established, aimed at getting foreign currency for the DPRK authorities. According to a report prepared in 2007 for the U.S. Congress, such activities helped North Korea raise $5 billion.

On Aug. 13, the United Nations Security Council released an expanded report, according to which the amount of funds stolen by North Korea reached $2 billion. The authors of the report claimed that the government of Kim Jong Un hacked the accounts of banks and cryptocurrency exchanges in 17 countries in order to finance weapons of mass destruction programs, claims which the North Korean regime strongly denied. At the same time, cyber attacks were reportedly carried out under the leadership of the country's General Bureau of Intelligence.

The U.S. and South Korea believe that the DPRK’s online army consists of 20 to 30 elite cyber saboteurs specializing in cryptojacking. According to general estimates, the total number of cyber specialists may vary from 1,800 to 6,000 hackers.

The North Korean government itself rejects such allegations. Speaking with Cointelegraph Cao de Benos called such statements “ridiculous”. He added:

“The DPRK is already a nuclear power and we have enough to secure the safety of the country. This is why we are in negotiations with the USA.”

Meanwhile the local media says that the country has nothing to do with attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and, furthermore, doesn’t support any hackers. In particular, a representative of the DPRK National Coordinating Committee on combating money laundering and financing of terrorism said:

“Such a fabrication by the hostile forces is nothing but a sort of a nasty game aimed at tarnishing the image of our Republic and finding justification for sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK.""

Money laundering?

In their report, Miranda and Delston say that they are sure that Pyongyang is developing its own cryptocurrency in order to cash out money:

""DPRK can create their own cryptocurrencies or use established ones like Bitcoin. Having their own cryptocurrency would also facilitate their ability to open online accounts under the guise of a non-adversarial nation using anonymous communication to conceal the user’s locations and usage on the internet.”

The most difficult part in such a process, according to experts, is converting cryptocurrencies into traditional fiat funds anonymously. And North Korea’s own cryptocurrency system would most likely be able to solve this issue, as suggested by Miranda and Delston:

""For example, DPRK could open an online wallet using a Russia-based service, transfer its cryptocurrency into a Bulgaria-based wallet service and then transfer it again into a Greece-based wallet service, all through anonymous communication and using their own blockchain.""

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Tucker-Feltham explained why North Korea would likely build a private blockchain that wouldn’t be similar to Bitcoin:

“In view of it being a fully public blockchain, the Bitcoin network is poorly suited for facilitating money laundering, as upon identifying the owner of one public key all associated transactions can subsequently be traced. Furthermore, there is a blossoming industry in chain-analytics that looks to track behaviours on public blockchains. Such traits underpinning the Bitcoin blockchain may have factored into the decision to develop an entirely new blockchain; were North Korea to be developing a crypto-asset with the intention of its being untraceable, it stands to reason that their blockchain will not be public.”

When asked by Cointelegraph to comment on this rumor, Cao de Benos said:

“As for money laundry that's another stupidity. We don't need to launder anything because the DPRK is the most sanctioned country in the world and we are not able to trade and use the traditional financial system.”

What are they doing at blockchain conferences?

Along with the active exploitation of cryptocurrencies, DPRK authorities are conducting closed blockchain conferences and training courses. Specifically, in 2017, Pyongyang University of Science and Technology held an accelerated cryptocurrency course for elite students.

In April of this year, North Korea held the nation’s first international conference on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, bringing together foreign experts from around the world. It has been reported that participants paid 3,300 euros for the program, which included a tour to the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea. Nevertheless, there are no independent sources that would confirm how successful the conference was — as access was denied to any outside observers.

The organizers themselves said that the first event was so successful that they decided to hold a second one in February 2020. The conference is scheduled to last eight days and surpass the previous event in its scope. Cao de Benos emphasized that the event will see a big number of Korean government officials:

“The conference serves as a meeting opportunity but from there we will develop long lasting collaboration and business with professionals and companies. The participants in the Korean side are all working for the government in different important institutions in finance, logistics, trade, etc.”

Meanwhile, participation is still prohibited for citizens of South Korea, Japan, and Israel, while U.S. residents are allowed to attend the conference. Those wishing to attend will need to send a CV, a passport scan and home address, though it’s not clear where this all should be sent, as there are no official email addresses or websites.

Independent and anonymous analysts in South Korea believe that the main objective of the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference is to show that North Korea will develop and promote cryptocurrencies if the U.S. does not begin to move forward in bilateral negotiations.

Some in the media have said it is very likely that Russian experts will appear at the conference, which will testify to the seriousness of the cryptocurrency activities of the DPRK as a whole.

So, will a crypto be released?

Independent experts argue that Pyongyang has both the necessary resources and the technological experience to successfully develop a state cryptocurrency. Martin D. Weiss, the founder of Weiss Ratings, said in a conversation with Cointelegraph that there is every chance it could happen:

""The question is whether it would be possible for adversarial or rogue nations to use state-backed digital money to help establish an alternate system of international transactions, thereby weakening the West's ability to use sanctions as leverage against them. The answer is yes, provided they can handle large volumes.""

Weiss also noted that in the future, some countries could unite and create a single payment system based on cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, representatives of the state-run Korean Development Bank expressed a completely different point of view in their report, referring to the country's shortage of quality experts, computers and electricity.

Also, according to a senior fund manager at a U.S.-based investment bank in Seoul, the DPRK’s closed internet network may interfere with the implementation of the government’s plan, ""Because only limited Web access is available in the North, Pyongyang can't take advantage of cryptocurrencies in terms of unrestricted and anonymous transactions.""

Whether a national cryptocurrency would help North Koreans get out of its current economic troubles remains under question, considering other countries’ experience in this direction. For instance, attempts by Venezuela to save its economy with the state-owned cryptocurrency Petro haven’t yet yielded any obvious success.

Pyongyang may also have to convince partner countries to use its new cryptocurrency to circumvent Western sanctions. And this is not so easy to do when companies around the world use the U.S. dollar, according to Annie Fixler, a sanctions and illicit finance expert at the Washington, D.C.-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, who said:",

Bitcoin, (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, is on track to post a monthly loss of more than 16 percent – the biggest since November 2018, according to CoinMarketCap. As of writing, BTC is trading around $8,070, having hit a 3.5-month low of $7,838 earlier today.

Meanwhile, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has currently shed nearly 13.7 percent on a month-to-date basis, standing at $215 billion at press time.

Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency ether (ETH), however, is currently reporting a monthly gain of 0.30 percent. As of writing, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency is changing hands at $174.

In fact, ETH is the best performing top 10 cryptocurrency of September, as seen in the chart below (note, the tether stablecoin has been excluded).

Bitcoin SV (BSV) is the worst performing cryptocurrency this month, with a 35 percent monthly drop. BSV fell to a six-month low of $75 last week and is currently trading around $84.

Six out of the top 10 are reporting double-digit monthly declines.

The broad-based losses could be associated with the risk aversion triggered by bitcoin’s recent slide.

Big drop for bitcoin

Bitcoin fell by $2,000 last week, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change on technical charts.

The month had begun on a positive note, with BTC picking a bid around $9,500 and clocking highs near $10,900 on Sept. 6.

The bullish momentum, however, ran out of steam in the following two weeks, leaving BTC directionless despite the strengthening narrative that the surging hash rate or computing power would draw bids for the cryptocurrency.

The consolidation ended with last week’s 20 percent slide – its biggest weekly drop of 2019.

Mixed fortunes

Ether also fell by 20 percent last week to register its biggest weekly loss in over two months. Even so, the cryptocurrency is currently reporting marginal monthly gains at press time.

This is because the last week’s sell-off merely erased the gains seen in the preceding two weeks. The cryptocurrency had rallied from $178 to $222 in the 12 days to Sept. 19, before falling back to lows below $170 last week.

Ether’s price rise seen in the second and the third week of September had seemed to bode well for other alternative cryptocurrencies. For instance, XRP clocked a one-month high of $0.32 on Sept. 18 before sliding to a 658-day low of $0.22 on Sept. 24.

Litecoin’s corrective bounce also topped out at a one-month high of $79.45 on Sept. 18, before falling to $52.38 last week, the lowest level since March 6.

Most alternative cryptocurrencies are based on ethereum’s blockchain. Hence, many observers often consider ether’s rise, especially against BTC, a positive sign for alts.

ETH/BTC turned higher from Sept. 6 lows near 0.016 BTC and rose to a seven-week high of 0.02038 BTC on Sept. 19. As of writing, ether’s bitcoin-denominated exchange rate is seen at 0.02145 BTC.

Cuban made his remarks in a video Q&A published on YouTube by technology news outlet Wired on Sept. 27.

During the Q&A session, he answered to a Twitter user asking why Cuban hates crypto if he is “into providing opportunity for people to grow their net worth.”

First, Cuban seemingly suggested that the issue he has with Bitcoin is that its price is determined by the market's demand for it:

“Here’s the thing about crypto, particularly Bitcoin: Bitcoin is worth what somebody will pay for it.”

BTC has no intrinsic value

Cuban then argued that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. To better explain his thoughts on the matter, he compared the crypto asset to artwork, comic books and baseball cards:

“Did you ever see someone who collected baseball cards? And they were really, really, really proud of their baseball cards because they kept saying they were going to go up in price? Comic books — same thing, even artwork. There’s no real intrinsic value, you can’t eat a baseball card [...] Your artwork might look good on the wall but not much you can do with it. Bitcoin — there’s even less you can do with it: at least I can look at my baseball card [...] I can look at artwork.”

Bitcoin is like gold, it’s like a religion

Cuban then raised the concern that Bitcoin is too complicated for the average person, given the great number of options for its storage and theft prevention needs. This is where he notes that Bitcoin, often called digital gold, is actually really like gold:

“I say it’s like gold. Gold is a religion: people who are really into gold — they’ll tell you that there’s a bad depression and things go to hell in a handbasket, if you own gold then you’ll be okay. No, you won’t! You carry around a gold bar — someone’s gonna hit your ass, knock you out and steal your gold bar and it’s gonna happen again and again and again. I’d rather have bananas, I can eat bananas. Crypto… Not so much.”

This idea is in line with what Cuban said in August when he noted that Bitcoin is fundamentally similar to gold and defined them both as collectibles.

Cuban did admit that he is not “against cryptocurrencies” — however, he warned investors to be very careful as, at best, they’re stored value.

As Cointelegraph reported in July, Cuban defined Facebook’s Libra stablecoin as a big mistake. He noted that “globally and in countries where there isn’t a lot of rules of law, or a lot of government stability, or currency stability, then it could be dangerous.”",,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/bitcoin-coinbase-kraken-to-create-cryptocurrency-rating-system.html,"Cryptocurrurrency exchange operators including Coinbase, Kraken and Circle have teamed up to create a system that rates digital tokens on how close they are to securities.

The points-based rating system, unveiled by Coinbase in a blog post Monday, determines whether a digital asset falls under U.S. securities law using guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

""The result of the analysis is a score which makes it easy for members to synthesize the analysis across many tokens and make their own, independent business decisions about whether or how to support an asset,"" Coinbase said in the blog post.

The framework was established by a newly formed organization set up by the firms, called the Crypto Rating Council. It's aimed at helping financial services companies that are looking to add support for certain cryptocurrencies but are uncertain of their legal status.

It rates digital tokens on a scale of one to five, one being an asset with few or no characteristics of a security, and five sharing the most in common with a security.

Aside from Coinbase, Kraken and Circle, founding members of the council also include Anchorage, Bittrex, DRW Cumberland, Genesis and Grayscale Investments.",2019-09-30,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190930101303.htm,"The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is limited by its astronomical electricity consumption and outsized carbon footprint. A nearly zero-energy alternative sounds too good to be true, but as School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) Professor Rachid Guerraoui explains, it all comes down to our understanding of what makes transactions secure.

To explain why the system developed in his Distributed Computing Lab (DCL) represents a paradigm shift in how we think about cryptocurrencies -- and about digital trust in general -- Professor Rachid Guerraoui uses a legal metaphor: all players in this new system are ""innocent until proven guilty.""

This is in contrast to the traditional Bitcoin model first described in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, which relies on solving a difficult problem called ""consensus"" to guarantee the security of transactions. In this model, everyone in a distributed system must agree on the validity of all transactions to prevent malicious players from cheating -- for example, by spending the same digital tokens twice (double-spending). In order to prove their honesty and achieve consensus, players must execute complex -- and energy-intensive -- computing tasks that are then verified by the other players.

But in their new system, Guerraoui and his colleagues flip the assumption that all players are potential cheaters on its head.

""We take a minimalist approach. We realize that players don't need to reach consensus; they just need to prevent malicious behavior when it manifests,"" he explains. ""So, we assume everyone is honest, and if players see someone trying to do something wrong, they ignore that player -- and only that player.""

With the consensus requirement out of the way, the DCL's new system, dubbed Byzantine Reliable Broadcast, can achieve safe cryptocurrency transactions on a large scale with an energetic cost of virtually zero -- ""roughly equivalent to that of exchanging emails,"" Guerraoui says -- and just a few grams of CO2 compared to an estimated 300 kg for a single Bitcoin transaction. ?

That could be a big advantage over Bitcoin, which has been reported to have a global electricity consumption approaching that of Austria, and a global carbon footprint comparable to that of Denmark.

Communication is key

So, how can users be sure that cryptocurrency transactions are secure if they are not sure who the malicious players are? Guerraoui says: players just need to communicate with each other.

""If a malicious player wants to make a payment, for example, this system would not allow anyone to accept money from that player until a randomly chosen sample has confirmed the player has not sent money to anyone else; otherwise, the payment will not be accepted,"" he explains. ""Basically, we're saying that you only need to exchange information with a sample of players to implement a cryptocurrency.""

The central element of communicating, or broadcasting, information is what gives the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast system its name. After first publishing the theoretical results behind the system earlier this year in the proceedings of the 2019 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (ACM PODC), one of the two most prestigious conferences in the field, Guerraoui and his colleagues have recently published a second paper describing the implementation and scale-up of their algorithm.

advertisement

For its description of the first scalable solution to a consensus alternative, the second DCL paper has already garnered interest from industry, and won the Best Paper Award at the field's other top conference, DISC 2019 (the 33rd International Symposium on Distributed Computing). The award will be presented in Budapest, Hungary in mid-October.

From banking to bikeshares

In addition to its lower cost and energy expenditure, the Byzantine Reliable Broadcast system sacrifices nothing in terms of transaction security. While it has a narrower range of applications than Bitcoin -- being suitable only for cryptocurrencies, and not for more complex transactions like smart contracts -- the system can manage other forms of currency besides money.

""It could be used for an abstract cryptocurrency for exchanging goods, like bikes in a bike-sharing program for example,"" Guerraoui says.

He and his colleagues plan to release their new system as an open-source code for anyone to download and use by the end of 2020.

This research is being carried out as part of an ERC Proof-of Concept Grant won by Guerraoui earlier this year, aimed at putting a new class of ""consensusless"" algorithms into practice.

Two San Diego men admitted in federal court Monday to conspiring to launder dark-web proceeds through an unlicensed money- transmitting business that exchanged cryptocurrency for cash.

As part of their guilty pleas, Connor Brooke, 25, and Aidan Curry, 23, agreed to forfeit tens of thousands of dollars worth of cash, cryptocurrency and sophisticated high-end hardware, including computers, phones, hard drives and storage devices that they used to carry out their scheme.

Brooke and Curry committed the offenses while managing a San Diego- based business that sold Bitcoin for a premium, and always in cash, to the public, according to prosecutors.

People who buy or sell contraband via online black markets — collectively known as the dark web — conduct their transactions with cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, because it provides them with perceived anonymity.

As outlined in the plea agreements entered Monday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Berg in San Diego federal court, Brooke and Curry conducted, controlled, managed, supervised, directed and owned all or part of a cryptocurrency-based money-transmitting business called BayCoins.

Curry described the unlicensed MTB to an acquaintance over text messages, stating, “I’m basically like a currency-exchange place for Bitcoin,” pointing out that he and Brooke advertised their business on a website that was equivalent to the “Craigslist of Bitcoin.”

By August 2018, BayCoins had posted two separate online solicitations, one with Brooke’s information and the other with Curry’s, court documents state. The advertisements promised “quick, easy and hassle-free” Bitcoin transactions with a “non-negotiable” 5% transaction fee.

By solely accepting cash — as opposed to other forms of payment, such as electronic money transfers, checks or cash deposits into a bank account – – the defendants operated their business in relative anonymity and evaded the anti-money-laundering scrutiny of other licensed and registered financial institutions, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Diego.

BayCoins generated sufficient profits, alongside a growing inventory of cryptocurrency, to fund the Brooke and Curry’s acquisition, sale and distribution of marijuana on various dark-web marketplaces, court documents state. After receiving payment for the drug, Brooke and Curry sold cryptocurrency for additional profit through BayCoins.

Federal authorities “will continue to pursue, uncover and dismantle money laundering and narcotics-trafficking organizations seeking to operate behind multiple layers of anonymity — whether it’s the dark web, through unlicensed money-transmitting businesses or with sophisticated software,” said Robert Brewer, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California.

“Compliance with the anti-money-laundering laws of the United States is not an option,” Brewer said. “We treat knowing compliance failures for what they are — a crime.”

The defendants will each face a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine at their sentencing, scheduled for Jan. 6.

Follow Us:",2019-09-30,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-bithumbs-333-million-acquisition-may-be-in-jeopardy,"A deal to acquire cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb for over $300 million remains in choppy waters.

According to The Korea Herald on Monday, fintech firm BK Global Consortium’s deal to buy a majority stake in the major South Korean exchange has not yet been fully paid for.

In October 2018, BTC Korean Holdings had agreed to sell 51 percent of its share in Bithumb to BK Global Consortium for $333 million. Since the deal was brokered, BK Global reportedly made a down payment of $100 million.

However, sources close to the matter told the news source that BK Global pushed back the April deadline for completing the purchase on the condition that it would increase its stake in Bithumb from 51 percent to 70 percent. However, the report said BK Global has again missed a Sept. 30 deadline for the final payment.

The Herald said the firm has been seeking various partnerships or buyouts to secure the remaining capital for the acquisition.

One such investor, Cho Yoon-hyeong of electronic equipment manufacturer Cornerstone, is rumored to be contributing some $125 million toward BK Global’s exchange purchase.

On Monday, Cho disputed that the deal would fall apart following the second extension.

“The deal is proceeding smoothly, and we’re working on details with BTC Holdings.”

A Bithumb representative concurred, stating “Bithumb has stable management, so there won’t be any impact should the deal collapse.”

The Minister of Finance in Uganda, Hon. Matia Kasaija, has come out strongly and said that the Government of Uganda does not issue or regulate cryptocurrencies and therefore does not recognize them as legal tender.

The official statement reads:

“The Government of Uganda does not recognize crypto-currency as the legal tender in Uganda and has not licensed any organization in Uganda to sell crypto-currencies or to facilitate trade in crypto-currencies.”

[Advertisement]

Mr. Kasaija went on to address the emergence of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and warned about ‘using, holding, trading dangers associated with crypto-currencies” saying that organizations trading or facilitating crypto trade in Uganda are ‘not regulated by the Government or any of its agencies.’

The statement concludes by advising the public to appraise themselves of the risks associated with cyber-currencies, and exercise caution before they make transactions involving such products.

The above statement is surprising considering that Uganda is the first African country to license Binance crypto exchange, the largest exchange in the world by volume. Uganda is also home to the first Binance fiat crypto exchange – Binance Uganda! The exchange is already operating legally in the country with the CEO, ChangPeng Zhao, having met the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, in 2018.

The Blockchain Association of Uganda is also one of the strongest and most active blockchain associations across Africa. In addition, Uganda is also home to CryptoSavannah, a reputable blockchain company in the East African region.

Uganda hosted, for the second time in 2019, the largest blockchain conference in Africa, which has attracted top government officials, from both in Uganda and across Africa, including the former president of Mauritius, Ameenah Gurib, current president of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada, The Prime Minister of Uganda, Ruhakana Rugunda, and the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni.

Earlier this year the Australian Tax Office (ATO) announced that it will be allocating a billion dollars to track down and fine those who haven’t filed taxes on their crypto activity. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies bouncing back this year, it’s likely many, perhaps you, will owe capital gains taxes.

The government announced that it will be partnering with both Australian cryptocurrency trading platforms as well as global ones in order to obtain information about users. It will use this data to track down and fine those who don’t make tax filings of their own accord. Many falsely believe that cryptocurrency transactions are untraceable; but by requiring platforms to report on their users as well as hiring blockchain forensics companies, the government has its bases covered. Do you?

The ATO announced that it will be running a data matching campaign by collecting bulk data from Australian cryptocurrency designated service providers in order to identify exactly who owes taxes to the government. Deputy Commissioner, Will Day, stated for the press that “the ATO uses third party data to improve the integrity of the tax system by identifying taxpayers who fail to disclose their income details correctly.” He continued by saying that “this data will be collected under notice from the DSPs on an ongoing basis.” The ATO has every intention to keep cryptocurrency ownership and use regulated in order to support legal transactions and to enact taxation.

About 4% of the Australian population owns or has owned cryptocurrency, according to the government. This means up to a million people could be affected by the ATO’s action. If you are one of these people or you know someone who is, consider the consequences of not filing your capital gains taxes on cryptocurrency.

The government announced that it expects a $3 billion return on its $1 billion campaign. Where does it expect this money to come from? Fees and fines on cryptocurrency traders who do not report their capital gains. The government announced that tax avoiders can expect fines or even jail time depending on the severity of the crime. Traders can avoid the risk and stress by reporting capital gains and income from cryptocurrency trades on their tax return.

On the other hand, let’s say that a crypto owner lost money on his or her sale of cryptocurrency. How would that work? Let’s say that someone buys bitcoin at 5,000 AUD and then it drops to 3,000 AUD but they still need to sell it. At the end of the year, when filing taxes, that person will have what is called a capital loss. Because cryptocurrency is a capital asset, when it is sold at a lower price than it was purchased at, the owner is entitled to tax benefits. Essentially, whenever someone has capital losses, they can use those capital losses to offset the taxes they need to pay on gains from other assets such as stocks and bonds. However, these capital losses can only be used to offset paying specifically capital gains taxes, not just any tax. For more information on capital gains and losses, look at this article by the ATO (here). Although you need to file regardless of whether you made or lost money, it’s an added benefit because there could be an economic benefit to you doing so.

To clarify: the events that trigger capital gains and losses are unique when talking about cryptocurrency. There are certain events having to do with crypto that are considered capital gains or losses. On the other hand, if no triggers happen and one holds their currency through the tax year without selling, purchasing or trading, even if the currency triples in value, they will not have capital gains because they have not sold the asset. From the ATO’s website: “A Capital Gains Taxation (CGT) event occurs when you dispose of your cryptocurrency. A disposal can occur when you:

sell or gift cryptocurrency

trade or exchange cryptocurrency (including the disposal of one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency)

convert cryptocurrency to fiat currency (a currency established by government regulation or law ), such as Australian dollars, or

use cryptocurrency to obtain goods or services.

If you make a capital gain on the disposal of cryptocurrency, some or all of the gain may be taxed. Certain capital gains or losses from disposing of a cryptocurrency that is a personal use asset are disregarded. If the disposal is part of a business you carry on, the profits you make on disposal will be assessable as ordinary income and not as a capital gain. While a digital wallet can contain different types of cryptocurrencies, each cryptocurrency is a separate CGT asset.” For more information, please find the article attached here.

So now that you’ve decided to file your cryptocurrency taxes, how exactly does it work and what is deterring you? To file cryptocurrency gains or losses, one must take into account every single transaction, the cost in fiat of the coin, and the gain or loss of that trade. For those of you with many transactions, this quickly turns into a huge headache.

At first glance it might seem hard to file accurate taxes on your trades, and nearly impossible if you didn’t keep records. Don’t worry though, Australia Crypto Tax is here for you. This innovative company has created an easy solution that can calculate your capital gains or losses quickly and accurately.

Bitcoin outshining gold?

On Oct. 1 the Munich-based, state-owned bank published its latest research report that seems to suggest that the forthcoming Bitcoin halving effect is yet to be factored into its current price of about $8,300.

The financial institution explained that gold had to earn its high stock-to-flow ratio “the hard way over the course of millennia.” Bitcoin on the other hand will most likely succeed to obtain a similar stock-to-flow ratio to that of gold in the coming year, the report predicts.

Senior FX analyst at the Bayerische Landesbank and author of the research report Manuel Andersch, says stock-to-flow ratios are a a way to quantify the “hardness” of the asset. Andersch said:

“Historically speaking, it has invariably been the commodity with the highest stock-to-flow ratio at that juncture which has been used as money because this enabled the best value transfer over time.”

The stock-to-flow ratio of a commodity such as gold is the amount of the asset that is held in reserves, divided by the amount of the asset produced annually.

The author concludes the report by saying that the Bitcoin's stock-to-flow ratio is certain to substantially increase in May 2020, adding:

“If the May 2020 stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin is factored into the model, a vertiginous price of around USD 90,000 emerges. This would imply that the forthcoming halving effect has hardly been priced into the current Bitcoin price of approximately USD 8,000.”

Gold bug pounces on Bitcoin price drop

Clearly not everyone will agree with BayernLB’s price prediction. Cointelegraph previously reported that gold bug Peter Schiff returned to bashing Bitcoin as it fell from $9,700 to a low of $7,990 in hours. The Bitcoin critic claimed the shedding of $1,800 was just the start, saying:",,https://cryptoslate.com/analyzing-wealth-concentration-bitcoin-ethereum-xrp/,"Analysis shows that XRP has much higher wealth concentration than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Nevertheless, such concentration poses risks for all three coins. Here’s why.

Wealth concentration by the numbers

In August, blockchain analytics firm Coin Metrics released data around different coins and their wealth concentrations. Here are snippets for the top three coins by market capitalization:

The numbers show that Bitcoin, as the largest network, has the largest total number of addresses with meaningful balances—indicating a leading distribution of funds and greater usage when compared to other coins.

Meanwhile, Ethereum addresses tend to have the smallest balances of the top three, indicating relatively strong wealth dispersion. Finally, tokens on XRP appear highly concentrated, potentially posing greater price risk for holders.

These figures are even more striking when normalized by market capitalization.

Once adjusted, Ethereum is by far in the lead in terms of meaningful accounts and wealth dispersion. Moreover, it closes the gap between XRP and Bitcoin in terms of meaningful accounts as well.

The most alarming aspect though is the difference between median address balances. Adjusted median balances for XRP is 5-times that of Bitcoin and 32-times that of Ethereum. This may indicate that relatively few people are using XRP to meaningfully transact, despite much lower fees than Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is also suggestive of higher overall levels of centralization.

Critics may argue that the average is skewed because Ripple and its insiders hold over 50 percent of the token supply (worth approximately $13 billion at current prices). However, given that these reserves are only held in a handful of addresses the median shouldn’t be materially impacted.

Complicating factors

It’s important to keep in mind that these figures aren’t directly comparable and should only be used to approximate wealth concentration. A single user can easily own multiple addresses while multiple users can also control a single address (through multi-signature accounts).

Fundamentally, these protocols also have characteristics that may skew the above metrics. Ethereum is an account-based protocol, which means users often re-use addresses, meaning the number accounts could be under-counted.

Bitcoin uses a UTXO-based protocol, which tends to result in many throwaway addresses which could inflate its numbers. But, Ethereum’s gas fee mechanic tends to leave behind small balances in accounts, dragging the average down. Appropriately adjusting for all of these factors is a difficult task.

Why this is important

Wealth distribution is important for the health of a public blockchain for several reasons, primarily in relation to decentralization—a key value proposition of the technology. As said by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in a 2017 essay:

“Many have said that decentralization is the most important property of systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.”

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has been emphatic that XRP Ledger is decentralized. In October of 2018 at the Ripple-sponsored “Swell” conference in San Francisco, he called the ledger “very clearly decentralized,” arguing that “anybody can participate in the XRP ecosystem.” This narrative has been echoed by CTO David Schwartz and disseminated through the company’s official channels.

Thought leaders in the industry care about decentralization. Experts in the field have argued that decentralization imbues well-designed blockchain systems with several useful properties. Blockchains are less likely to fail than traditional systems, more expensive to attack and destroy, and more resistant to collusion from participants, argued Buterin.

In contrast, high levels of wealth concentration are correlated to high-levels of decision-making centralization. It also puts purchasers at a disadvantage because it only takes a single entity to harm the price. In all, wealth concentration poses additional risk for investors.

One well-discussed example is the price action around XRP. Much of the value of the coin is derived from the success and actions of Ripple, a single corporation. If Ripple wanted to extract value from investors it could sell its holdings on the open market while reallocating those resources to services that have no relation to XRP. Worse yet, If Ripple decided to extricate itself from XRP it would result in catastrophic losses for investors.

Wealth concentration problems are exacerbated on proof-of-work systems, like what is planned for ETH 2.0 and what is already implemented on EOS. Systems which use tokens to determine the outcome of elections and make decisions give tokens direct power of the system.

Consequently, for proof-of-stake systems it’s essential tokens are distributed widely and equitably, otherwise the system is at risk of unwanted collusion and rent-seeking. Over the long-run, these systems are in jeopardy of increasing amounts of decision-making centralization as large token-holders implement rules which benefit themselves at the expense of users on the platform.

Counter arguments

Though, there are also sound counter arguments to the theory that public blockchains require fair levels of wealth distribution. In a July 2017 essay, the former CTO of Coinbase Balaji Srinivasan argued:

“In practice it appears that a very high level of wealth centralization is still compatible with the operation of a decentralized protocol.”

At the time, Srinivasan discussed a framework for measuring decentralization to assess the resilience of a blockchain. He theorized that blockchains are bottle-necked by their most centralized point of failure. In other words, a blockchain is only as decentralized as its most centralized part.

If this is the case, then high levels of wealth concentration may not matter if there is an even more egregious point of centralization for BTC, ETH, and XRP.

Risks for the three coins

When applied to cryptos these theories could help investors make better decisions about each of the platforms.

For Bitcoin, large amounts of wealth concentration allow whales to manipulate the markets. By conducting strategic trades with large amounts of BTC it’s possible to take advantage of retail investors for profit.

Though, other less liquid coins such as ETH and XRP are at an even greater risk of market manipulation. However, small volume also means the potential profit from such behavior is constrained.

Under Balaji Srinivasan’s framework wealth concentration may not be Bitcoin’s main risk. Something like mining concentration in China could act as an even greater point of failure for the network.

For Ethereum, as the protocol moves to proof-of-stake in ETH 2.0, then token holdings will translate directly into political control over the system’s governance. These systems run the risk of turning into plutocracies, where rich token holders enact policies to enrich themselves at the expense of average users, making a blockchain less competitive over time. This phenomenon tends to be exacerbated by low voter participation on public blockchains, as demonstrated by EOS and TRON.

Finally, for those investing in XRP there are other concerns. Many enthusiasts think Ripple is a good steward of their reserves. Because they locked the majority of their coins in escrow and pegged the sales to market trading volume, token holders can supposedly have more confidence they won’t get diluted.

But, many of these large token holders aren’t Ripple and would not have the same self-imposed restrictions. In addition to Ripple regularly selling large chunks of XRP these large token holders could also be holding down the price of the coin.

Understanding wealth concentration for each cryptocurrency is an important factor to consider. Incorporating the metric into the assessment for each protocol helps people make better decisions about long-term growth potential and fundamental risk.",2019-10-01 02:24:02+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/shots-fired-as-nancy-pelosi-challenger-bacelar-funds-campaign-with-crypto/,"Nancy Pelosi Challenger Bacelar Funds Campaign With Crypto

Bacelar’s campaign donation page for crypto reads like an anti-luddite, utopian futuristic manifesto. But it does so in very compelling fashion, stating that “Agatha is running against Nancy Pelosi because it’s clear that the political establishment wants to hold back a future where economic freedom is afforded to all.” Mirroring millennial favorite presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s blockchain buzzword slinging, the page goes on to proclaim:

We need a future where we are able to use the incredible people-power of blockchain technologies to build a better, more just, and innovative society.

Bacelar comes from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) background, and as such falls within a key subset of politicians for younger voters. She states on her campaign page, citing issues like systemic inequality and climate: “These problems keep me up at night, and they’ve been getting worse for as long as Nancy Pelosi has held office—which is longer than I’ve been alive.” Shots fired.

Popular U.S. exchange Coinbase is facilitating Bacelar’s crypto funding drive, with several major coins being accepted to help spur on the San Franciscan’s push to kick the old blood out of congress. Pelosi, who has been a congressional representative since 1987, will be defending her spot in the upcoming 2020 primary elections against three other democratic candidates (at press time), with Bacelar being recognized by many as the long shot. The incumbent certainly has time and a lengthy résumé on her side, but with the tectonic plates of the tech world rumbling more than ever, and increasing fears that the global economy is facing an unprecedented downturn, a fresh face with an understanding of crypto might be an easy sell for many.

Bacelar’s campaign page declares:

The once-bright future for crypto in America has been dimming. San Francisco, once a headquarters for the crypto industry, has suffered as federal intervention pushed innovators out of our district and the country. Blockchain startups no longer incorporate in the US, while regulatory inaction and policies favoring big tech companies have allowed monopolies to block out competition that the next web would bring.

More Vague Blockchain Talk vs. Real Progress

Of course, many crypto OGs and libertarian Bitcoin enthusiasts aren’t buying the political rhetoric hook, line and sinker, as talk of the virtues of blockchain is in no short supply, even among federal anti-crypto dinosaurs like U.S. treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. When asked about Bitcoin in a recent interview, the former Goldman Sachs executive stated “I think the technology has certain clear uses,” but preemptively added “I would separate blockchain from bitcoin.” Andrew Yang’s ostensible support also seems to boil down to more of a general praise for the vague buzzword, and not for permissionless, decentralized electronic cash in and of itself.

Bacelar hums a slightly more focused tune, perhaps, but only time and election results will tell if the innovation she hopes to bring will amount to anything significant for those in the crypto space. As for the commentary on Pelosi’s Facebook stock, it seems the young San Fran upstart may see hypocrisy and ineptitude in accusing the group of allowing Russian election interference to occur, while still holding a hefty chunk of shares and demanding unilateral internet censorship.

During the early morning hours of September 30, a nine-minute video circulated on Twitter showing a large bitcoin mining farm burning down. Sources say the mining farm belonged to the company Innosilicon and roughly $10 million worth of mining rigs were destroyed.

$10 Million Dollars of Miners Up in Smoke

On Monday, cryptocurrency advocates shared a video on Twitter which shows a large fire destroying a warehouse filled with bitcoin mining rigs. The first video was shared at 10 a.m. by early bitcoin miner Marshall Long who tweeted: “[This] big datacenter from Innosilicon just went nuclear — Dovey Wan did you see this?” A few hours later, the founding partner at crypto asset holding company Primitive Ventures, Dovey Wan, also shared a longer video of the fire in China. Wan stated: As [Marshall Long] already broke it, here is the real footage of a local mega farm caught on fire — Which claimed a loss of $10M worth of mining machines.”

Details about the mega-mining farm remain sparse, but news.Bitcoin.com’s sources say that the $10 million dollar mining facility did in fact burn down due to “faulty wiring and bad PSUs.” Our source, who asked to remain unnamed, said that the facility was located in Inner Mongolia. Innosilicon’s headquarters is located in Wuhan, a commercial center adjacent to the Yangtze and Han rivers. A few people did reach out to Innosilicon on Twitter, but the company has not made any official comments at the time of publication.

BTC Network Saw a Slight Hashrate Anomaly

The last major fire reported at a bitcoin mega farm was in 2014 when a warehouse-style facility in Thailand lost millions of dollars’ worth of Spondoolies Tech miners. At the time, a Spondoolies Tech representative blamed the fire on mismanaged electrical and network cabling.”[The] buildup was definitely not according to U.S. electric code,” the representative said. The speculative fire discussions on September 30 were quickly tied to a hashrate anomaly that took place at roughly the same time. BTC’s hashrate did drop and a few people reported an unusual mining occurrence with BTC block 597,273.

“Block 597,273 was mined 119 minutes after its parent,” explained Antoine Le Calvez on Twitter. “This happened only 10 times in Bitcoin’s history, the last time in May of 2014.” Le Calvez continued:

Assuming blocks come in 10 minutes on average, this interblock time has a 0.000679% chance of occurring.

Since yesterday’s reported fire and the drop in hashrate, the price of BTC has started to rise again. The hashrate did see a low of 72 exahash per second (EH/s) on Monday but has since jumped back to 91EH/s on Tuesday morning. The videos of the fire shared on Twitter were followed by an Innosilicon announcement that detailed the firm would have to delay its Grin G32 mining rig shipments “due to a shortage at the foundry.”

Innosilicon’s notice says that customers willing to wait the extra length of time will receive a $75 coupon. The announcement on Twitter prompted a few speculators to ask the company if the reported fire in China had anything to do with the shipment delay.

WEG Bank AG CEO Matthias von Hauff told CoinDesk the program is now accepting retailer applications for a sandbox test group, with applications opening to the public in early 2020.

“You don’t have to be a customer of the bank,” he said. “All we do is provide the regulatory framework in the background, to make sure when the retailer receives crypto, he actually receives fiat in his bank account, if he chooses.”

Since program partner Salamantex has already tested such point-of-sale devices in Austria, von Hauff said this new bank “stakeholder” will allow retailers to send crypto payments to their own wallets or cash out in fiat directly to a bank account. The program will be administered by WEG Bank AG’s new fintech brand, TEN31.

He added the program will start with bitcoin, litecoin and several other undisclosed crypto assets. Last week the bank offered NIM and TPAY to people who participated in a Twitter contest.

Speaking to broader plans for 2020 and beyond, von Hauff added:

“We will not limit ourselves to just point-of-sale terminals. We will do online checkout, ATMs and we are currently investigating the option to integrate a [crypto] exchange into the bank as well.”

It’s unclear which exchange the bank may be able to integrate with in the future, or how. The goal is to have the first OASIS test transactions working with WEG Bank AG and a non-custodial liquidity provider by end of 2019, according to Nimiq co-creator Elion Chin.

“What we envision with OASIS is that we are able to create a non-custodial connection between the blockchain world and the traditional bank or bank-account world,” Chin told CoinDesk.

As for other prospective DEXs, TokenPay also owns equity in the DEX startup eFIN.

“We are looking forward to working with WEG Bank to integrate eFIN, a cross-chain noncustodial DEX,” TokenPay CEO Derek Capo told CoinDesk.

Nimiq and TokenPay were both funded by initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to the Nimiq transparency report from September 2019, the project’s team spent roughly $3.5 million worth of the $12.8 million garnered during the 2017 ICO on 9.9 percent equity in WEG Bank AG. The other two crypto companies involved with the TEN31 project own the same amount of equity, although the Litecoin Foundation received its shares for free from TokenPay.

Regardless of the many brand names now involved, WEG Bank AG itself will be the regulated entity facilitating compliant services.

“This solution will make the on-boarding to get into crypto much smoother,” Nimiq’s Chin said, adding:

“My hope would be that this type of solution would make it smoother, faster, easier, to the point where my parents would get comfortable with it too.”

Facebook’s proposed launch of a new cryptocurrency, Libra, has certainly stirred up some interest. Not to mention controversy.

The initiative is backed by a 27-strong consortium, the Libra Association, based in Switzerland. Facebook subsidiary Calibra has a leading role, and other key participants that have been announced include Visa, MasterCard, Lyft, Uber, Vodafone Group and many others across blockchain, telecommunications, payments and venture capital firms, as well as non-profit organisations.

Libra’s declared mission to create a simple global currency and financial infrastructure and its initial remit is to serve the underbanked in developing countries. The idea is to give anyone with a mobile phone and internet access the ability to transfer funds across the globe instantly, securely and at a low cost. The cryptocurrency can also be translated into an actual currency on receipt.

To coincide with Libra’s planned 2020 launch, Facebook also acquired an Israeli start-up, Servicefriend, to support the rollout of the currency by building AI-driven chatbots which will be used to interact with customers.

Urs Bolt, partner at BIG Blockchain Innovation Group, says: “Libra is certainly a controversial topic of conversation and many people are sceptical about whether it will succeed or not. But it is interesting, as it is a strong consortium of businesses and therefore should have the means, the reach and the power to be something successful.”

Libra will run on a blockchain network secured at launch by 100 distributed computer servers, or nodes. Each blockchain algorithm will be put to work as a command-line program suitable for interactive use or scripting, with consistent options and file formats throughout the toolkit. It will also be Byzantine fault-tolerant, meaning faulty behaviour by some of the actors in the network will not compromise the security of the broader network. In fact, the Libra blockchain makes it very hard for any attacker, as they would need to compromise 33 separately run nodes when launching an attack against the system.

Each of the association partners will operate an independent network node (a server) that will support transaction validation and share the transactions throughout the network. It also has a consensus-based algorithm – once two-thirds of the partners have approved a transaction, it will take place and be recorded.

Daniele Mensi, chief marketing sales officer at NextHash, says: “The consensus algorithm means that the two-thirds approval, when reached, will make for automatic updating of the distributed ledger. It is also built on a programming language which is much more scalable and can process 1,000 payments per second. This is unlike Bitcoin, which currently only has capacity for two per second.”

That being said, Bitcoin does have a solution for this in so far as it has a ‘lightning network’ that can sit on top and aggregate payments before they are validated. This creates vast efficiency and also makes it scalable. All is not lost.

However, the backing of software giants with cash-heavy balance sheets within the Libra association does mean that scale, intrinsic usability and further refinements are likely.

‘Libra will have a reserve, much like central banks, and will be able to create or destroy units of value but it is not a single national currency and so will fluctuate differently to a single currency.’

Aside from user uptake, the biggest issue that Libra has lies with national regulators. A number of major jurisdictions (US, EU) have expressed concerns about the various strengths of cryptocurrencies, with authorities in France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe, while China and India have outright banned it. Countering this, Libra is aimed to be regulator-friendly by design and so, in theory, should be able to meet know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering requirements of any regulator without undue concern.

However, there are other issues. Libra will be fully collateralised by a basket of currencies and short-term debt obligations. This makes it a ‘stablecoin’. While this means that Libra’s value may fluctuate as foreign currency rates change, by design it is intended to be fairly stable to enable payments and remittances.

A run on Libra would be serious, as there would not be a central bank to stop it. And at the same time, if take-up is good, the Libra Reserve is likely to grow to such a size that it will become ‘too big to fail’ – giving rise to a systemic risk issue.

Anton Ruddenklau, head of digital innovation at KPMG, explains: “Having stability in its underlying reserves is important to regulators and central banks, as a coin that was not stable, but widely used, could have massive ramifications on monetary policy.”

Mensi adds: “From a government viewpoint, there is clearly a concern about the impact on national currency and monetary policy. Libra will have a reserve, much like central banks, and will be able to create or destroy units of value, but it is not a single national currency and so will fluctuate differently to a single currency. It will be more like an index in terms of volatility and it will depend on how the underlying assets are weighted too.”

A paper by the Association of German Banks summarises the issue well: “The Libra Reserve resembles a currency board, like that operated in Hong Kong. Full backing by stable currencies can only be maintained if Libra is used only for the purpose of making payments. If loans were granted in the Libra universe, which is highly likely since it is supposed to be an open system, then money would be created. This newly created credit money would no longer have backing. This would make Libra, like any currency board, vulnerable to a bank run,” it says.

Fees and tax revenues are also an issue. Cryptocurrencies have little to no transaction costs when money is transferred across borders. The advent of a new cryptocurrency, with a potentially very large user base, has governments and traditional banks concerned. This is because Libra could herald a shift away from traditional government taxes and banking fees to a new international monetary system controlled by corporate entities like Facebook and Uber.

Finance Investing in crypto Cryptocurrencies have had their main use as an investible asset until now. According to Statista forecasts, they will grow to US$11.65bn (£9.6bn) by 2022. Compared to 2018, this would mean an increase of 468 per cent. Daniele Mensi of NextHash says that crypto and blockchain investments should be seen as a hedge – something to invest in to protect against a fall in more mainstream investments. “The way that crypto and blockchain investments react to broader market conditions is different to how mainstream investments work so they have been popular as a hedge,” he says. Whether Libra will prove to be a popular investment remains to be seen. Currently, it is not an investible asset in its own right. Its launch does, however, come at a time when Bitcoin is faltering in terms of market capitalisation: since 2015, Bitcoin’s market share has gone down by 38 per cent to only 53 per cent, which may be related to the fact that, since 2014, an increasing number of cryptocurrencies have entered the market. In addition, a trading platform specifically for cryptocurrencies has recently been launched. SmartBotCoin is intended to serve both beginners and expert traders alike. It has a real-time stream for market and portfolio updates, as well as advanced security. It is also able to process both manual and automated trading.

Half of all financial intermediation globally now happens outside the banking system, according to the Financial Stability Board. The assets of non-bank financial institutions have grown by over 50 per cent since 2008. That’s a concern on both the oversight and the revenue fronts.

Libra itself accepts that a collaborative approach is needed. Facebook’s head of Calibra, David Marcus, told the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in July that Libra is not planning to offer banking services, but he acknowledged that banking regulation would be in order if it were.

However, when asked if he would commit to refraining from moving forward with Libra until policymakers put appropriate regulations in place, Marcus replied: “I committed to waiting for us to have all the appropriate regulatory approvals and have addressed all concerns before moving forward.”

He was also asked to commit to a pilot programme to launch Libra to one million users with regulatory oversight. Marcus said that Facebook came out with this plan and a white paper prior to Libra’s full release in order to go through regulators.

Bolt, however, says that the white papers that Libra has produced don’t really answer many of the questions that the industry and the regulators have. Thus more collaboration is needed.

“The reaction of regulators differs. The US is trying to ban it, the Swiss are much more relaxed and innovative, and the UK is somewhere in between,” Bolt explains. “Libra needs to work with the various regulators to work out how to best integrate into existing systems and regulatory frameworks without introducing systemic risk.”

Regulators, however, are not the only ones having doubts in the proposed system – even a couple of partners in the association itself are having second thoughts. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, Mastercard and Visa were named as companies reconsidering their position before a meeting on 14 October with representatives from the companies involved. Furthermore, payments firm PayPal became the first member to exit Libra Association in order to focus on its own core businesses.

The Bank of England’s Future of Finance report states that private-sector ‘new finance’ will need “the right conditions to innovate and thrive. This means creating appropriate hard infrastructure and the right soft infrastructure, including a well-respected legal and judicial system, rules, regulations and standards to empower competition and ensure safety and soundness.”

The report goes on to advocate a National Payments Strategy Council to create an appropriate roadmap.

What is certain, however, is that Libra’s digital nature is likely to act as a catalyst to innovation globally within the payments arena. Obviously, banks will react to defend against disruption and new entrants will seek to find solutions to plug gaps in the current marketplace.

Bolt summarises: “This goes further than just the Libra initiative... it is obvious that something of this kind is needed within the market and that it would get the volume and the scale needed if a number of other elements, like the regulation and the stability of the coin, are resolved.”",2019-10-01,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-prediction-cryptocurrency-market-a9127336.html,"Bitcoin has experienced huge price drops in recent days, with the cryptocurrency tumbling by more than $2,000 (£1,600) to take its value below $8,000 for the first time since June.

It has since recovered slightly but many investors remain cautious about bitcoin’s short-term prospects. Others, however, remain convinced that the cryptocurrency will continue to see considerable gains before the end of the year.

Bitcoin was trading at around $4,000 at the start of 2019, having suffered prolonged losses since it reached a record high of close to $20,000 at the end of 2017.

Steady gains throughout 2019 saw bitcoin triple in price by August, before its latest crash took it back down again.

“The volatility of cryptocurrencies is what makes them excellent conduits of growth for traders, investors and growing businesses,” Daniele Mensi, CEO of digital exchange group Nexthash, told The Independent.

“What is important to remember is that bitcoin is still up around 115 per cent this year, so its short term peaks and troughs are necessary to facilitate longer-term growth across the currency.”

Noted commodity trader Peter Brandt predicted bitcoin will continue to fall until it reaches $5,500, but will then continue its upward trajectory.

In the long term, he forecasted bitcoin to be worth $50,000 – a figure seen as conservative by some cryptocurrency advocates.

Cyber security pioneer John McAfee, who has become a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, stood by a prediction he made in 2017 that bitcoin will see exponential price growth in 2019 and 2020.

“Ignore this drop in bitcoin’s price. I am firmly with Peter Brandt in his medium term $50k price prediction,” Mr McAfee tweeted.

“I am also firm on my $1m price by the end of 2020. Stop wringing your hands!”

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for bitcoin’s most recent demise, though some have said negative market sentiment can be attributed to the launch of the bitcoin futures platform Bakkt.

Pessimism surrounding Bakkt resulted in a mass sell-off, which at one point saw more than $1,000 wiped from bitcoin’s value in the space of 30 minutes.

According to U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, Jon Barry Thompson of Volantis Market Maker is accused of committing two counts each of commodities and wire fraud for false claims concerning the acquisition and sale of $7 million worth of bitcoin.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission also leveled civil charges against Thompson on Monday.

In a complaint filed earlier this summer, a grand jury alleged that Thompson defrauded two companies out of funds intended for bitcoin purchases in 2018. At the time, bitcoin traded for just under $8,000 per coin, according to Statista.

Thompson is said to have told both firms that Volantis was filed as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware, although no record exists of its registration. Volantis operated mainly out of Pennsylvania, according to the complaint.

One of the fraudulent transactions is claimed to have occurred in June and July 2018, with “Company-1” giving Thompson $3 million to facilitate tranches of bitcoin purchases. As described in the complaint, Company-1 was an over-the-counter (OTC) trade desk.

The complaint states Thompson sent the funds to a third-party escrow service which never purchased the bitcoin promised or returned the funds. Thompson repeatedly lied to Company-1 on the state of the transaction and where the bitcoin resided, saying “cash is with me, coin is with me.”

Thompson further claimed “there is no risk of default” since Volantis controlled “both sides of the transaction.”

Company-1 neither received the bitcoin promised nor had its $3 million returned, according to Attorney’s Office.

A similar story had played out earlier that year, with “Company-2,” an Irish investment firm named Symphony. In March 2018, Thompson entered into a contract with Symphony as a facilitator in a $4 million bitcoin purchase. Thompson used an undisclosed third party to facilitate the transactions, to whom he gave the capital without receiving bitcoins in return.

As with Company-1, the deal with Symphony came to a close in July 2018 with Symphony out of pocket and having received no bitcoin.

Under the state of Pennsylvania’s current commodities and wire fraud laws, Thompson could face up to 60 years in prison for all four counts.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:

“As alleged, Jon Barry Thompson repeatedly lied to investors in cryptocurrencies about the safety of their investments made through his companies. As a result of Thompson’s lies, investors lost millions of dollars.”

With international political relations becoming increasingly unstable, the global economy is once again entering dangerous waters. Traditionally, geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty push investors towards safe, stable stores-of-value like gold and other precious metals, US Treasury Bonds, real estate and currencies minted in “advanced” economies like the US, Britain, Nordic States, Japan, Switzerland or Singapore. However, in recent history, the global community has seen many of these stores-of-value fail as powerful countries struggled to keep their own domestic economies stable. As many members of the crypto-community know, the failure of these advanced economies stemmed from a systemic mismanagement of the global financial system, resulting in housing market crashes, devaluations of “stable” currencies, and a widespread loss of trust in governments and banks that ultimately lead the economy into the global financial crisis of 2007/08.

Now, with tensions rising and uncertainty rearing its ugly head once again, everyday people are turning to crypto in new and exciting ways to help insulate themselves from the systemic failures of their national governments. Let’s take a look at some of the recent geopolitical events that are not only pushing cryptocurrency valuations higher but also driving adoption like never before.

The US/China Trade War

There is a strong correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the trade war between the US and China. The reason for this correlation stems from the perception that Bitcoin is a type of “Digital Gold”, or a “Store-Of-Value” thanks to its scarcity and isolation from central banks and national economies. Since the beginning of the trade conflict in May 2019, Bitcoin trade volume has risen over 200% when compared to the same time period in 2018. This increase in BTC trade volume mirrors a 73% increase in gold trade volume, indicating the US/China trade war is pushing investors towards both assets as economic uncertainty rises globally.

The US/China trade war is showing us that BTC is beginning to function a lot more like gold as its price stabilizes. Last year, it was hard to separate the speculative bubble from the true use-case Bitcoin holds as a digital store-of-value, but now we can see a correlative trend building between gold and Bitcoin. This might be disappointing news for the “moonboys” of 2017, but it is going to serve Bitcoin well in the long term as the asset starts to identify as a true alternative to gold or other stores-of-value.

Brexit

Not only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare. / Nicholas Gregory, CEO of blockchain firm CommerceBlock, as cited by The Independent.

Much like the US/China trade war, the likelihood of a “no-deal” Brexit weighs heavily on global economic stability, giving rise to an influx of capital for Bitcoin (and gold) markets, as both are considered good “bad-weather” investments. Interestingly, this global instability is not the only favor Brexit is paying to the cryptocurrency movement. With Britain leaving the EU without a clear path ahead of either party, both the Pound and Euro are fluctuating wildly in value, making Bitcoin appear more stable as a fiat currency alternative than ever before.

For the first time since its inception, Bitcoin is now comparable to a major fiat currency in terms of volatility over an annual basis. Stability is a cornerstone for adoption, and if the global economy continues to bounce up and down as various political agendas wreak havoc on our financial security, cryptocurrencies will certainly see a surge in adoption.

Hong Kong

On Aug. 26, a prominent Hong Kong department store, Pricerite, announced it would now accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether at all its locations. The move comes on the heels of a city-wide effort by protestors to impact the economy of Hong Kong and Mainland China through creative non-violent means, most recently by renouncing the fiat currency ecosystems of both governments in favor of cryptocurrencies and US dollars.

While the surge in local crypto-adoptions has increased values of major cryptocurrencies domestically, the actions of Hong Kong protestors have not affected global price movements, as the volume is comparatively low to overall market volume. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how the political instability within the region is pushing crypto-adoption, proving that Bitcoin and its crypto-brethren are capable of providing a temporary economic “layer” for regions where the stability and security of local fiat currencies are under question.

The Petro and Senate Bill 1025

Perhaps the most interesting revelation of all is U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order to ban U.S. citizens and organizations from using the Petro, the national cryptocurrency created by the Venezuelan Government.

The Petro is an enigmatic cryptocurrency project that most experts agree is a sham. Designed to skirt US-imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan oil trade business and to secure liquidity for the Maduro administration, the Petro is a cryptocurrency token that is backed by approximately 5 billion barrels of Venezuelan crude, with each token worth one barrel of oil (about $60). While the project has met a ton of resistance from the US government and a ton of criticism from the crypto-community, Venezuela continues to push the project forward, most recently by ordering the Bank of Venezuela to open up a cryptocurrency desk to allow citizens better access to the Petro.

With such little international support for the Petro and little to no threat to the US, it is strange to see so much weight being put behind Bill 1025. The bill has more sponsors than any other blockchain-related bill being considered in the U.S, including the support of 4 U.S. Senators.

In this article by Forbes, author Michael Del Castillo and Blockchain Law Expert Jason Brett speculate that Bill 1025 is less about the Petro, and more about setting the stage to regulate cryptocurrencies in the future.

The implications for this are huge because it could be bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency inserted into this language, we’re talking about a road map for how to ban a particular cryptocurrency [in the U.S.]. / Jason Brett, founder and CEO of the Value Technology Foundation

If Castillo and Brett are right, it is easy to see why the U.S. government is building the framework needed to ban cryptocurrencies within its borders. For now, geopolitical instability is pushing everyday investors and users on-board with the crypto-movement, but with an increase in adoption comes an increase in scrutiny. Geopolitics are shaping the landscape of the cryptosphere from all angles, and investors might be insulated from the pressures of government regulation now, but it would appear that the buffer might not be as secure as it appears.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/5-educational-resources-that-will-level-up-your-cryptocurrency-knowledge/,"5 Educational Resources That Will Level up Your Cryptocurrency Knowledge

Crypto is a constant learning curve. Keeping pace with developments in bitcoin, blockchain, and the ever-evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem feels like a full-time job, and that’s just for experienced heads. For novices, it’s tough enough working out where to even start. While crypto wisdom accrues over time, there’s now an array of resources to jumpstart your bitcoin education, with some even rewarding you with tokens to sweeten the deal. Here are five of the best resources for autodidacts of all ability levels.

Tokentuber

Tokentuber is a video streaming platform making a concerted effort to better educate its audience on all things crypto. It’s formed an alliance with a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges to integrate a quiz that pays users to demonstrate their knowledge of digital assets, and to be duly rewarded with tokens and a certificate of achievement.

At the beginning of the 10-question quiz, you’re allocated 1,000 TUBER tokens, but there’s a catch – tokens will be deducted for each incorrect answer. Participants who attain pass marks will be styled as an ‘Accredited Crypto Holder,’ while for those who fail, Tokentuber will recommend further learning on its website. A quick run through of the test confirms that the questions aren’t aimed at complete novices, so if Tokentuber can match knowledge gaps with useful educational content, all the ingredients are here to effectively upskill crypto aficionados. For those who find the promise of 1,000 TUBER a little light for their tastes, participation in the quiz also offers the possibility of winning $10,000.

Tokentuber hosts third party content from original content creators on Youtube, which covers topics such as an Introduction to Bitcoin and How Does a Blockchain Work? Tokentuber aims to lower the barriers to entry to the crypto world so that mass adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be achieved.

Cointelligence Academy

In addition to providing unique market data on cryptocurrency exchanges and digital assets, Cointelligence runs free weekly seminars on all things crypto. Sessions are broadcast live on Youtube every Thursday at 4pm UTC, with an advance schedule detailing forthcoming topics. Blockchain agnostic and about as impartial as it gets, Cointelligence Academy is well worth your time.

Earn.com

Earn.com, which was purchased by Coinbase in April 2018, has ramped up its crypto focus, with many of its incentivized tasks now relating to blockchain projects and rewards paid in BTC. However, for the chance to grab more than just a few dollars of crypto at a time, Earn at Coinbase offers a range of cryptocurrency-specific courses with payment in the cryptocurrency for which the tutorial is based.

For example, the course on DAI pays $20 worth of the stablecoin for the successful completion of all modules, while the course on EOS pays $50 of EOS tokens. In most cases these rewards are spread across a number of lesson modules such as ‘Lesson 1: What is Dai?’ ($2) and ‘Lesson 2: What is DAI used for?’ ($2), so it will take time and effort to earn the full amount offered. That’s the bad news for anyone looking to earn crypto quick rather than treating the rewards as a learning bonus, but the site is currently offering up to $130 of payments across a number of tutorials and currencies, making it one of the most lucrative learning opportunities in the cryptosphere right now.

Binance Academy

Binance Academy is the educational division of Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Unlike Token Tuber, Binance Academy has not gamified this content to incentivize participation, but instead offers it as a free resource. Content has been sorted into five categories: blockchain, security, economics, tutorials and video, and is characterized by deep, original research complemented by clean presentation that aids learning. Another neat feature of Binance Academy is that every article comes with an estimated time to read as well as an audio transcript. The audio transcript is clearly computer generated, but the technology is sophisticated enough that the synthetic voice isn’t overly distracting.

Captain Bitcoin

Similar in concept to Token Tuber, Captain Bitcoin hosts video content and offers financial rewards for the completion of designated tasks. In the case of Captain Bitcoin, those rewards are activated by a referral competition, boosting the profile of the site toward its target of 100k users before launch. Right now Captain Bitcoin is offering $15,000 in BTC for users who help to build the community as well as 1,000 captain tokens for each successful referral.

In future, the site intends to give away $1,000 in BTC daily, with users qualifying by watching at least two videos every day. At the moment, the site is in its pre-launch phase, so it isn’t currently possible to stake a claim to the prize pot, since the required video content does not yet exist. As it stands, Captain Bitcoin remains an intriguing concept that could incentivize greater content engagement while boosting learning.

Bitcoin.com

If you’re looking for a no-nonsense introduction to cryptocurrency that gets you up and running as quickly as possible, Bitcoin.com has a wealth of useful resources. From A quick introduction to bitcoin to How do I easily buy and sell Bitcoin? the lessons and tutorials will provide the knowledge you need to safely buy and store crypto and participate in the digital economy.

For developers, Bitcoin.com is equally instructional, providing tools and support to develop products on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. This opens the possibility of creating censorship-resistant applications, as well blockchain commerce options, while providing a range of educational resources specifically aimed at developers.

Lifelong Learning

Whether you’re a bitcoin novice or a cryptocurrency enthusiast looking to smooth over any gaps in your knowledge, there are some great wells of information to draw upon. While the long-term reward derived from exploring these resources is to make you richer in knowledge, a little short-term enrichment of the pocket won’t hurt either. Happy learning.

You wouldn’t expect a traditional financial institution to come up with a very optimistic forecast about the future of a cryptocurrency or an honest appraisal of its design. But Bayern LB, a lender based in the rich German province of Bavaria, has surprised the crypto community. In a recently published research paper, the bank asks a rather rhetorical question: “Is Bitcoin outshining gold?” and predicts a tenfold increase in BTC’s price by the spring, when the next bitcoin block reward halving takes place.

Measuring the ‘Hardness’ of a Crypto Asset

Comparing the first cryptocurrency with the oldest precious metal, the report titled “Megatrend Digitalisation” focuses on the commodity-market analysis, and in particular the stock-to-flow approach which serves to measure the “hardness” of an asset. “Applied to Bitcoin, an unusually strong correlation emerges between the market value of this cryptocurrency and the ratio between existing stockpiles of Bitcoin (stock) and new supply (flow),” the authors note.

On the backdrop of even looser monetary policies by central banks and ever lower, subzero interest rates, the attractiveness of gold, the traditional store of value, is growing again, as is its price. Its appeal, the Munich-headquartered bank points out, stems from the fact that the supply side cannot be increased indiscriminately. And at the same time, the limited annual production of new gold, the flow, only adds incrementally to an already very substantial stockpile, the stock.

The article emphasizes that gold has a high stock-to-flow ratio and a price increase won’t lead to significantly higher production that would be a threat to its price. What sets bitcoin apart is that whereas gold needed millennia to achieve its high ratio, the digital design of the crypto, as “an ultra-hard type of money,” has allowed its supply to be engineered in a way that causes its stock-to-flow ratio to rise much faster. It is likely to reach values comparable to those of the gold’s ratio as early as next year.

BTC to Reach Gold’s Stock-to-Flow Ratio

In order to demonstrate that the market value of bitcoin can be explained by a stock-to-flow model, the researchers have collated the number of created bitcoins (BTC) and the available historical price data from cryptocurrency exchanges. Then they have established that bitcoin core’s market value increases in a linear fashion as the stock-to-flow ratio rises.

“The harder Bitcoin is, the greater the value,” Bayern LB’s experts conclude. Just like gold, but unlike other precious metals with alternative utility value such as palladium, demand for bitcoin is due to its monetary qualities as a store of value and means of exchange, and not because it’s subject to other uses, industrial for example.

The paper stresses that Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is set to increase significantly after the upcoming BTC block reward halving in May 2020, from approximately 26 now, to 53. The indicator will almost catch up with that of gold, which is currently around 58 but is expected to change insignificantly by next spring.

“If the May 2020 stock-to-flow ratio for Bitcoin is factored into the model, a vertiginous price of around USD 90,000 emerges,” the Bayerische Landesbank’s analysts predict. “This would imply that the forthcoming halving effect has hardly been priced into the current Bitcoin price of approximately USD 8,000,” the German bankers remark.

In April 2018, the country’s central bank cut off the community’s ties with the financial system by barring banks from dealing with crypto exchanges. In July this year, an inter-ministerial panel, set up to study bitcoins, led by the top bureaucrat Subhash Chandra Garg, recommended imprisonment for those who even hold cryptocoins.

Yet, a steering committee report by the finance ministry, released in September, recommended a softer approach, citing the importance of blockchain technology, which powers cryptocurrencies, to fintech.

The uncertainty arising from the lack of a legal framework for the sector has taken its toll. It is important to take a fresh look at bitcoin, and see it not just as a cryptocurrency, but also a computer network and a technology protocol.

Three interpretations

As crypto investor Meltem Demirors recently argued before the US Congress, in a hearing on Facebook’s Libra, bitcoin is a store of value—a digital gold of sorts. Despite its volatility, it is being used as a medium of exchange in places such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Zimbabwe.

Its true nature, though, goes beyond that.

Bitcoin is an open source technology protocol, not controlled by a single entity. In that sense, it resembles some of the more enduring vignettes of our times, such as Wikipedia or, arguably, the Linux operating system.

Cryptocurrencies can also be thought of as a network formed by computers running this open source code. This network’s computing power is 72 million TH/s (trillion hashes per second). To put that in perspective, the computing power of Google’s 10 million servers would be less than 1% of this.

It is their brute computing power that makes bitcoins uncensorable, inviolable, and ultimately, valuable.

Given these three ways to interpret bitcoins, the pertinent question is: what exactly should India’s regulators be regulating?

Apart from some anodyne lip service to blockchain technology, are policymakers trying to clearly parse out the distinction between the currency, the technology, and the network?

The Garg panel’s document seemed to be exclusively concerned with bitcoin as a cryptocurrency, and its destabilising effect on monetary policy. To be sure, these are valid concerns, and there are no easy, near-term answers.

Yet, the Indian government would do well to keep in mind the other two perspectives on bitcoin, which has inspired many to invest in cryptocoins.

Frenetic investments

In the period between the first quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2019, venture capital funds worth over $6.2 billion was poured into over 400 companies in this space, most of them in the US.

The top 10 unicorns in this space, led by Binance and Coinbase, are collectively worth around $50 billion, and companies built on top of the bitcoin protocol collectively employ hundreds of thousands of the sharpest business and technology minds globally.

Large corporations such as Facebook, Google, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are investing heavily in research and developmental efforts in this space. Institutions such as MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley are also emerging as leading centers of bitcoin research.

The important thing is, these efforts are not just focused on bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. They are looking at making the bitcoin network more scalable and more reliable so that people can send money to each other faster, corporations can settle international transactions more efficiently, participants in a supply chain can collaborate to make it more efficient, and some of the most disenfranchised people in the world can access financial services in a safe, secure, and convenient manner.

The current stifling of crypto enthusiasts in India will only hasten the exodus of some of the sharpest minds to global centers like Singapore, San Francisco, and Berlin—cities where they are likely to be welcomed with open arms, funding, and a friendly regulatory framework.

Digital rupee

India’s Garg panel had also recommended that India must consider introducing an official virtual currency, the “Digital Rupee,” to replace private cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.

This is an impractical idea.

For one, there is the infrastructure hurdle. Some entity (usually from the private sector) needs to invest heavily to build out the payment gateways and the user and exchange interfaces that will be needed to drive adoption of a crypto rupee.

The public sector has limited resources to develop virtual currencies.

The public sector has limited resources to develop or manage projects at this scale. Most Indian governmental websites still use the older, insecure, HTTP protocol without the SSL encryption. A wallet to store the proposed crypto rupee, for instance, would be considered highly unsafe, and find little traction.

Designing and developing critical components and building blocks like these is typically best left to motivated, young, geeky engineers congregating in hacker houses in Powai and Palo Alto, than to an army of ‘for-rent’ consultants hired by the government’s IT department through archaic tendering processes.

Some have termed cryptocurrencies as the “Wild West” of the financial world. Terrorists, pornographers, and money launderers can misuse it.

However, living in fear is to lose the battle to the neo-luddites and the rentiers reluctant to change the status quo. Given that bitcoin is here to stay globally, we might as well consider a progressive approach to a sector that is nascent, evolving rapidly and has transformational potential.

The importance of crypto to protesters

Hong Kong is now one of the biggest hotspots of civil unrest in the world. Protests and tensions have been inflamed by the recently proposed legislation that would make it possible for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to mainland China. The fear is that local Hong Kong people and visitors would be effectively placed under Chinese jurisdiction, which undermines the autonomy of Hong Kong and it’s citizen’s rights.

Having been a British colony for over 150 years until 1997, Hong Kong still models it’s legal system on the British one, valuing transparency, democracy, and due process. This stance gave rise to the “one country, two systems” policy which recognized that Hong Kong was different from mainland China and that Hong Kong Basic Law would trump laws made on the mainland for 50 years after the handover. All this was an attempt to protect Hong Kong’s democracy, the right to protest, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. These rights are taken for granted in the West, however, they are rights that the mainland Chinese simply do not enjoy.

Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens have decided to take to the streets to protest the infringement of their democratic rights, autonomy, freedom of speech and of the press. What’s clear is that the Hong Kong people will not become subservient to Beijing without a fight and, sadly, peaceful protest has led to violent suppression.

The eyes of the world are now on Hong Kong and China.

The Censorship

Although the hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong protesters made international news headlines on the 9th of June 2019, the Chinese media remained silent. Instead, the Chinese government censored online posts and media on popular Chinese social platforms like Weibo and WeChat containing keywords like “Hong Kong”, “Hong Kong government,” “1.03 million (the number of alleged protesters) and the names of areas where the protesters marched.

The Chinese government then decided to run a creative media campaign of its own, claiming that:

The protesters were violent extremists who were in the pockets of the West.

There was widespread support for China in Hong Kong and for the police attempting to clamp down on the protests.

Hong Kong needs to be reminded of the military might of China.

Hong Kong is part of China.

Hong Kong citizens defaced and vandalized China’s liaison office in Hong Kong, with the Chinese publication People’s Daily responding with an editorial saying that “the central authority will not be challenged.” Bejing had seemingly decided to try and take control over the narrative with more than 160,000 Weibo users using the hashtag #TheCentralAuthorityWillNotBeChallenged.

On the 21st of July, groups of men wearing white t-shirts were spotted in Hong Kong beating protesters. This story was leveraged by the Chinese government to portray a narrative of good versus evil. Pro-Chinese Facebook and Twitter accounts were then activated in an attempt to spread the Chinese narrative internationally. Both Twitter and Facebook claimed to have suspended accounts which they believed were distributing state-backed misinformation.

The battle for ownership of the Hong Kong narrative even spilled over to Telegram (a messaging app used by huge swaths of the crypto community). Telegram was attacked by Chinese servers in a denial-of-service attempt. Chinese protesters using Telegram were also monitored and some even found themselves arrested for sending pro-Hong Kong messages through Telegram.

Facial recognition towers have also been installed in Hong Kong to help the Chinese government monitor who took part in the protests. Hong Kong citizens reacted by vandalizing these state-backed monitoring systems.

Why Does Hong Kong Show That Censorship Resistance Matters?

The protests in Hong Kong show that technologically advanced states can leverage centralized technology to censor, monitor and intimidate their own people. This is particularly alarming when it comes to monitoring messaging apps like Telegram and using that data to target and arrest people. Indeed, many Hong Kong protesters refused to use centralized payment methods like the state-issued Octopus card to pay for public transport due to fears that this would leave a data trail for the government to arrest them for participating in the protests.

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been designed to be censorship-resistant and be free of any intervening hand of governments. Put simply, no government can freeze the account of any decentralized cryptocurrency and it’s exceptionally hard for governments to monitor the transactions of their citizens. Indeed, many cryptocurrencies are working towards making transactions even more anonymous and this is particularly important in an age where people may wish to remain anonymous and free from the monitoring of centralized governments.

The Hong Kong protesters seem to have recognized the value in censorship-resistant

money that’s hard for even the Chinese government to tie to a person’s identity. Indeed, crypto adoption seems to be skyrocketing in Hong Kong right now with:

Bitcoin trading at a premium of over $160 on Hong Kong exchanges like TideBit.

ATM provider, Genesis Block, distributing water bottles and umbrellas to Hong Kong protesters with QR codes to fund additional supplies for protesters.

The growth in acceptance of crypto as a payment method in Hong Kong-based stores.

Admittedly anyone reading this article is probably thousands of miles from Hong Kong. However, do you really trust your government? Though it is tempting to deny the possibility of oppression happening to those of us fortunate enough to live with liberty, the truth is that anything happening in this world to other people could also happen to you. It is easy for governments to brand legitimate protesters as extremists and potentially freeze all your bank accounts or monitor your transactions and use that data trial to arrest you later. That’s why if you believe in freedom, self-sovereignty, and freedom of speech, you should consider crypto’s censorship-resistance as one of its most important attributes. If this is not a real-world use-case, then what is?

The Old Fallacy of ‘If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear’

When it comes to censorship-resistance and privacy, many in the mainstream argue that there is nothing to worry about if you have done nothing wrong. It’s a persuasive argument. However, the problem is that it assumes that centralized authorities like governments will always act fairly.

Yes, it is true that some people use cryptocurrency for money laundering and criminal activities and this is often used to give crypto a bad reputation among the mainstream. However, the truth is that significantly more ‘bad guys’ use state-backed fiat currencies like the USD. The current problems in Hong Kong also go to show that not everyone wanting to process semi-anonymous payments or wanting censorship resistance is acting nefariously.

Sure, if you think that taking away power from potentially oppressive governments is a bad thing, then censorship resistance is not for you. However, one of the key powers of crypto is that it provides an alternative, non-state backed means of payment. It is semi-anonymous and can play a key role in curbing governments leveraging technology to monitor and censor their own people. Having a viable hedge against government oppression is surely worth something and is why we think that censorship-resistance is one of the most underrated benefits of cryptocurrencies. Indeed, it may even be wise for everyone to have crypto as an insurance policy in place to protect you against a scenario like in Hong Kong.

How Safe Is Your Financial Data?

Financial control and surveillance are one of the major pitfalls of the traditional banking sector. Sure, there are legal standards and business processes in most developed countries to try and prevent the abusive use of all this financial data. Most governments take breaches of privacy data very seriously and can impose fines and lawsuits against incompetent data handlers.

Currently, most people in first-world democracies appear to be comfortable with the level of privacy offered by the current system. However, the rise of far-right politicians around the world could perhaps be seen as a warning shot of changing times. The progress made by far-right parties such as Italy’s Lega Nord party, the French National Rally party and Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán are all examples of this increasing political polarization.

It is tempting to be complacent about the need for censorship resistance until you abruptly find yourself in a situation like Hong Kong. With a rapidly changing world and rapidly shifting governmental politics, it could be wise to start questioning how safe your financial data actually is and re-examining the value that censorship-resistance has and the hedge that it offers everyone.

Is This the Most Censorship Resistant Crypto?

Decentralization and censorship-resistance are the guiding principles upon which many cryptocurrencies have been built upon. Naturally, the main cryptocurrency that springs to mind is Bitcoin and whilst it is exceptionally censorship-resistant, it is arguably not the most censorship-resistant crypto out there. This is because Bitcoin requires a node, operated by a third party, in order for you to broadcast a transaction over the network. All this means is that to make a Bitcoin transaction, the chances are you are dependent on Bitcoin miners with huge amounts of computing power to process your transaction for you. This is because most average computers are simply not powerful enough to process transactions in any reasonable time-frame. All this means is that even Bitcoin transactions are dependent on third parties who could theoretically censor transactions.

However, an under the radar cryptocurrency called Nimiq actually solves this issue and can be considered even more decentralized and censorship-resistant than Bitcoin. This is because Nimiq users don’t need a node, operated by a third party, in order to broadcast a transaction to the network and can instead do this directly. All this is made possible by Nimiq’s unique architecture, which was built from the ground up specifically with decentralization in mind. The result is Nimiq being perhaps the most censorship-resistant and decentralized cryptocurrency out there right now and means that Nimiq users have complete control over their funds and that no oppressive state can enforce financial restrictions or confiscate funds.

Maybe you do not live in the shadow of an authoritarian government or think you face the same dangers as the citizens of Hong Kong. However, you only have to look at recent history to see that financial oppression has happened in the West and could happen again at any time. In 2013, during the Cypriot banking crisis, citizens woke up to find that 47.5 percent of their savings had been confiscated by the state on deposits above €100,000. In total, the Cypriot government had stolen €4 billion from their citizens to prop up the country’s ailing banks. If that was not bad enough, the government also imposed severe restrictions on cash withdrawals to try and prevent a run on the local banks.

The lesson is that it is easy to believe that your government will not financially oppress you until it’s too late. Maybe spend a little time on Google and look at how much national debt your country actually has and the strength of the banks that you store funds in. If you have any worry about what your government may do in the future, then Nimiq’s extraordinary levels of decentralization and censorship-resistance could make it one of the best ways to protect your financial sovereignty.

What Is Nimiq?

Nimiq is a cryptocurrency native to the web which is focused on ushering a new era of censorship-resistant money. It is also home to a diverse ecosystem of apps all aiming to make it easy for both technical and non-tech savvy users to adopt the Nimiq payment system.

In short, Nimiq is all about staying true to the ideals of decentralization and censorship-resistance, whilst building a cryptocurrency from the ground up that is capable of being mass adopted by everyone. This is seen throughout the project in its simple user interfaces, which all aim to take the complication out of crypto and make things easy for normal people.

Nimiq has also adopted a browser-first approach for its blockchain, which makes the NIM token native to the web. That word salad just means that you can use Nimiq in your web browser without any annoying downloads or integrations. The value here is ease of use and giving users that ‘it just works’ experience. It’s a bit like the benefits of using Google Docs over traditional Word software.

Scalability is one of the biggest problems in crypto right now. All this means is that a payment network like Nimiq cannot be mass adopted unless it can process an adequate number of transactions per second. Think about how annoying it would be if you went to a supermarket, paid in crypto and had to wait an hour for your transaction to go through. With widely used traditional payment systems like PayPal, we all know transactions take a matter of seconds and this is thanks to the scalability of these payment networks. The problem for crypto payment systems like Bitcoin is that they can only currently process 7 transactions per second, whilst the likes of PayPal process an average of 193 per second.

Nimiq has decided to tackle the scalability issue plaguing cryptocurrency by teaming up with Trinkler Software, led by Forbes 30 Under 30 winner Reto Trinkler. Together they have devised a new technical paper for a new proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Albatross. Incredibly, the initial findings of this research show that Albatross is theoretically capable of hitting the maximum speed possible for a single-chain blockchain. Nimiq plans to integrate Albatross into Nimiq 2.0 and that could see Nimiq being home to the fastest single-chain blockchain in the world, with a speed of 1,000+ transactions per second.

Conclusion

The recent Hong Kong protests are perhaps one of the best current examples in the world showcasing the true value of censorship-resistance and how technology can be leveraged by governments to monitor and oppress populations.

Decentralized and censorship-resistant cryptocurrencies offer everyone an alternative counter-measure against nanny states, intrusive financial monitoring, and oppression. That’s surely something very valuable, even if it just acts as a hedge and a technology to help keep governments honest. Indeed, censorship-resistance could turn out to be the most underrated and most valuable attribute of cryptocurrencies.

That’s why censorship-resistance matters in crypto and why the people of Hong Kong appear to be embracing crypto on a scale never seen before.

What’s the world’s most widely used cryptocurrency? If you think it’s Bitcoin , which accounts for about 70% of all the digital-asset world’s market value, you’re probably wrong.While concrete figures on trading volumes are hard to come by in this often murky corner of finance, data from CoinMarketCap.com show that the token with the highest daily and monthly trading volume is Tether , whose market capitalization is more than 30 times smaller. Tether’s volume surpassed that of Bitcoin’s for the first time in April and has consistently exceeded it since early August at about $21 billion per day, the data provider says.With Tether’s monthly trading volume about 18% higher than that of Bitcoin, it’s arguably the most important coin in the crypto ecosystem. Tether’s also one of the main reasons why regulators regard cryptocurrencies with a wary eye, and have put the breaks on crypto exchange-traded funds amid concern of market manipulation.“If there is no Tether, we lose a massive amount of daily volume -- around $1 billion or more depending on the data source,” said Lex Sokolin, global financial technology co-head at ConsenSys , which offers blockchain technology. “Some of the concerning potential patters of trading in the market may start to fall away.”Tether is the world’s most used stablecoin, a category of tokens that seek to avoid price fluctuations, often through pegs or reserves. It’s also a pathway for most of the world’s active traders into the crypto market. In countries like China, where crypto exchanges are banned, people can pay cash over the counter to get Tethers with few questions asked, according to Sokolin. From there, they can trade Tethers for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he said.“For many people in Asia, they like the idea that it’s this offshore, opaque thing out of reach of the U.S. government,” said Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle, which supports a rival stablecoin called USD Coin. “It’s a feature, not a problem.”Tether, which is being sued by New York for allegedly commingling funds including reserves, says using a know-your-customer form and approval process is required to issue and redeem the coin.Asian traders account for about 70% of all crypto trading volume, according to Allaire, and Tether was used in 40% and 80% of all transactions on two of the world’s top exchanges, Binance and Huobi, respectively, Coin Metrics said earlier this year.Many people don’t even know they use Tether, said Thaddeus Dryja, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Because traditional financial institutions worry that they don’t sniff out criminals and money launderers well enough, most crypto exchanges still don’t have bank accounts and can’t hold dollars on behalf of customers. So they use Tether as a substitute, Dryja said.“I don’t think people actually trust Tether -- I think people use Tether without realizing that they are using it, and instead think they have actual dollars in a bank account somewhere,” Dryja said. Some exchanges mislabel their pages, to convey the impression that customers are holding dollars instead of Tethers, he said.The way Tether is managed and governed makes it a black box. While Bitcoin belongs to no one, Tether is issued by a Hong Kong-based private company whose proprietors also own the Bitfinex crypto exchange. The exact mechanism by which Tether’s supply is increased and decreased is unclear. Exactly how much of the supply is covered by fiat reserves is in question, too, as Tether is not independently audited. In April, Tether disclosed that 74% of the Tethers are covered by cash and short-term securities, while it previously said it had a 100% reserve.The disclosure was a part of an ongoing investigation into Tether by the New York Attorney General, which accused the companies behind the coin of a coverup to hide the loss of $850 million of comingled client and corporate funds.John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that half of Bitcoin’s runup in 2017 was the result of market manipulation using Tether. Last year Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Justice Department is investigating Tether’s role in this market manipulation.“Being controlled by centralized parties defeats the entire original purpose of blockchain and decentralized cryptocurrencies,” Griffin said. “By avoiding government powers, stablecoins place trust instead in the hands of big tech companies, who have mixed accountability. So while the idea is great in theory, in practice it is risky, open to abuse, and plagued by similar problems to traditional fiat currencies.”On the other hand, because Tether is key to their growth, many crypto exchanges would likely be willing to bail it out if needed, said Dan Raykhman, who is developing a platform for issuing digital assets and used to be head of trading technologies for Galaxy Digital.“There’s this implicit support from all these exchanges to help Tether stay afloat,” he said.While dozens of stablecoins have come out in the past year, many of them independently audited and regulated, Tether remains the favorite, by far.“Tether has been around since 2014 -- ancient antecedents in crypto --and has retained its value,” said Aaron Brown, an investor and a writer for Bloomberg Opinion. “I don’t say it’s perfect, but its convenience outweighs its risk for many people.”",,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/the-great-delisting-why-crypto-exchanges-are-dropping-assets/,"The “crypto winter” that the industry experienced through most of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 forced cryptocurrency to rethink its priorities. The same industry that had onboarded hundreds of thousands–perhaps millions–of new investors in 2017 was faced with declining prices, declining interest, and declining trading volume.

This led to a “purge” of sorts–coins, platforms, and other parts of the industry that weren’t competitive in a more mature market seemed to “die” away naturally. While the list of cryptocurrencies is longer than it has ever been, coins that have been proven unreliable or extraneous are much more likely to fail or have failed already.

As such, savvy cryptocurrency exchanges have decided to delist cryptocurrencies that have failed to gain adequate attention or usage or have been associated with illicit behavior. In other cases, however, cryptocurrencies have been delisted for reasons that are not quite as ethically clear or sound.

What are the main causes of delisting cryptocurrencies? What are the ethics of delisting? And what happens after?

The BSV debacle: when crypto gets personal

Perhaps the most famous–and most ethically ambiguous–example of delisting in the crypto space has to do with Bitcoin SV (BSV), the cryptocurrency known to be created by the self-proclaimed creator of the original Bitcoin (BTC), Craig Wright.

A bit of background information: several years ago, Wright began publicly claiming that he was the individual behind the pseudonym “Satoshi Nakamoto,” and that he had authored the Bitcoin whitepaper that was published in 2008.

However, a number of experts within the space have agreed that there is a serious lack of any substantial evidence behind this claim–Wright has not been able to prove that any of the BTC wallets that were known to be under Satoshi Nakamoto’s control have been in his possession at any time; he also was found to have forged documents in a recent court case in an attempt to prove his status as Satoshi.

Wright’s claims to be the creator of the original Bitcoin were largely ignored by most of the industry until November of 2018 when a dispute between Wright and Bitcoin ABC (the group of individuals behind the Bitcoin Cash Protocol) led to an epic battle of computing power. Essentially, both Wright and Bitcoin ABC attempted to impose their software updates to the Bitcoin Cash protocol; Bitcoin ABC eventually won, and Wright’s update became a separate cryptocurrency: Bitcoin SV.

The real trouble started in April of this year when Wright began going after high-profile individuals in the cryptocurrency industry who publicly denied his claims that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. He sued at least three people who denied he was Satoshi for libel: the individual behind @HodlNaut (a popular cryptocurrency-related Twitter account), cryptocurrency podcaster Peter McCormack, and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.

The delistings came as a direct result of the lawsuits. The idea to delist BSV appears to have originated with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who Tweeted on Friday, April 12th, that “Craig Wright is not Satoshi. Anymore of this sh!t, we delist! (sic)”

BSV was off of the exchange by the following Monday.

In a statement on the delisting, Binance representatives wrote that “we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect. When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it.”

After Binance delisted, a number of other exchanges followed suit: Kraken chucked BSV after a user poll said that it was “toxic”; Shapeshift, Bittylicious, Blockchain, and more came next.

The people have spoken. Kraken is delisting BitcoinSV: https://t.co/8lSUfEYUYr#delistBSV — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) April 16, 2019

But ethical questions quickly arose: if BSV was to be delisted, who was really affected the most–the creator or the users? And is the behavior of any single individual in the crypto space really enough cause to delist?

Jimmy Nguyen, BSV supporter and president of the BSV-focused Bitcoin Association, told Finance Magnates that the delistings “[set] a terrible precedent for the cryptocurrency industry for an exchange to use its CEO’s personal dislike of a coin’s individual supporter as a basis to make delisting decisions.”

“What if one day Vitalik Buterin or Charlie Lee took personal actions that offended an exchange CEO? Should that be the basis for delisting Ethereum or Litecoin?” he asked.

Indeed, while Wright’s actions were questionable, Nguyen cautioned on the precedent that the delistings set for the industry: “cryptocurrency enthusiasts should not be cheering a precedent which can make all cryptocurrencies vulnerable to easy market manipulation and heavily influenced by just a few people at notable exchanges. Whether you agree with Craig Wright’s personal legal actions or not, those issues are for a court of law to decide – not crypto exchanges.”

In the US, regulatory pressure has caused delistings

But not every case of delisting is so ethically ambiguous. Indeed, one of the most popular reasons behind a number of recent delisting seems to be very practical: regulatory pressure in various jurisdictions around the globe is causing an increasing amount of exchanges to drop some of their assets.

One of the most prominent examples of this is the United States. After an increase in regulatory attention on cryptocurrency exchanges, restructuring has occurred on a number of different levels.

US-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex announced in May of this year that it would be axing nine trading pairs due to regulatory uncertainties in the United States. The exchange’s concerns seemed to focus specifically around whether or not certain cryptocurrencies could be classified as securities:

2/ Recent guidance from US regulators on what crypto assets would be deemed securities has led to these actions. We don’t agree that they should be considered securities but need to ensure we are in compliance with US law. — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) May 16, 2019

]Then, in June, US-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex announced that it would be blocking US-based customers’ access to 21 different assets, with a possibility of more to come: ‘Certain markets will soon become unavailable to U.S. Customers, a statement said. “Those markets will generally continue to be available to Bittrex International customers. Currently, Bittrex International features 200+ tokens and coins for non-US Customers and we anticipate that we will continue to add innovative blockchain projects to Bittrex International in the future.”

Update: Market availability changes for U.S. customers. US customers will have access to a limited number of markets moving forward. Like other industry participants, we will continue to advocate for laws and regulations that foster innovation.

Binance didn’t exactly block US customers from accessing certain assets on the exchange–it went one further. Citing regulatory concerns, Binance completely shut down US-based users’ access to its main exchange and opened an entirely new exchange for US users.

FATF guidelines have caused delistings in South Korea

In South Korea, OKEx and Upbit said over the course of the last several weeks that they would be delisting five privacy-focused coins in order to comply with the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) new guidelines on cryptocurrency transactions and customer identity information.

On September 10th, OKEx axed Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR), Super Bitcoin (SBTC), Horizen (ZEN), and Zcash (ZEC), writing in an announcement that “according to the statement corresponding to FATF R.16, OKEx Korea has restricted its implementation as the ‘travel rule’ recommends that exchanges be able to collect relevant information such as the name and address of the sender and recipient of the virtual asset.” (Translated quote.)

The exchange explained that “privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies, aka ‘dark coins,’” made it difficult for the exchange to effectively follow the FATF’s guidelines.

Two weeks later, Upbit made a similar announcement. Although it did not specifically cite the FATF’s new guidelines, the proximity to OKEx’s decision to drop several privacy coins may imply that the decision was made for a similar reason. The exchange dropped Monero, Zcash, Dash, Haven, BitTube, and PIVX, explaining that “the decision to end trading support for the crypto-asset was also made to block the possibility of money laundering and inflow from external networks.”

While there haven’t been any other instances of delisting associated with the FATF’s guidelines, there could be more as the January compliance deadline continues to draw closer.

Lack of liquidity

In some cases, exchanges have not gone so far as to completely delist an asset, but have instead slimmed down on the number of trading pairs that they offer due to a lack of liquidity.

On September 30th, Binance announced that it would be delisting thirty trading pairs, including six involving tokens that were released through its very own Launchpad program, and one involving Tron’s much-hyped BitTorrent Token.

In the announcement of the delistings, the exchange explained that it had made the decision to delist “to improve liquidity and user trading experience among our wide range of available assets.”

Just over a month before Binance announced its delistings, Poloniex announced that it would be dropping 23 of its trading pairs due to a lack of liquidity.

The following pairs will be removed: LTC/XMR, DASH/XMR, ZEC/XMR, MAID/XMR, NXT/XMR, BCN/XMR, LSK/ETH, GNT/ETH, MANA/ETH, QTUM/ETH, STEEM/ETH, OMG/ETH, LOOM/ETH, SNT/ETH, CVC/ETH, KNC/ETH, GAS/ETH, BNT/ETH, LOOM/USDT, SNT/USDT, KNC/USDT, BNT/USDT, FOAM/USDC — Poloniex Exchange (@Poloniex) August 15, 2019

While dropping a trading pair is certainly not as severe as dropping an asset entirely, the drop in liquidity could have an effect on an asset’s price.

Pay up or get out

In some cases, cryptocurrencies have claimed that they were delisted after failing to pay large sums of money or agree to participate in wash trading to make their volumes appear higher.

Specifically, Bitcoin Gold (BTG) said in an announcement on September 1st, 2018 that “Bittrex has decided to de-list BTG after we declined to pay them 12,372 BTG to remain listed.’ Bittrex claimed to have made its decision to delist BTG “based on a double-spend attack they suffered back on May 19th [2018], despite all our efforts to assist them, and despite the fact that the danger is now over.”

BTG explained that “Bittrex informed us that they make this decision because the BTG team would not “take responsibility for our chain,” and that taking responsibility meant paying Bittrex 12,372 BTG to cover the loss they incurred. They later informed us they would cover part of the loss from their own BTG reserves and requested we pay the remaining ~6000 BTG, and that if we did not, we would be delisted.”

Rahul Sood, CEO of UnikoinGold, tweeted that OKEx told his company that UnikoinGold would be delisted if it didn’t artificially increase its trading volume. OKEx was also recently accused by the Blockchain Transparency Institute of having a high volume of wash trading on its platform.

OKEX straight up asked us to increase volume by any means necessary or get delisted. Wonder why the SEC won’t approve ETFs? 🤔 Sry OKEX we’d rather focus on our business not yours. @SilvioSchembri @JosephMuscat_JM this is why 🇲🇹 needs to be very selective.

What happens after a delisting?

Regardless of the reason, a delisting is never good news for a cryptocurrency. After all, the less available a coin is, the smaller the capital can flow into that coin’s market.

Additionally, traders may find themselves between a rock and a hard place: either forced to sell all of their holdings of the delisted asset, or to take pains to move them onto another exchange or OTC platform where they can still be traded: ‘if you want to transact with the asset in the future you’ll need to make sure that you have an account on an exchange that supports it, go through an OTC desk, or direct trade with a trusted party who has an interest in buying/selling it,” wrote Megan Knab, Founder & CEO of VeriLedger, in a Medium post.

But delisting may not necessarily be the end of the world for a cryptocurrency. Jimmy Nguyen told Finance Magnates of the BSV delistings that “certainly, it was a dramatic event at the time, and we were not pleased that it happened.”

Ultimately, though, the network seems to be doing fine: “BSV’s price took an immediate hit when that happened, but it’s recovered, and it’s higher than it was at the time of the delistings,” which Nguyen said he believes is because of “the organic value that’s being built and demonstrated on the network over time.”

Therefore, it seems as though a cryptocurrency’s value is not perhaps solely–or even primarily–defined by its availability; instead, perhaps a cryptocurrency’s value is ultimately determined by its ability to roll with the punches.",2019-10-02 07:23:37+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/ripples-xpring-launches-crypto-fiat-payments-that-integrate-into-any-app,"Ripple’s Xpring is launching a platform it says makes it possible for developers to integrate fiat and cryptocurrency payments into any application.

The suite of services includes an Xpring software development kit (SDK) that allows programmers to integrate XRP apps in multiple programming languages. It also includes a variety of new tools for working on both XRP and Ripple’s Interledger Protocol (ILP).

Xpring is targeting crypto and non-crypto developers alike with the platform, Xpring senior vice president Ethan Beard told CoinDesk.

“Xpring SDK allows you the developer to use the XRP ledger simply and in any programming language you want,” Beard said, adding:

“What takes a developer today a 100 lines of code to do a transaction on XRP ledger, using Xpring SDK cuts that down by 80 percent.”

Xpring has already been built on open-source protocols, but this platform would function like Amazon Web Services, Beard said. Developers could download the code and run it themselves, or now they can go to Xpring and plug into the service.

Beard envisions the platform being used to enable micropayments in industries like media and gaming.

“Ideally, we think the Xpring platform can work for any type of payment,” Beard said.

The platform is a new vertical for Xpring, which has been an investment arm for Ripple – building a network of companies and use-cases around XRP for little over a year. This initiative is aimed at investing in and growing a developer base around the cryptocurrency.

“While blockchain and cryptocurrency can be transformative for how payments work, what we’ve learned in the last year is that working with these new technologies is quite difficult as well,” Beard said. “That creates a barrier for developers to adopt these technologies.”

As a part of the announcement, Xpring is also announcing that payments processor BitPay, mobile wallet BRD and digital custody provider Anchorage are all adding XRP to their offerings. With BitPay on board, the company anticipates users being able to use XRP for everyday purchases at thousands of merchants, including Microsoft and AT&T.

Furthermore, Chainalysis is adding the XRP ledger to its blockchain analytics product.

For bitcoin, though, it’s a different story.

The U.S. Institute of Supply Management said Tuesday its manufacturing index fell to a 10-year low of 47.8 percent last month from 49.1 percent in August. A below-50 reading indicates contraction in manufacturing activity.

The gloomy data suggests a boosted risk of a recession in 2020, as seen in the chart below tweeted by popular analyst Holger Zschaepitz.

The probability of the U.S. economy falling into a recession next year is now greater than 40 percent.

The Treasury yield curve (U.S. bonds) is pricing in a 60 percent chance of recession, according to the JPMorgan data.

The threat of a recession has sent global equities lower. Notably, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 450 points in day two of a sell-off.

Meanwhile, gold has risen from $1,460 to $1,500 per ounce in the last 48 hours and is now looking to extend gains. The yellow metal, a classic safe haven asset, is clearly benefiting from the recession concerns and the resulting risk aversion.

Bitcoin, however, has been largely trapped in a $8,200–$8,500 range since Tuesday. In fact, the top cryptocurrency’s bounce from recent lows near $7,700 has run out of steam near the 200-day moving average (MA) resistance at $8,483 over the last 48 hours.

The lack of demand for bitcoin as a safe haven asset amid the economic worries appears to contradict the argument often put forward by many observers that the cryptocurrency is digital gold.

Many investors also consider BTC as a store of value and a hedge against the aggressive expansionary monetary policies adopted by the major central banks. The odds of Federal Reserve delivering 2019’s third interest rate cut in October have gone up from 40 to 64 percent over the last two days, according to CME’s FedWatch tool.

Even so, BTC is struggling to find bids. In fact, the cryptocurrency fell from $10,000 to $8,000 in September despite the European Central Bank’s decision to cut rates by 10 basis points to -0.50 percent.

These factors suggest BTC is yet to take over the role of a classic safe haven and remains a largely uncorrelated asset.

The situation may change in the future, though, if traditional investor participation in the cryptocurrency market increases. After all, BTC seems to have all the properties of haven assets. For instance, it is not linked to government currencies and is deflationary in nature, which gives it an innate value, like rare metals, as noted by Reuters.

As for the next 24 hours, the probability of BTC falling below $8,000 is high, as per the technical charts.

Daily and 4-hour charts

On Tuesday, bitcoin created a doji candle – a sign of indecision – at the 200-day moving average, aborting the corrective bounce from recent lows near $7,700.

A convincing move above the 200-day MA, currently at $8,483, would invite stronger buying pressure, as discussed earlier this week.

A break above the key average looks unlikely, however, as the 4-hour chart (above right) is reporting a failed double bottom breakout – Tuesday’s move above the trendline was short-lived. The failed breakout indicates the sentiment is still quite bearish and validates the price-negative readings on the longer duration indicators.

The 4-hour chart relative strength index has fallen back below 50, indicating bearish conditions. As a result, a fall back to levels below $8,000 looks likely.

If the 200-day MA is breached, a quick move to$8,900 could be seen, as the daily chart MACD histogram is producing higher lows – a sign of weakening bearish momentum.

Overall, the outlook will remain bearish as long as prices are trading below $9,097.

The effects of banking restrictions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reached an Indian police department. The police sold some cryptocurrencies they seized only to find out that they cannot access the Rs 8.42 crore (~$1.2 million) proceeds due to the current RBI banking ban.

Police Funds Locked

Restrictions on banks placed by the RBI have caused trouble for police wanting to cash out seized cryptocurrencies. Last week, the central bank also blocked customers of Mumbai-based Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank) Ltd., with 137 branches across India, from accessing their savings.

Now the Pune city police department is unable to access Rs 8.42 crore which was converted into INR from the cryptocurrencies it seized last year from Akash Kantilal Sancheti, an accused in the Gainbitcoin Ponzi scheme, the Times of India reported Wednesday. The number of coins sold was 244.0925, which included an unspecified amount of BTC.

The police hired Discidium Internet Labs Private Ltd., which operates Indian crypto exchange Koinex, to sell the seized coins. The news outlet detailed that the proceeds are now sitting frozen in the company’s bank account at a branch of the Central Bank of India, a government-owned bank which is one of the oldest and largest commercial banks in the country.

District government pleader Ujjwala Pawar explained that “The police’s plea is pending before the sessions court.” The RBI has replied to the court notice, claiming that it had neither frozen the Discidium Internet Labs’ account nor directed the commercial bank to do so. According to the news outlet, Discidium Internet Labs has filed an interlocutory application before the country’s supreme court to direct the RBI to instruct the Central Bank of India to unfreeze its account.

Banks Close Crypto Exchanges’ Accounts

The RBI issued a circular, dated April 6 last year, prohibiting all banks and payment system providers from dealing in cryptocurrencies. Prohibited services include “maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of VCs [virtual currencies],” the RBI specified.

The ban went into effect three months later, and banks subsequently closed the accounts of crypto exchanges, forcing some of them to shut down, including Koinex. The exchange announced in June the permanent closing of its crypto trading services, citing that their “bank accounts with user funds are still frozen and the capital is held up.”

Koinex CEO Rahul Raj revealed: “We have consistently been facing denials in payment services from payment gateways, bank account closures and blocking of transactions for trading of digital assets.” He continued: “Even for non-crypto transactions like payment of salary, rent and purchase of equipment, our team members, service providers and vendors have had to answer questions from their respective banks — just because of an association with a digital assets exchange operator.”

Several writ petitions have been filed with the country’s supreme court to challenge the RBI ban. The case is ongoing, and the court was expected to resume hearing the case last week. Meanwhile, the Indian government is deliberating on a bill to ban cryptocurrencies. The case in the supreme court relating to the country’s crypto policies has been postponed to January next year since the government told the court that the crypto bill may be introduced in the next parliament session.

Or maybe, just maybe, that day is already here.

The evolution of Bitcoin and blockchain technology over the past few years alone has been vast (and impressive). From wallets and exchanges to payment systems, casinos, and even crypto-loans – a plethora of blockchain-powered services have sprung up to serve consumers and market participants.

London Summit 2019 Launches the Latest Era in FX and Fintech – Join Now

According to market and consumer data provider Statista, the number of blockchain wallet users grew from 10 million in 2016 to over 40 million in June this year – that’s a growth rate of over 400%.

The center of gravity in the blockchain universe has been Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or even a single administrator. The cryptocurrency can be sent from user to user on a peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

It’s not surprising that Bitcoin’s ascent has attracted wrath from banks, the traditional intermediaries of the financial and capital markets.

However, Bitcoin has been frowned upon by banks for many other reasons.

As Bitcoin’s popularity continues to grow at an impressive rate, so does the risk it poses to the traditional banking system. In 2017, JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon labeled Bitcoin as a “fraud” and even went as far as threatening JPMorgan staff with the sack if they traded it themselves. His contempt for the virtual currency didn’t stop there with the banker also calling it “stupid” and “far too dangerous.”

As vindication of Dimon’s comments, both JP Morgan and another top-tier US bank, Bank of America, both listed cryptocurrencies among the risk factors that could impact competitiveness and reduce revenues and profits, just two years later.

JPMorgan Chase isn’t the only bank to have qualms with Bitcoin. Other banks such as RBC Royal Bank, Regions Financial Corporation, Santander, PNC Bank, TD Bank, Citi, Bank of America, and even Capital One have also been reported blocking Coinbase purchases.

Coinbase is possibly the most renowned cryptocurrency wallet/exchange to date with an astounding 30 million users. To put this into context, RBC Royal Bank of Canada has approximately 16 million clients and has been operating in Canada for over 150 years – a country with a population of just 37 million.

Not only does Coinbase wield a continually growing user base, but it is also expanding with payment systems like PayPal while making progress towards obtaining its own banking license. The firm’s partnership with PayPal has started the process of cutting banks out of the equation, and this trend of bank redundancy is only likely to accelerate given the trajectory so far.

The monopoly

The prime reason why banks are worried about blockchain technology is the fact that innovative fintech products threaten the monopoly banks currently operate on a global level. Moreover, blockchains are fuelling industry-wide change, while banks are absolutely terrified of changing given their largesse and cumbersome operations.

The banking system has always seemed very simple and traditional. We trust banks to store our money and facilitate spending. Their ‘bread and butter’ is paying interest on deposits and charging fees for lending to borrowers. This simple banking model has underpinned modern society for hundreds of years.

Until recently, there has been a dearth of alternative money or payment processing providers. Other companies or individuals have struggled to break up the banking monopoly because its roots run deep, and its influence is all-encompassing. The companies applying for a banking license will know exactly how difficult it is to obtain a seat at the table.

Suggested articles Why Crypto Payments Can Change the WorldGo to article >>

However, cryptocurrencies have opened a new world of banking which is allowing end-users (you and me) to store our own money securely. Fintech innovations such as peer-to-peer networks, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and Bitcoin have leveled the playing field and empowered almost anyone to become a bank.

I can now rely on my fingerprint, retinal scan, or even more complex security measures such as cold storage wallets to store my own money. I don’t have to pay monthly fees, and my money isn’t benefitting someone else, it’s just mine.

This area is where banks are simply not needed, and I’m certain they are starting to notice.

Let the battle commence

Even though cryptocurrencies are on a resolute march forward while chipping away at the banking monopoly, let’s not be so naïve as to think that banks are not taking action.

Despite the fact there are a growing number of reports of banks blocking cryptocurrency purchases, many of these exact same banks are simultaneously investing in both cryptocurrency and blockchain start-ups. Maybe Dimon’s words are merely a bid to distract people and to prevent a stampede into cryptocurrencies?

In May 2019, Coindesk reported that JPMorgan is continuing to develop its own “JPM Coin,” using a private version of the Ethereum blockchain called Quorum. Quorum is also set to be the first distributed ledger platform available through the Microsoft Azure Blockchain Service.

Santander (another bank allegedly blocking Coinbase purchases) recently invested in Coinbase-backed token issuance protocol Securitize.

In parallel, RBC Royal Bank – a bank that makes it very clear they do not allow their credit cards to be used for cryptocurrency transactions – has been working on a blockchain-based payment system with JPMorgan and is a self-admitted supporter of Ripple.

Bank of America is busy chasing a patent for its own cryptocurrency wallet.

These are only a few of the examples of how banks are scrambling to get involved in an industry that is rapidly advancing without them. The fact that blockchains are built on open-source principles has meant anyone and everyone can now create their own blockchain projects, wallets, or even exchanges.

Technological advancements have left plenty of room for innovation and creative thinkers to create the next best thing.

To the over-enthused and the uninformed alike, it’s an easy bandwagon to jump on – to hate the banks because they control our money. To hate the government because they don’t understand the role of taxes. But the reality is that banks aren’t the enemy and we’re likely to need them.

As more companies like Coinbase emerge, we find ourselves facing less and less of a reason to use a bank. But this merely represents competition and not a revolution. The actions and investments being taken by banks are a clear sign that they now realize that Bitcoin is a vibrant competitor and not just a funky internet trend.

Blockchain-based businesses are on the rise, and it will not be long before companies are providing fiat-backed debit/credit cards to allow consumers to do our daily grocery shopping with our own cryptocurrency wallets.

Clearly, banks aren’t heckling fintech companies while sitting on the sidelines. They are well and truly in the game, and they’re in it to win it.

So maybe, just maybe, in tomorrow’s world, we will all become our very own bank.",2019-10-03 08:41:35+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3442680/facebooks-libra-crypto-backers-step-back-amid-regulatory-pressure.html,"Multi-national regulatory pushback against Facebook's effort to create a cryptocurrency payment network is slowing the project and causing supporters such as Visa and Mastercard to back away, according to sources familiar with the situation and a published report.

Along with the initial announcement of its Libra digital currency and Calibra online digital wallet to store it, Facebook earlier this year released the names of 27 founding companies who signed on to become part of the non-profit Libra Association. The association was formed to help construct and manage the blockchain-based payment network.

[ More info: Download: Beginner's guide to blockchain special report ]

Libra Association members such as Visa, Mastercard and others are reconsidering their involvement as pressure from U.S. and European regulators builds according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

One person directly familiar with the situation said Facebook's Libra team is ""overwhelmed now coping with regulator pushback"" and it is slowing innovation and implementation; earlier remarks by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg may have alluded to the same situation.

Libra is currently scheduled to go live in 2020.

""I think between Zuckerberg's statements and that the staff there are consumed with regulatory pushback, it's not clear to me what direction they'll take moving forward,"" said Avivah Litan, a vice president of research with Gartner. ""I think Libra could be delayed or trimmed down. I'd hope they can move forward in nations where there is no regulatory pushback.""

Members of the Libra Association have been asked to attend a meeting in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, according to The Washington Post. Those same Libra representatives are scheduled to meet in Geneva to review a charter for the Libra Association and appoint a board of directors, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Last month, French and German regulators became the latest to voice concern over Libra, saying it could threaten the Euro's value and unlawfully privatize money. U.S. regulators have offered up their own concerns about cryptocurrencies and the ability to mask transactions behind the anonymity of encryption.

""Governments can't control what goes on on blockchain. That's why they're so threatened by it,"" Litan said. ""Libra will jumpstart blockchain and cryptocurrency, but if it doesn't happen, there are still other cryptocurrencies out there. The technology is maturing. You can't control it.""

That doesn't mean governments aren't trying to control it.

Russia, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are attempting to regulate cryptocurrencies or roll out state-approved digital currencies based on blockchain. China has made it clear it wants a national cryptocurrency to compete with the world's de facto business currency - the U.S. dollar.

China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Merchants Bank, today announced its partnership with layered blockchain network Nervos to co-develop and launch decentralized applications for financial services.

Last year, CMBI made a strategic investment in Nervos' first round of financing, which totaled $28 million and included participation from other institutional investors like Sequoia China and Polychain Capital. CMBI plans to participate in Nervos' upcoming public token sale, which is expected to take place on Oct. 16 via CoinList.

Litan said she doesn't understand government concern about Libra over anonymity tied to possible money laundering, since Calibra digital wallet accounts would be directly tied to Facebook users; if the government wanted, it could subpoena those records.

""There is valid concern about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin because they can't always be traced to the owner, but Libra is not anonymous. You've got a Facebook account. You're anything but anonymous,"" Litan said.

Libra and other cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currency, such as JP Morgan's JPMCoin, also have the potential to serve a vast population of those in developing nations who don't have access to banking services.

Globally, 1.7 billion adults or 30% of the world's population remain unbanked, yet two-thirds of them own a mobile phone that could help them access financial services, according to a 2018 report from The World Bank.

The World Bank

The highest global economic growth rates in the next 50 years will come from Africa, where mobile money is already driving higher financial inclusion rates in Sub-Saharan region, according to the World Bank.

Coffee farmers, for example, don't have access to the world's marketplaces, and often have only one purchaser who may or may not pay the market's going rate.

GrainChain, a blockchain-based supply chain is currently piloting its distributed network and cryptocurrency to enable roughly 10% of Hondruas's coffee growers (about 12,000 farmers) to trade and be paid online.

""When coffee farmers don't have access to formal financial systems and formal contracts for purchase, they are the ones pushed down in the industry,"" said Luis Macias, CEO of blockchain-based supply chain service GrainChain. ""One of the larger focuses in the overall industry...is to find solutions to not only have more financial inclusion but enhance the ability for coffee producers to have a marketplace.""

Litan believes Facebook has invested too much time and money developing its Libra network to drop it and will likely roll it out in nations where it's not seeing regulatory pushback; that could also open it up even to users in the U.S. and Europe.

""People can jump onboard in any country they live in by circumventing IP-address matching. You can log-on through TOR. You can disguise where you're coming from these days,"" Litan said. ""Faceook will probably have a phased rollout in countries where they're not seeing this pushback.""",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/venezuelan-exchange-rolls-out-crypto-debit-card-with-petro-support,"Two Venezuelan companies have partnered to release a cryptocurrency debit card and point-of-sale (PoS) system.

“Crypto transfer device” supports four currencies

According to a social media release by state-sanctioned exchange CriptoLAGO on Oct. 1, the joint offering with so-called “investment cryptobank” Glufco is already taking orders. A translated part of the announcement states:

“What we were waiting for, our alliance with Glufco, puts us at the forefront.”

The system will provide support for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH) and Petro, the Venezuelan government’s state-backed digital currency.

Neither offering, it appears, will feature support for fiat currency, including the country’s troubled Sovereign Bolivar (VES).

Glufco refers to its product as a “cryptocurrency transfer device” — and hints that, in future, further cryptocurrencies could receive support automatically.

After leaving YouTube at the height of her channel in 2015, one of YouTube’s earliest creators and most famous beauty stars, Michelle Phan, picked up cryptocurrencies as one of her most stimulating interests, finding her discovery of Bitcoin more exciting than that of YouTube.

Feeling burnt-out, but also thinking that she'd accomplished all that she wanted to on YouTube since she started her beauty channel in 2007, the 32-year-old American makeup artist, entrepreneur, author, and voice actress decided that the highest point of the channel was the best to walk away, she told The Cut.

While Phan still has an interest in beauty and plans to pursue it, she has also turned to other things she finds appealing, one of which is cryptocurrency. She said in the recent interview that she needs spontaneity not to become bored, and crypto and blockchain seems to be the place for her. “I’m actually more excited about Bitcoin than I was when I first discovered YouTube,” Phan says.

As to what drew her to the Cryptoverse, she says: “I am a lover of decentralization. […] YouTube is decentralized, in the sense that anyone can have a channel, have their own network, and make their own content.” She further draws comparisons, explaining that Bitcoin is “not run by any higher authority power. It’s not a company. There are no board members. For the first time in history, you can be your own bank. We’ve never had that before.”

That is why she has been buying BTC in the past few years, believing that all entrepreneurs should make this “probably the most important investment you can ever make in your life.” Phan believes buying products and services with crypto is only going to get easier, saying that the situation now with cryptocurrencies is what it was with the Internet back in its infancy days. “Remember when there was only internet cafes? And now we have the internet on our phones.”

10 years ago, I was ridiculed for quitting my job to pursue my YouTube channel. No one saw the potential in the platform like I did.



Years later, I was ridiculed again for investing in BTC and ETH.



I like having the last laugh 🙂 — ℳ (@MichellePhan) August 19, 2018

Additionally, Phan invested in a cryptocurrency gaming company Quarters, and also discussed BTC on podcasts, including the one in September with the U.S. 2020 presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, as a guest.

At pixel time (12:23 AM UTC), bitcoin trades at c. USD 8,86. It's almost unchanged in the past 24 hours and down by 2% in the past seven days.",,https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/10/03/betting-on-bitcoin-prices-may-soon-be-deemed-illegal-gambling,"O N SEPTEMBER 24TH the price of a single bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, fell by $1,000 in 30 minutes. No one knows why, and few people cared. There have been similar drops nearly every month since May. Yet for one obscure corner of the market, it mattered. Exchanges that sell “long” bitcoin derivatives contracts, with which traders bet that prices will rise without buying any coin, soon asked punters for more collateral. That triggered a stampede. By the end of the day $643m-worth of bitcoin contracts had been liquidated on Bit MEX , a platform on which such contracts trade. Bets on other cryptocurrencies also became toxic.

Crypto-derivative products, which include options, futures and more exotic beasts, are popular. More than 23bn have been traded so far in 2019, according to Chainalysis, a research firm. But tantrums such as last month’s have put them in regulators’ cross-hairs. Japan is considering stringent registration requirements. Hong Kong bars retail investors from accessing crypto funds; Europe has had stiff restrictions since last year. Now the Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA ), a British watchdog, is proposing a blanket ban on selling crypto-derivatives to retail investors. A consultation ended on October 3rd. Its decision is expected in early 2020.

It would take an earthquake for the FCA not to press ahead. In the real world, importers buy derivatives as a defence against slumps in their domestic currency. But crypto-monies are not legally recognised currencies. They do not reliably store value, rarely serve as a unit of account and are not widely accepted. Peddlers of crypto-derivatives, the FCA says, cannot claim their wares are needed for hedging purposes.

That explains why most such derivatives are marketed as investment products. Yet they are not tempting places to park savings. The assets they track are hard to value: virtual monies promise no future cash flows. Prices across cryptocurrencies are strongly correlated, suggesting that demand does not stem from usage or technological advances. Instead it responds to hype (for which Google searches are a proxy; see chart). Thin trading means that prices differ widely between crypto-exchanges, making them a poor reference for derivative contracts. Illiquidity also amplifies swings: bitcoin is four times more volatile than risky physical commodities.

The FCA thinks crypto amateurs fail to understand all this. It estimates that investors in Britain made total losses of £371m ($492m) on crypto-derivatives from mid-2017 to the end of 2018 (net profit was £25.5m, but was mostly captured by the largest investors). Two other features can make losses catastrophic: leverage (platforms typically allow derivative traders to borrow between two and 100 times what they put in) and high trading costs. The FCA thinks its mooted ban could reduce consumer losses by up to £234m a year.

Insiders disagree. “This is a knee-jerk reaction,” says Jacqui Hatfield of Orrick, a law firm. “Crypto-derivatives are just as risky as other derivatives.” A ban could mean consumers invest directly in unregulated cryptocurrencies instead. Exchanges could relocate. In any case, says Danny Masters of CoinShares, which sells crypto vehicles, the regulator should not be choosing which technology thrives or fails.",2019-10-03

The billionaire said he would ""rather have bananas than bitcoin,"" in a YouTube question-and-answer session with Wired posted Sept. 27.

""I could eat bananas — bitcoin, not so much,"" Cuban said.

In response to being asked why he ""hates crypto,"" Cuban compared bitcoin to baseball cards, comic books and artwork, none of which have ""intrinsic value,"" he said. And there is less you can do with bitcoin than a baseball card.

""Crypto is so complicated for 99% of the population,"" he said. ""Do you put it in a device? Do you print it out? How do you keep it from being hacked? Who is going to host it for you?""

Cuban said he wasn't against crypto, but he thinks that people should be careful with it. To explain, he also compared it to gold: ""Gold is a religion. People who are really into gold, they'll tell you that there's a bad depression and things go to hell in a handbasket, if you own gold then you'll be okay — no, you won't!""

Cuban has warned about the pitfalls of crypto before. In July, he criticized Facebook's recent venture into cryptocurrency in an interview with CNBC.

""I'm not a big fan of what they're doing there,"" Cuban said of Facebook's Libra coin. ""I think it's a big mistake.""

He explained the impact it could have on global markets, where there isn't regulation or government stability.

""I think globally and in countries where there isn't a lot of rule of law, or a lot of government stability, or currency stability, then it could be dangerous,"" he said.

Despite his remarks, Cuban has invested in multiple businesses built on cryptocurrency and blockchain in the past, including a digital token e-sports betting platform and a venture capital fund for crypto. In October of 2017, he told Bloomberg that he has personally bought bitcoin.

""If you're a true adventurer and you really want to throw the Hail Mary, you might take 10% [of your savings] and put it in bitcoin or ethereum,"" Cuban told Vanity Fair. ""But, if you do that, you've got to pretend you've already lost your money.""

Don't miss:",2019-10-04,https://coinrivet.com/why-france-could-see-a-bitcoin-boom-in-2020/,"The news that 25,000 retail outlets are ready to accept Bitcoin in France is bringing fresh hope to crypto communities worldwide.

It’s the sort of milestone that could change the approach that everyday people and lawmakers have towards digital coins.

French daily newspaper Le Figaro published a detailed article about the EasyWallet application and its collaboration with 30 brands in France. The project would make Bitcoin payments possible in thousands of locations across the country, giving it a high chance of boosting cryptocurrency adoption.

The new payment system is the result of a partnership between EasyWallet, Global POS, and crypto payment provider East2PlayPayment.

Top French brands ready to embrace cryptocurrency

The decision to accept Bitcoin payments looks to be more meaningful than just grabbing exposure for their brands. Most companies mentioned in the press release by Global POS are established and popular already.

Among the top brands that will accept Bitcoin in France are many international names including Sephora, Foot Locker, Decathlon, Maison du Monde, Intersport, Norauto, Conforama, Cultura, and Boulanger.

For some of these companies, this isn’t their first attempt at increasing awareness of Bitcoin in France. In 2018, cosmetic and beauty store Sephora worked together with Lolli to provide crypto incentives for clients who were shopping on its online store. Clients could then use the rewards to buy gift cards.

How the payment system will work

The creators of the project haven’t released all the technical data on how the payments will be processed just yet. However, from what we’ve seen so far elsewhere, nothing will really change for the retailers involved in the project.

Buyers will use Bitcoin to pay for their products, but the sellers will continue to receive euros. The system will automatically convert the funds as part of the transaction. This step helps to counter price fluctuations, as Bitcoin is still a highly volatile asset and often suffers significant price peaks and troughs.

French cryptocurrency exchanges Deskoin and Savitar will manage the conversions. Both platforms are currently working to obtain their Digital Asset Service Provider accreditations in France.

Bitcoin in France: 2020 boom?

So will there be a Bitcoin boom in France next year? It’s still hard to say, although conditions are certainly becoming more favourable for its adoption.

This year started well for French citizens interested in cryptocurrencies. In January, local tobacco shops reportedly started selling Bitcoin right next to cigarettes and lottery tickets.

Back in April, France held its first-ever blockchain week in Paris and adopted the PACTE law, the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation. The law is a set of measures intended to facilitate access to diversified funding for small and medium businesses.

Essentially, France created a more relaxed legal framework for ICOs, public listing, investment capital, and crowdfunding. In its current form, the Action Plan simplifies procedures for digital-asset providers that operate in the French territory.

Regulators still haven’t come up with cryptocurrency-specific legislation, and they continue to warn about the risks that come with speculation. However, more importantly, they don’t seem to be against mass adoption either.

While politicians have announced they would block Libra in France, they seem more likely to accept Bitcoin. And with so many brands ready to accept Bitcoin payments, the country could see a boom in 2020.

100,000 merchants accept Bitcoin worldwide

The number of organisations accepting Bitcoin payments is now close to 100,000 worldwide. That’s only four times more than the entire number that France will have next year. If the French model works, we could see more countries adopting the same strategy.

Until now, paying with Bitcoin has had significant advantages, such as reduced fees, near-instant transactions, and a lack of intermediaries. We still don’t know what benefits the French system will add or remove from the table.

The main thing that remains to be seen is whether enough people are actually ready to spend their Bitcoins on lipsticks, footwear, and furniture. It may be a doable scenario for those who get paid in cryptocurrencies – but is it equally advantageous for people who get their wages in fiat?

The Bitcoin pizza bought for 10,000 BTC nine years ago continues to be a valuable lesson for cryptocurrency owners. People who see Bitcoin as a long-term investment opportunity are less likely to spend it just because they can.",2019-10-04 08:00:36+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/7-crypto-etps-now-trading-on-main-swiss-stock-exchange/,"7 Crypto Exchange-Traded Products Now Live on Swiss Bourse

Switzerland’s principal stock exchange now has seven cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs) listed. They allow investors to either gain exposure to individual cryptocurrencies or invest in portfolios of top cryptocurrencies. Four ETPs track the prices of single cryptocurrencies.

Crypto Index in Swiss Franc

MV Index Solutions (MVIS) and Swiss fintech firm Amun AG announced Thursday the launch of their newest crypto ETP, in association with Bitcoin Suisse. The Amun Bitcoin Suisse ETP (ticker: ABBA) has started trading on SIX Swiss Exchange, the main stock exchange in Switzerland for traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

The new crypto ETP is designed to track the prices of both BTC and ETH. MVIS Managing Director Thomas Kettner commented:

It’s our first index in CHF and especially designed to serve the Swiss market which has been demanding such an index.

“The Amun Bitcoin Suisse BTC/ETH ETP was designed for the Swiss by the Swiss,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan remarked. “It represents a unique way for investors to add the two major cryptocurrencies globally to their portfolio via a regulated product listed on SIX exchange and backed by a Swiss-based custodian.”

As of Oct. 4, the ETP’s underlying index comprises 88.68% BTC and 11.33% ETH. “Index weightings are reviewed on a monthly basis, based on the current market capitalization of each coin. The index is market capitalization-weighted, no cap or floor is being applied,” the Zug-based company clarified. As news.Bitcoin.com previously explained, ETPs listed on SIX Swiss Exchange are not ETFs.

MVIS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Eck Associates Corporation. Van Eck recently withdrew its application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to trade a bitcoin ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Instead, the company is now offering its bitcoin product to institutional investors under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, which is exempt from the SEC’s registration requirements.

6 Other ETPs Listed on SIX Swiss Exchange

Other than the newly listed ETP, there are six other crypto ETPs trading in USD on SIX Swiss Exchange. Four of them seek to track individual prices of single cryptocurrencies: BCH, BTC, ETH, and XRP.

The Amun Bitcoin ETF (ticker: ABTC) started trading on Feb. 26; it seeks to track the price of BTC only. The next to launch was the Amun Ethereum ETP (ticker: AETH), which started trading on March 5. The Amun Ripple ETP (ticker: AXRP) started trading on April 2, followed by the Amun Bitcoin Cash ETP (ticker: ABCH) on July 4.

The other two ETPs track the performances of baskets of cryptocurrencies. The Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP (ticker: HODL), the first crypto ETP listed on SIX Swiss Exchange, started trading on Nov. 21 last year. This product seeks to “track the investment results of an index composed of top five cryptocurrencies ranked by market capitalization,” Amun described. As of September, the portfolio comprises 50.27% BTC, 21.29% XRP, 19.10% ETH, 4.89% BCH, and 4.45% LTC.

The other basket crypto product by Amun AG is called the Bitwise Select 10 Large Cap Crypto ETP (ticker: KEYS). It “seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of up to the top 10 cryptocurrencies ranked by inflation-adjusted market capitalization,” Amun detailed. The underlying index is the Bitwise Select 10 Large Cap Crypto Index. As of Oct. 3, BTC accounts for 77.84% of this index, followed by ETH (9.10%), XRP (5.70%), BCH (2.11%), LTC (2.11%), EOS (1.46%), XLM (0.60%), XMR (0.52%), ADA (0.47%), and DASH (0.42%).

Crypto investment firm Grayscale has just released “An Introduction to Bitcoin Cash” highlighting the basics of BCH for those who may be yet unfamiliar, or just wish to brush up on the popular token forked from Bitcoin Core on August 1, 2017. With a significant reputation in the industry, Grayscale’s release of the document marks yet another important milestone in BCH recognition and adoption worldwide.

Grayscale Talks Bitcoin Cash

Grayscale Investments is a well-known firm in the crypto space, creating and managing billions in cryptocurrency investment trusts. A subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group, Grayscale announced in August that it would utilize Coinbase Custody’s services for storing underlying digital assets. Grayscale offers investment trusts in BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, ZEN, LTC, XLM, XRP, and ZEC, as well as a diversified option.

The newly released document, “An Introduction to Bitcoin Cash,” is a 14-page overview of the bitcoin cash token covering topics such as history, defining characteristics, differences between BCH and BTC, and advantages and potential disadvantages to BTC. The intro to the report notes:

Bitcoin Cash is one of the most successful hard forks of Bitcoin. Like its predecessor, Bitcoin Cash is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) digital currency and payment network supported by an open-source blockchain protocol.

Citing the implementation of Segwit and the Lightning Network, the report notes that “Bitcoin’s solution to the scalability issue was met with some resistance due to the removal of digital signatures as previously described in the Bitcoin whitepaper, leading to the simultaneous creation of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.”

Advantages and Potential Disadvantages

The main advantage of Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Core, according to Grayscale, is that on-chain scalability ultimately lowers transaction fees and encourages adoption. The report states:

As of September 30, 2019, the average fee for a Bitcoin Cash transaction was $0.002 USD, compared to Bitcoin, which was $1.07 USD. Furthermore, the 32 MB block size limit for Bitcoin Cash allows for approximately 106 on-chain transactions per second versus seven for Bitcoin.

The potential disadvantages of BCH when compared to BTC are identified as level of decentralization, low adoption and regulatory uncertainty. As for the regulatory uncertainty aspect, the report seems slightly misleading. Grayscale states that “To date, the SEC has only identified two digital assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, for which it does not intend to take the position that they are securities,” noting that Bitcoin Cash runs the risk of being viewed as such by SEC guidelines.

However, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, no such solid statement of intent actually stands. In a June, 2018 speech Hinman clarified:

“I would like to emphasize that the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. Even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security. If a promoter were to place Bitcoin in a fund or trust and sell interests, it would create a new security.”

Decentralization debates continue concerning both the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash networks, with large mining takeovers being one of the top concerns. Another point of potential trouble cited by the report is Bitcoin Cash’s large block size, which some presuppose may “introduce the possibility that less node operators have the resources to run BCH software, thereby potentially increasing the risk of further centralization.”

Advocates for Bitcoin Cash respond conversely that the “don’t spend, just hodl” mindset and high transaction fees promoted by BTC maximalist camps have a more detrimental effect, repelling would-be adopters (less nodes), and centralizing network power away from everyday users of Satoshi’s “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash.”

Summary

The Grayscale report closes with praise for the BCH network:

Over the last two years, Bitcoin Cash has shown continued resilience in the face of adversity, making it difficult for investors to ignore, and proving that it can coexist alongside Bitcoin.

To many in the space, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, but flippant discussions in this vein usually risk unnecessary contention and squabbling. As always, the free market is the final proving grounds for any asset, and where the original Bitcoin white paper is concerned, what the market needs according to Satoshi Nakamoto is a peer-to-peer, permissionless electronic cash.

MasterMana continues to spread

According to the research report published by cyberintelligence company Prevailion on Oct. 2, the MasterMana botnet uses budget Russian malware that is delivered as a Trojan via a phishing email scam.

The malware itself likely costs just $100, though the hackers also required a virtual public server at a cost of $60.

Despite costing just around $160 in total, MasterMana achieved considerable success, Prevailion warned, concluding that the bad actors behind it reached 2,000 devices each week since December 2018. The researchers noted:

“This campaign’s threat actors saw an opportunity and appear to have carved out a nice niche for themselves. We suspect that this particular threat actor is likely to continue operations, as previous public reporting has not deterred them, therefore we wanted to highlight their new modus operandi, so that network defenders may more easily identify their operations.”

Threats abound for crypto users

The malware works by arriving as an infected document in a phishing email. If a user opens the document, it would trigger a series of events which would create backdoors to steal any cryptocurrency holdings in associated hot wallets.

The resurgence in the price of cryptocurrencies this year has led to new threats being detected on an almost weekly basis.

Just last week, cybersecurity experts warned about a new spyware which used encrypted messenger Telegram to replace user wallet addresses with its own.

Recently, major Slovakia-based antivirus software provider ESET has discovered a banking trojan that can steal cryptocurrencies and is especially widespread in Latin America.

As Cointelegraph reported, estimates put the total amount raised by cybercriminals this year at $4.3 billion.",,https://www.investors.com/news/facebook-stock-paypal-quits-facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-group/,"PayPal (PYPL) announced it is withdrawing from the consortium of companies supporting Facebook's (FB) Libra cryptocurrency as other big-name backers like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are getting cold feet. Facebook stock rose.

Facebook Libra was already suffering from weakening support in its consortium amid fierce blowback from regulators, sources told the Wall Street Journal earlier this week.

PayPal said Friday that while it is quitting the Libra Association it remains ""supportive of Libra's aspirations,"" and that the firm will continue to work with Facebook in the future.

""PayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations,"" the firm said in a statement.

Losing the backing of an industry giant like PayPal is a big blow to the Facebook project. Especially as the project is being led by David Marcus, a Facebook executive who previously served as PayPal's president.

PayPal did leave some wiggle room in their statement that leaves the door open to them rejoining the project at a later date.

The firm said the social media giant ""has been a longstanding and valued strategic partner to PayPal,"" and that it will ""continue to partner with and support Facebook in various capacities.""

Bitcoin Price, Bitcoin Stocks

Bitcoin turned lower, trading down 0.1% at $81.59. according to CoinDesk. The largest cryptocurrency has been struggling of late. However it has been regaining some ground after slipping below the $8,000 mark for the first time since June at the end of September.

Among other digital currencies, Ethereum was up 1.8%, Bitcoin Cash rose 2.5% and Ripple (also known as XRP) was flat.

Among Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) closed up 2.4%. Overstock.com (OSTK) lost 1.3% and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) edged up 0.4%.

Lawmakers Skeptical Of Facebook Libra

Lawmakers have been strongly skeptical of the Facebook cryptocurrency project. In July Congress held cryptocurrency hearings focusing on Facebook Libra, with members of both parties criticizing the digital currency idea. That follows skeptical comments from President Donald Trump and Fed chief Jerome Powell.

And on Thursday, the Federal Reserve's vice-chair for supervision, Randal Quarles, gave skeptical commentary on crypto at the European Banking Federation's summit in Belgium.

""Although there is a small risk to financial stability today there is no doubt the potential scale of stablecoins and other cryptoassets yet to emerge may pose regulatory challenges,"" he said.

The social media giant has been trying to reassure Congress that Facebook Libra will not launch until U.S. policymakers' concerns are resolved.

On Sep.24, David Marcus, head of the Calibra digital wallet division head, told Congress that Facebook is committed to working with regulators and getting permission before launching.

""We want to get this right,"" Marcus said in a letter to Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. ""We will not launch until we have addressed all U.S. regulatory concerns.""

Facebook Stock Up

Facebook shares closed up 0.6% at 180.45 on the stock market today. However Facebook stock has fallen below sell zone after a breakout from a a cup-with-handle base on July 9 failed. The buy point was 198.58, according to MarketSmith analysis.

It is currently trading below its its 50-day line in recent sessions, though it has found support after falling to 200-day moving average. Facebook stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 69.

PayPal stock rose 1.7%. It has fallen below both its 50 and 200-day lines, which is a bearish indicator. However its Composite Rating of 88 is superior. Mastercard stock gained 2.2% and Visa stock added 1.8%.

Looking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps",2019-10-04 21:35:15-07:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-rating-council-is-out-to-help-change-us-regulatory-landscape,"At the end of September, a number of established crypto firms (including Kraken, Bittrex and Coinbase) that are currently operating in the United States came together to establish a new governance body called the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) so as to jointly provide more clarity on the definition of various cryptocurrencies — that is, establish which digital assets can be classified as securities and those that can not.

This development comes as an effort to provide investors (as well as casual enthusiasts) with a clear outlook on which tokens they can trade freely without supervision by various regulatory authorities. Some of the other big-name entities that have signed up to become members of the CRC include:

Circle Internet Financial.

Genesis Global Trading.

Grayscale Investments.

Anchor Labs.

DRW Holdings’ Cumberland unit.

In addition to this, a Wall Street Journal report also mentions that the CRC is in the process of recruiting new firms to its steadily growing roster. This is being done in order to expand the CRC’s market presence as well as provide the independent crypto body with an air of mainstream legitimacy.

From a technical standpoint, the recently formed council will publish online ratings for digital assets, scoring them on a scale of one to five, where the higher number indicates that a particular asset can be considered a security and thus cannot be issued, sold or traded by unregulated firms.

On the subject of whether the CRC will prove to be a positive development for the industry at large, Cointelegraph reached out to Carlos J. Molina, former vice president at Merrill Lynch & Co., executive director of Morgan Stanley’s Private Wealth Management Group and the current chairman of Private Investment Bank Limited. He told Cointelegraph that, as someone who keeps a close eye on the industry, he is a great supporter of the council:

“The membership’s goal is an important one, in terms of trying to bring legitimacy and regulation for continued expansion, scale and reliability. I admire the effort put forth by all companies who have joined in this initiative. However — as I’m looking at it from a banking and investment perspective. [...] I believe they need a wider involvement from others in the securities industry and experts who have experience complying with all regulations and standards, globally.”

Molina further added that it was one thing to have top practitioners taking part in the council’s various initiatives and activities, but to have full-scale experience and perspective to ensure compliance with international securities issuance standards requires a whole new level of industry involvement. He pointed out:

“The end-goal must be investor protection. This focus would really increase the credibility of the CRC and make a significant impact on end-to-end compliance regulations with the SEC, and other recognized regulatory institutions.”

While Molina’s views regarding the CRC seem to be quite warm and optimistic, Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, is of the opinion that even though the basic premise of the CRC is well-intentioned and understandable, it may end up doing the industry more harm than good.

Maeszalek told Cointelegraph that in its attempt to bring clarity to this space, the CRC’s opaque rating rules could cloud already-murky waters and add to the confusion that has plagued the crypto market for nearly a decade now. He then went on to say:

“Regulators have had ample opportunity to be supportive of the industry’s efforts to self-regulate over the years, but didn’t take it. I don’t think regulators in the U.S. will perceive the CRC as a viable means to self-regulation; instead they will view it as a misguided attempt that lacks legitimacy and leaving the industry again in need of regulatory clarity.”

Will regulators recognize the CRC?

A pertinent question that has been floating around on the internet since the launch of the CRC is whether or not regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will now alter their own classifications of crypto assets.

Responses on the topic have been quite varied. To get additional clarity on the subject, Cointelegraph reached out to Dan Novaes, CEO and co-founder of Current Media, which claims to have raised $36 million via its CRNC token sale last year.

Novaes believes that, despite the launch of the CRC, it is highly unlikely that the SEC will suddenly change its stance on the crypto industry overnight, adding:

“Independent of the CRC and other lobbying groups, the fact of the matter is that the SEC’s job is to protect investors and consumers alike. Do I believe new rules and exemptions will come into place overtime? Yes, I do. Do I believe crypto companies will not be subject to reporting requirements, the legal hurdles required for registered offerings and investor accreditation checks? Absolutely not. However, the CRC is a step in the right direction.”

On the subject of whether the CRC possesses the required power to bring about any actionable changes within this domain, Sean Keefe, managing partner at crypto investment fund Straight Up Capital, similarly believes that it is still too early to tell what the outcome will be in terms of the CRC achieving its goals.

He further pointed out that there are a number of skeptics who argue that this centralization of control is counterintuitive to the core tenets of cryptocurrencies. Keefe highlighted:

“The key will be how effective CRC will be in maintaining a decentralized governance, that is aligned with the users and developers of crypto. The goal of blockchain and crypto and is to create access, limit centralization, and promote transparency, if the CRC achieves those outcomes it will be a positive outcome.”

How does the crypto industry view the CRC?

To assess the impact of the CRC on the crypto market, Cointelegraph reached out to Sukhi Jutla, an IBM blockchain developer and author of three books. In her opinion, the CRC clarifying the industry will only help to solve existing regulatory issues:

“The SEC should welcome the creation of the CRC as it shows key players in the industry making an effort to create more clarity in this industry. With more clarity, it will make more people more comfortable in using cryptocurrencies which will undoubtedly help local crypto markets to thrive and flourish. People need to feel more confident before they jump into this area and not feel worried they could be penalised.”

A similar point of view is shared by Pauline Shangett, chief communications officer of cryptocurrency exchange ChangeNOW. Shangett believes that the CRC is a promising initiative that is going to do a lot of good for all kinds of blockchain businesses in the U.S., both young and old.

She added that owing to the council’s use of a unified evaluation framework, crypto firms of all financial statures will be treated equally by the council. Furthermore, as Shangett told Cointelegraph, she believes the system introduced by CRC is resourceful:

“It includes some really important metrics that can be applied to an asset that is looking not to be a security, and Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin serving as really neat examples of already existing evaluations, the system will be pretty hard to argue with. All of us in the crypto community are looking for the same things — crypto being recognized and adopted worldwide. [...] If CRC actually delivers on its job of making it easier for the SEC to make their decisions, it’s amazing.”

Soon after the CRC was formed, the council unveiled its first batch of 20 ratings. XRP, Maker (MKR) and Polymath (POLY) have all scored four or above, classifying them as securities in the eyes of the CMC.

On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Monero (XMR) and Dai (DAO) were not considered securities, as they each achieved a score of one on the scale. Litecoin creator Chalie Lee has welcomed the score given to LTC in a tweet:

“Although it’s been clear to most that Litecoin is not a security, it’s still good to see the Crypto Rating Council agree.”

Will the CRC will succeed in its mission?

While the market is currently abuzz with all of the recent developments surrounding the CRC, only time will tell whether this independent governance body will be able to make any real impact on this fledgling market sector. For now, most experts agree that the initiative should be commended and viewed as a step in the right direction because it factors in the needs of both regulators and investors.",,https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/Bitcoin-ATMs-coming-to-San-Antonio-What-does-14492137.php,"Bitcoin ATMs coming to San Antonio. What does that mean...

Inside of an unassuming convenience store along Callaghan Road sits an ATM that’s likely different than any you’ve used before.

The machine allows users to buy and sell Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency widely known for its volatile value — as well as the ardent support it enjoys from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and the intense skepticism many business leaders and academics have toward the digital currency.

San Antonio currently has about 31 cryptocurrency ATMs — largely located in gas stations and convenience stores — that are owned by several different operators. They allow users to create an account, then buy and sell Bitcoin for a fee, typically between 5 and 20 percent, according to Coin ATM Radar, a site that tracks installation of the ATMs globally.

Coinsource, one of the largest cryptocurrency ATM operators in the nation, announced recently it was “ramping up deployment” of the machines in San Antonio and across Texas.

The increase of the ATMs, Bitcoin advocates say, will greatly enhance the accessibility of the digital currency to the public as the machines are adopted, and will move Bitcoin from its original home on the fringes of the internet into the commercial and monetary mainstream.

Bitcoin is the most widely-used cryptocurrency. Proponents tout the decentralized nature of the digital currency, and its use outside of the traditional banking and financial system.

No central bank or single nation owns or operates the cryptocurrency system. The goal for supporters of the currency is to allow anyone in the world to make peer-to-peer monetary transactions at any time without having to go through financial or governmental intermediaries.

Bitcoin, which was created in 2009 but remained difficult to acquire until recent years, has fluctuated wildly in value since becoming more popular earlier this decade.

After peaking in value at around $20,000 per Bitcoin in late 2017, the digital currency tumbled to below $3,200 per coin by mid-December of last year.

On a recent day, Oct. 2, Bitcoin’s value hit $8,414 per coin, only to drop by around 3 percent hours later, according to coinmarketcap.com, which tracks cryptocurrency prices.

The number of cryptocurrency ATMs in the U.S. has dramatically increased over the last five years, especially within the last year, according to Coin ATM Radar.

The first Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. were installed in March 2014. By Oct. 1, 2016, there were 429 of the ATMs nationwide. Since then, the number has grown to over 3,800 cryptocurrency ATMs across the country.

In the last year, nearly 1,500 additional cryptocurrency ATMs have been installed nationwide.

“We are spearheading mainstream adoptability and accessibility to be able to buy and sell cryptocurrency,” said Derek Muhney, director of national sales with Coinsource, the cryptocurrency ATM manufacturer and operator.

“We definitely see (the number of cryptocurrency ATMs) going to six figures and beyond,” he said.

But while local cryptocurrency investors laud the introduction of additional crypto ATMs in San Antonio, others are skeptical the currency and the ATM proliferation.

“Easy access to cryptocurrency through ATMs is actually detrimental,” said Ashwin Malshe, a professor of marketing at University of Texas at San Antonio, and an expert in e-commerce and cryptocurrency.

“When you hold U.S. dollars in your bank, you don’t wake up the next morning and see your bank account is worth 50 percent of what it was yesterday. That can happen with cryptocurrency — that can be somebody’s life savings wiped out overnight,” Malshe said.

But crypto-optimists and proponents of the ATMs say they provide benefits such as offering communities without banks or credit unions access to financial tools, including storing and sending money.

One example might be a person without a checking or savings account purchasing Bitcoin on an ATM and sending the money elsewhere, or simply saving it to lower the risk of carrying a large amount of cash, according to Muhney.

Muhney said the ATMs provide a way for users to buy or sell Bitcoin instantaneously. Users can also exchange the digital currency for cash on the spot.

Traditional online Bitcoin exchanges — chiefly Coinbase — allow people to trade Bitcoins, but users can wait for weeks to receive their money or Bitcoins.

And the history of fraud, theft and illicit trade associated with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often makes people hesitant to hand over their bank information to cryptocurrency exchange companies, Muhney said.

But with ATMs from Coinsource and most other operators, users typically create an online digital wallet and aren’t required to share banking information, Muhney said.

And while the price does fluctuate, he said, it wouldn’t necessarily be hazardous to store your money on a Bitcoin ATM because the value of the currency continues to grow in the long run.

“Even at its current price today, it’s still up 200 percent from the beginning of the year,” Muhney said. “Yes, there is fluctuation, but year by year, its going in the right direction.”

Crypto-advocates are quick to point out that the digital currencies have been declared dead during price downturns throughout the decade, only to rebound and continue rising in value.

Alex Eaton is a co-founder of the San Antonio Crypto Network, where he consults with potential cryptocurrency investors and educates people about the digital currency.

He said his experience in the Army, when he was deployed to the Middle East as a medic, showed him what can happen when nations and their economic systems collapse.

“I just don’t think anything is too big to fail,” Eaton said.

Eaton supports the addition of more Bitcoin ATMs because it allows people to easily access the cryptocurrency, and the proliferation of the ATMs could make for a seamless global system, he said.

“With Bitcoin ATMs in every city across globe, you can travel with Bitcoin, download a Bitcoin wallet onto your phone and travel anywhere in the world,” Eaton said. “As long as you know how to securely store your bitcoin, no one can take it.”

Even so, Eaton is supportive of regulating cryptocurrencies to help reduce fraud. He admits even he’s been scammed.

“It’s so easy to scam people in this space because most people in this space are very amateur — they don’t know much about it,” he said.

Crypto scams can include hacks into your virtual wallet, with thieves stealing your Bitcoin, or fraudulent exchanges that may swipe money you try to send through them. Some scammers have even created fake companies to persuade people to invest Bitcoin before disappearing with the money.

Both Eaton and Malshe said that in the early days of cryptocurrency, it was largely used to anonymously make illicit transactions, primarily of drugs on sites such as the now-defunct Silk Road.

Malshe dismissed the vigor with which crypto-advocates promote the digital currency as enthusiasm borne from self-interest.

“If I’m sitting on 15 Bitcoins, which I bought for pennies, now I have very strong incentive to hype that up and then I can make money. I’m going to always be very aggressive and strong promoting it to anyone who will listen,” Malshe said. “It’s a classic pump-and-dump strategy. This is the salesperson attitude.”

Malshe said he doesn’t think it’s likely Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies reach a point where they are used for retail or daily transactions en masse.

“I don’t see that. The governments are going to lose control of their own currency, which is super difficult to believe any country is willing to do that,” he said, noting that China last year has already banned all activity related to cryptocurrency trading. “The monetary policy of the country is very important.”

Muhney, of Coinsource, said when credit cards were first introduced as payments options midway through last century, businesses were likely skeptical about the idea of allowing payment via the new method. Eventually, of course, credit cards became nearly-universally adopted.

“That’s where we’re going with this. We make it as easy as it can be to be able to buy and sell this and as easy as it can be for business owners to accept it,” Muhney said. “All they’re doing is allowing themselves to receive an additional stream of revenue.”

But Malshe said you shouldn’t expect to use Bitcoin to make regular purchases any time soon — and he didn’t recommend investing in the digital currency or using the incoming ATM machines.

“If it’s a very knowledgeable person who knows what they’re getting into, I can understand (using cryptocurrency ATMs). But they don’t need an ATM. I overall don’t see this as a positive development,” Malshe said. “I don’t see a world where crypto is going to become easy to use everywhere.”

Crypto Crisis: PayPal Leaves Libra Association : Libra, the crypto project founded by Facebook, has just suffered a heavy blow according to a number of sources. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Friday afternoon, a spokesperson for the fintech giant, PayPal, said that the company has decided to “forgo further participation” in the project. Despite this, they added that PayPal continues to support Libra’s mission to democratize finance, and will thus keep its options open with Facebook in the future. This announcement comes shortly after sources to the Financial Times said that PayPal representatives did not make an appearance at a Libra-focused event in Washington.

Featured Image from Shutterstock",2019-10-05 18:00:15+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/whats-next-for-the-industry-as-crypto-winter-thaws,"It’s hard to tell who was the first to coin — if you’ll forgive the pun — the name for the dramatic price drop of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins as the “crypto winter.” But the name accurately captures the simultaneous collapse of around 2,000 global cryptocurrencies that lost a total of 80% of their aggregate market cap.

The term “crypto winter” probably came into more widespread use after BTC’s price drifted south to around $3,000 per Bitcoin in December of 2018, it’s lowest price in more than a year.

For the crypto industry, 2018 was a year of changes due to price corrections — also referred to as the Bitcoin crash and the Great Crypto Crash. The crash caused widespread investor panic and proclamations from the mainstream media that the cryptocurrency “bubble” has ended. Meanwhile, long-time members of the crypto community were not bothered.

“I’ve been involved in this space since Bitcoin was less than $1 each, so I don’t pay any attention to the short term fluctuations,” Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, told Cointelegraph. “The price is the least interesting aspect for me.”

But even if we look beyond price, the crypto winter has had a lasting impact on the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. So, how exactly did this so-called “crypto winter” affect the industry?

The depths of winter: The negative impact

A review of past media coverage can help us understand the negative impact of the crypto winter for the industry. The discourse surrounding crypto in 2018 was polluted with a number of scams, Ponzi schemes and all manner of illegal actions that resulted in millions of dollars stolen or missing in dead funding.

One of the most prominent crypto skeptics, Nobel Prize winning economist Nouriel Roubini, claimed in February 2018 that Bitcoin, “the mother of all bubbles,” had started to crash. John Reed Stark, the former head of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement, warned about an upcoming period ripe “for fraud, manipulation, insider trading, hacking, and a broad range of chicanery.”

The Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young released a study showing that cybercriminals had stolen approximately $1.5 million per month in initial coin offering (ICO) proceeds, totalling around $400 million of the funds raised.

Being surrounded by such bad actors and the uncertainty that their behavior created, the genuine projects struggled to have their value seen and heard. As a result, in the words of blockchain startup founder Grace Wong, “many of these legitimate projects retreated completely from blockchain and crypto, waiting for all that noise to settle down.”

Unsurprisingly, the Forbes 2019 “Fintech 50,” a list of the world’s top financial technology firms, included only six blockchain companies. That's almost half as many as in 2018, when there were 11.

A similar picture can be seen with the job market: Comparative statistics from analysts at job-searching platform Indeed, which shared its findings with Cointelegraph, showed that blockchain and cryptocurrency-related job searches have declined by 52% over the last year (June 2018–June 2019).

From winter must come spring: The positive impact

On the flip side, it is obvious that both blockchain critics and advocates share the understanding that things can only get better from here, which makes the metaphor of “winter” particularly apt.



“The Crypto Winter in my view actually had quite a positive effect on the progress and development of our global blockchain ecosystem,” Daniel Diemers, PwC’s leader for blockchain in Europe and the Middle East, told Cointelegraph. “The flashy startups and ICO projects that were not well supported and managed disappeared in the cold virtual snow, while the better funded, high-quality projects made it through the Crypto Winter.”

Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange — commonly known as ICE and is the operator of the New York Stock Exchange — summed up this perspective of renewed, but cautious, optimism when he stated: “It’s really been helpful that the cryptocurrency industry sort of went into what they call a winter.”

Earlier this year, Emin Gün Sirer, the co-director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts (known as IC3) and an associate professor at Cornell University, similarly emphasized this idea, saying: “Overall there are some really good signs that the crypto winter washed out most of the scams.”

A quick look at the statistics speaks for itself: 2017, when cryptocurrencies’ prices hit record highs, was also a year of an extreme number of scam projects. As a study prepared by ICO advisory firm Statis Group revealed, an astounding 80% of ICOs conducted in 2017 were identified as scams. The study took into consideration the lifecycle of ICOs run in 2017, from the initial proposal of sale availability to the most mature phase of trading on a crypto exchange.

Way back in December 2017, Ernst & Young conducted research that warned that “ICOs have become a synonym for hype, unjustified valuations and excessive risk.”

Later, a new EY survey collected data on ICOs’ performance between January 2018 and September 2018, concluding that “a portfolio of these ICOs is down by 66% since the peak of the market at the beginning of this year.”

The data shows that the ICO market correlates directly with the Bitcoin price and that the crypto winter successfully washed the scammers out from the scene. As a result, the industry has become more complex, robust and structured than it was two years — or even one year ago.

“This was healthy for the ecosystem, as the primary focus shifted to the longer term, and quality projects and technology again became more important than bold marketing statements and airdrop campaigns,” Diemers of PwC said.

This could be a critical advantage in terms of promoting the next, more sustainable wave of growth of the ICO market. PwC’s third strategic report on ICOs states: “ICOs have gained further momentum and are emerging as a workable, alternative form of crowdfunding.”

Another point lies in the distinction between cryptocurrency and blockchain technology: The crypto winter will not affect the potential use of blockchain technology and the growth of businesses related to it.

One good example here can be seen in the number of patents related to blockchain tech and distributed ledger technology. Back in 2017, blockchain technology had been predicted by both Forbes and Deloitte to be one of the major technological trends for 2018.

And then in January 2018, Bloomberg revealed its ranking list of companies that filed blockchain-related patents, placing Bank of America, IBM and Mastercard on the first, second, and third places respectively. The article noted:

“Blockchain technology could reshape the global financial system as banks look to use it to speed trading, improve record-keeping and simplify back-end functions.”

Another positive impact is related to the regulatory environment. A lot of countries around the world have made several steps toward blockchain and crypto regulation these past two years. For example, the world’s economic powerhouse, the United States, has not exercised its federal power to regulate blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, although several states within the country have enforced their own legislation — including Arizona, Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware and Wyoming.

Related: Europe Takes Serious Steps Toward Blockchain Adoption

The Intercontinental Exchange also took advantage of the crypto winter to purchase crypto assets at a discount for its institutional cryptocurrency trading platform, Bakkt.

Some experts also believe that 2019 is the year when institutional investors will consolidate around crypto, such as as Rohit Kulkarni, head of research for SharesPost, who said that “the ongoing ‘Crypto Winter’ is a healthy cleansing of the ecosystem because the correction is effectively separating long-term value creators from short-term day traders.”

The crypto winter’s positive impact could also be seen in the corporate world. As was pointed out in Deloitte’s Global Blockchain Survey 2019, organizations have changed their opinions toward blockchain technology, focusing on “what business models it might disrupt.” We can most clearly see the positive impact of the winter in the comparison of attitudes in 2018 and 2019 toward blockchain.

One more good sign for the crypto industry was highlighted in a Cambridge Associates research, which states:

“Though liquid crypto prices have fallen sharply of late, investment activity in the space is booming. Investors interested in the industry need to spend a considerable amount of time learning about the space, getting comfortable with its very high risks, performing manager due diligence, and carefully implementing allocations.”

Is the crypto winter over?

While the crypto winter’s positive and negative impact could be debated among experts, meanwhile, there is a consensus that it’s already over.

Although Bitcoin is still some ways behind its record highs — which peaked in December 2017, when the leading cryptocurrency’s price hit record highs around $20,000 per coin — experts believe that the market’s struggles in 2018 are unlikely to be repeated any time soon, and analysts have declared the end of the winter.

Overall, the cryptocurrency and blockchain tech sectors seem to have been cleaned of scammers and Ponzi schemes, allowing real projects to benefit from the emerging technologies. And Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, was among the experts to have confirmed that the crypto winter is over.

After the hype surrounding blockchain technology passes, its real global adoption will take place. It is undoubtedly hard to predict the future, but the majority of researchers see the future for blockchain as bright and growing. A Deloitte survey states that more than half (53%) of organizations see blockchain tech among their critical, top-five strategic priorities. PwC research noted:

“Blockchain will generate an annual business value of more than US $3 trillion by 2030. It’s possible to imagine that 10% to 20% of global economic infrastructure will be running on blockchain-based systems by that same year.”

Similar forecasts for blockchain technology can be found in more corporate research, including this from IBM and WinterGreen Research: ”The digital ledger market for blockchain products and services is anticipated to reach $60.7 billion in 2024, up from $708 million in 2017.”

The crypto winter was a painful process for the industry. But one that many experts think was necessary and are ultimately relieved happened.

“Crypto Winter culls the herd and tempers the steel,” Shapeshift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees told Cointelegraph. “All but the most tenacious hopes and dreams are crushed, abandoned in the frozen wastes as they lay gasping toward the moon that never came.” He concluded:",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-insurance-a-promising-sector-despite-caution-of-major-players,"The growth in popularity of cryptocurrencies has, in many ways, outpaced the infrastructure built to support it. In terms of security, cryptocurrency exchanges that serve both as a marketplace and a store of the digital assets have become a hacker’s favorite target. Now that the cryptocurrency market has grown to its current capitalization of more than $200 billion, demand for crypto insurance is gaining traction.

Already, big-time insurers are emerging as major players in the market: Lloyd’s of London, a centuries-old insurer with a net worth of $45 billion, partnered with Coinbase last year to provide a $255 million policy in April this year.

Apart from Coinbase, other cryptocurrency custodians that have purchased insurance include Gemini, Kingdom Trust and Anchorage.

Why is there a need for crypto insurance?

Despite the remarkable technology backing cryptocurrencies, recent reports show that cybersecurity is still one of the biggest threats to the industry. Security research firm CipherTrace estimates that more than $4 billion worth of crypto funds was lost through theft and fraud in 2019.

For example, Binance, one of the biggest crypto platforms, announced in 2019 that it had “discovered a large-scale security breach” that resulted in hackers stealing 7000 Bitcoins worth a whopping $40 million.

According to Binance, the hackers used phishing and viruses to access the company’s hot wallets that allegedly contained about 2% of the company’s BTC holdings. Fortunately, Binance created a Security Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) in 2018 to protect users and their funds in such cases. Since 2018, the SAFU has been receiving 10% of all Binance’s trading fees as funds that are set aside in cold storage to be used in extreme cases.

Another case which highlights the need for crypto insurance is the Bitfinex hack of 2016. In June 2019, two Israeli brothers were arrested in connection to the cyber attack that saw the firm lose nearly 120,000 BTC (worth around $72 million at the time).

Since the start of this year, at least seven crypto exchanges have reported a large-scale hacking attack on their platforms. One of these is Bittrue — a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange that lost about $5 million in XRP and Cardano.

These reports highlight just how prevalent cyber attacks have become in the crypto space. What’s more disturbing is that cybersecurity experts reveal that “such attacks can be carried out with far more rudimentary levels of self-taught skills.”

While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hartej Sawhney, the co-founder of cybersecurity agency Zokyo Labs, said that, “there’s an array of low hanging fruits for hackers,” adding, “you don’t need military training to conduct cybercrime on today’s centralized exchanges.”

The challenge of insuring cryptocurrencies

With millions at stake, not to mention a growing cryptocurrency market capitalization, the insurance industry can provide a safety net for crypto investors. Traditional insurers can restore investor confidence in cryptocurrencies as a store of value.

Giant crypto exchanges like Binance, Gemini and Coinbase have already put in place insurance covers to compensate users in case of an incident. For instance, Coinbase claims in an insurance document that it maintains “commercial criminal insurance in an aggregate amount that is greater than the value of digital currency” it holds in hot storage.

The document further reads that Coinbase’s “insurance policy is made available through a combination of third-party insurance underwriters and Coinbase, who is a co-insurer under the policy.”

In October 2018, Gemini also obtained insurance services from Aon and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The company’s head of risk said:

“Consumers are looking for the same levels of insured protection they’re used to being afforded by traditional financial institutions.”

However, regulatory uncertainty is one of the biggest challenges that insurers are facing at the moment. All over the world, regulators are concerned about money laundering risks presented by cryptocurrencies, yet few have set out clear policies and frameworks on how cryptocurrencies should be traded and used.

Related: What Crypto Exchanges Do to Comply With KYC, AML and CFT Regulations

While speaking to Cointelegraph, Yusuf Hussain, Gemini’s head of risk, also agrees that, “The biggest concerns from traditional insurers are rooted in the lack of regulatory clarity.” He adds:

“Thoughtful regulation in cryptocurrency will be the lynchpin for increased availability of crypto insurance. Done right, it can pave the way to healthy and sustainable markets and fuel long-term innovation that unlocks the promise of cryptocurrency and transforms society for the better.”

In his opinion, the best way to provide crypto insurance is to include appropriate licensing while “building an institutional grade infrastructure that meets the standards established by traditional financial markets.” Hussain says:

“An independent evaluation of the design and implementation of an exchanges security controls is also important [since] obtaining a SOC 2 report helps the industry move from saying it’s secure, to demonstrating it’s secure.”

The volatility of cryptocurrency prices also contributes to insufficient insurance coverage in the industry. In January of last year, data from coinmarketcap showed that the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry was valued at over $800 billion, while currently it is fluctuating at just over the $200 billion mark. Volatility affects the valuation of insurance premiums, thus limiting the number of coins that can be insured in case of a hack.

A lack of insurance statistics in the cryptocurrency industry also presents problems of coverage pricing, as historical data is normally used to calculate premiums. In a volatile industry characterized by three-figure price swings, insurers can only manage to cover a small number of lost coins.

Coinbase, for instance, only insures a $255 million limit of its hot storage coins with Lloyd’s of London. It is unknown whether there is insurance for the rest of its cold storage coins.

What insurers stand to benefit

There is still a big education gap and a lot of misunderstandings preventing traditional insurance companies from providing full covers for the cryptocurrency industry. Add that to the challenges highlighted above, and suddenly it’s understandable why exchanges are having a hard time getting worthwhile insurance for their customers.

Despite the overall hesitant approach, insurance companies like Lloyd’s of London have always paid attention to Bitcoin. In a 2015 report, Lloyd’s assessed the risk factors of crypto insurance, mentioning that “the establishment of recognized security standards for cold and hot storage would greatly assist risk management and provision of insurance.”

Apart from Lloyd’s, a report by Bloomberg noted that other major players in the insurance industry such as Aon, Allianz and Marsh & McLennan are also paying attention to cryptocurrency insurance.

Cointelegraph talked to Timothy Fletcher, the lead of Aon’s western region Financial Services Group (FSG), who believes that:

“Certain insurers are willing to deploy capital and create bespoke insurance solutions for digital asset companies, many remain conservative given the evolving nature of the underlying blockchain technology.”

Fletcher added that, “a number of the larger, established insurers have taken a hard line and do not participate in the crypto sector at all.” In Fletcher’s opinion:

“A lack of regulatory clarity and limited insurance loss experience” are among the main issues causing the hesitant approach of the insurance market towards crypto.

On the other hand, the Bloomberg report showed that although the crypto industry is rife with heists and fraud, there are many insurers “betting they can avoid the pitfalls” to benefit from the substantial premiums of crypto insurance.

When asked to comment on possible methods that could be used to improve crypto insurance, Fletcher suggested that crypto exchanges should partner with a brokerage representative who is “knowledgeable about digital assets and understands how to navigate a volatile insurance market.” Fletcher also believes that insurers will need to understand the unique risks of each crypto exchange company while being mindful and respectful of the underwriting process.

For example, underwriters can charge up to five times or more for coverage against loss or theft. With a growing number of crypto startups considering insurance as a must-have in these times of cyber insecurity, there are greater opportunities for insurers to offer products tailored to each client’s specific needs. Furthermore, clients looking for wider coverage will need more underwriters in a practice that will reduce risk when disaster strikes.

Insurers are learning the space

Despite the many hurdles facing the cryptocurrency insurance space, the growth of the market over the years is hard to deny. All things considered, the insurance business is a people business and, therefore, the most effective way to improve engagement between crypto exchanges and insurers is to have in-person meetings. Such interactions will allow insurers to get a feel for a company’s management, culture and compliance.

Insurers can benefit from the increased demand for crypto insurance and boost their yields with bespoke products. Considering the growing trend in the number of insurers who are investing time to understand the risks and opportunities involved in the crypto space, it is time for insurers to consider offering coverage in this emerging industry.

Fledgling companies in the insurance world are already moving in to provide tailor-made products. Market experts like Fletcher foresee an influx of insurers into the space:

“Many insurers will offer coverage in this space; however, the coverage terms and conditions can vary greatly (e.g., coverage for hot vs. cold storage).”

While there is a need for more education around the subject of crypto insurance, another important factor to be considered is transparency. Traditional insurers are looking for full transparency to tackle some of the custody challenges of the crypto insurance market. Perhaps it’s time to rethink insurance policies and design them for individual cryptocurrency owners instead of custodians.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-is-2019s-best-performing-asset-even-after-recent-price-downturn,"The Takeaway

Bitcoin prices have more than doubled in 2019, far outpacing the 31 percent return for U.S. tech stocks, which Goldman Sachs deems the best-performing asset class year-to-date.

Outsize returns could attract interest from big investors in the yield-starved traditional financial markets.

Executives at data firm Messari say bitcoin prices, currently around $8,200, could rally to a new high in the year’s remaining months, topping the $12,902 level reached in June.

Investors would be hard-pressed to name a better-performing asset class so far in 2019 than bitcoin.

Gold? Up 17 percent since Dec. 31. Stocks? The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index returned 21 percent through Sept. 30. Bonds? The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond is yielding just 1.6 percent, close to historic lows.

And bitcoin? Prices for the cryptocurrency finished the third quarter around $8,308 each, according to data provider Messari, up 114 percent on the year. Investors who bought on the last day of 2018 would have doubled their money, and then some.

On Wall Street, one of the chief criticisms of bitcoin is that it was invented only a decade ago (a baby by old-world standards) by a computer programmer (or programmers, nobody really knows), with no real fundamental, underlying value. It’s just a made-up thing, as they say, with a volatile price that only derives from what the next buyer is willing to pay.

But with the global economy slowing and trillions of dollars of government bonds from Europe and Japan trading with negative yields, bitcoin’s price gains this year could conceivably attract a new wave of investors who previously wouldn’t even take a look.

Already there are signs they are. Pantera Capital, one of the earliest cryptocurrency funds, recently scheduled an event in San Francisco for its existing investors featuring cryptographer and digital currency pioneer Nick Szabo. As word trickled out, a number of investors who had never touched the asset class contacted the firm requesting invites, said Paul Brodsky, a partner at Pantera.

“There’s a lot of drama around it all, there’s a lot of energy, there’s a lot of press,” Brodsky said. “We’re getting interest from significant institutional investors of all types.”

Fear of missing out

The year’s price gains might entice big institutional investors like pension funds and endowments, struggling to hit return targets so they can meet obligations to retirees and other beneficiaries, according to executives at the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm KR1.

“Bitcoin’s been around long enough now where people are more familiar with it,” said Keld van Schreven, a director at the London-based firm, adding:

“Yep, it swings wildly, but they might know other people who have bitcoin, and say to themselves, ‘Hey, they’ve done pretty well this year.’ It’s always down to fear of missing out.”

In a report this week, analysts for the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs ranked information-technology stocks as the best-performing sector year-to-date with a 31 percent return, noting the out-performance versus other asset classes like bonds and gold.

Bitcoin wasn’t mentioned in the report, a reminder that the market remains in its infancy; big Wall Street firms aren’t yet trading digital assets in any significant scale. But year-to-date, bitcoin’s price gains are nearly four times the level of those hottest-of-hot tech stocks.

Many investors first noticed bitcoin in 2017 as prices famously rose more than 20-fold, reaching an all-time high of $20,089 in December of that year. After an abysmal 2018, bitcoin is now 59 percent off that peak, according to Messari, a New York-based provider of data on the crypto markets.

But at the current price, the digital currency is still up more than 10-fold from its level at the start of 2017’s rally.

Store of value

One of the long-term arguments for bitcoin is that, unlike stocks and bonds whose prices are often highly sensitive to the decisions of central banks and governments, the cryptocurrency is independent of sovereign authorities. Instead, it’s governed by fixed policies that are hard-coded into the underlying network, and therefore difficult to change.

Under those rules, the supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, so it won’t be prone to inflation like developed-market currencies such as the U.S. dollar, euro and yen might be if their respective central banks resorted to more money-printing as a way of stimulating their economies.

Indeed, President Donald Trump, running for reelection in 2020, has repeatedly called for steeper interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, while accusing China of artificially pushing down the value its currency, the yuan, to get an unfair advantage in international trade.

Many cryptocurrency proponents characterize bitcoin as Gold 2.0 – essentially a newer, technologically improved and more portable form of the precious metal, viewed since ancient times as a reliable store of value.

“Bitcoin is slowly becoming digital gold, but it’s not there yet,” said Qiao Wang, New York-based Messari’s head of product.

No safe haven

For now, though, even professionals in the space acknowledge that bitcoin is highly speculative; many traders are just betting on whether the next series of price ticks will be up or down.

“At the end of the day, bitcoin is still a very speculative asset,” says David Martin, chief investment officer at the cryptocurrency investment firm Blockforce Capital in San Diego. Because of the dramatic price swings in recent years, or even on a daily basis, he says, “it’s not a safe-haven asset.”

Martin noted that prices for bitcoin have declined in recent months, from a 2019 high of about $12,900 on June 26, partly because of waning enthusiasm in the industry over the near-term prospects of a wave of institutional money coming into the market.

Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, debuted a new bitcoin-futures contract last month that was tailored to meet the needs of institutional investors. Yet volume in the new contracts totaled just $5 million on the week.

Compare that with the $26.5 billion of corporate bonds that changed hands each day in the U.S. market during the third quarter, and it’s clear institutions have yet to meaningfully invest in bitcoin.

Vital signs

Some of bitcoin’s internal gauges, though, reveal a healthy and growing market.

For example, bitcoin’s so-called hash rate, a gauge of processing power, has increased this year to about 90 exahashes per second (an exahash is a quintillion hashes), from about 40 exahashes at the start of the year.

And some industry executives think bitcoin prices might be setting up for a rally. Catalysts could include an escalation of Trump’s trade war with China.

Wang says he took an informal poll among his coworkers, and the average forecast for the year-end 2019 price was $13,252.

“The number is totally within the realm of possibility,” he said.

There are risks, too, of course, such as the prospect of a regulatory clampdown. “Obviously it could go a lot lower,” Wang said.

Well, now the bank’s been robbed and you’ve turned to Decrypt, perhaps the only thing there is left to trust in this broken world.

Perhaps someone hacked into your exchange account and bled your account dry; perhaps you sent crypto to someone posing as someone else, perhaps the company you invested in turned out to be a scam, and made off with the cash?

You’re not the only one: According to a 2019 report on cryptocurrencies by security company Kaspersky, almost a fifth (19 percent) of survey respondents said they’d been hacked on exchanges, and a further 15 percent said they were victims of cryptocurrency fraud.

We’ve quizzed lawyers, security experts, and world-class academics for their advice on what to do when your crypto’s been stolen—and gathered the accounts of victims so you can learn from their experiences.

Act fast to trace your stolen cryptocurrency

“The quicker you can act, the better,” Benjamin Sauter, a partner at Kobre & Kim law and a veteran of crypto theft cases, told Decrypt. Wait too long, and you’ll give thieves more time to transfer assets to cold storage, to send funds to less favorable exchanges or to send them through tumblers to mix them up, all of which makes the funds harder to trace. “The more sophisticated you are, and the less sophisticated the thieves are at laundering the assets, the better chance you have,” said Sauter.

If the funds sit in an exchange, Sauter said you’d better get on the phone with the exchange quick, and ask them to kindly freeze the funds. With luck, the exchange will comply, buying you some precious time. Unfortunately, you might have to cough up some of your remaining cash to a lawyer, who can flash their teeth at the exchanges to freeze the funds, or convince a court to issue an order for them to be frozen. If you’re completely out of pocket, Sauter said that asking the exchange yourself is worth a try.

Identifying crypto thieves

To have the legal system recover your cryptocurrency, you first need to know who stole it. You’d potentially be able to freeze funds against John Doe or Persons Unknown, legal terms for a court case brought against someone you don’t know, but according to Marc Jones, a partner at Stewarts Law in the UK, ""In general, to enforce an order requiring fraudsters to pay damages or handover stolen property, ultimately you’ll need to know who they are.""

Luckily, as Jones reminds us, “One of the benefits of any blockchain currency is you can see where coins have gone.” If a coin’s gone through an exchange, then it’s easy to work out who the wallet holder belongs to. Exchanges have know your customer (KYC) checks, which require users to provide identification to the exchange in order to register. From there you can get a court to order the exchange to reveal the thief’s identity.

But hold on, what if the exchange holder is just some punk middleman? When funds enter an exchange, the money is dispersed throughout to provide liquidity, so it’s difficult to trace who owns what. And what about mixers, another common method for people to scramble the identity of coins, programs whereby funds are mixed together to obscure the identity of tokens?

First, don’t lose hope, because mixers aren’t necessarily effective; a 2015 paper by Korean computer scientists showed that the popular Helix mixer wasn’t as good as everyone thought it was. The scientists could identify the relationships between the input and output addresses of the Helix mixer with over 99 percent accuracy.

Second, there are companies -like Chainalysis, whose customers include the FBI and ICE - committed to finding and tracing stolen crypto funds. For a couple of thousand dollars a pop, these companies trace the flow of stolen crypto through public keys, and then use complex data analysis to work out who owns the wallets. For instance, if a fraudster gave some stolen bitcoin to their friend, and that friend posted their bitcoin wallet address online, it’s fairly obvious whodunnit.

Getting your stolen cryptocurrency back

Jones knows how to get his clients out of a bind. In a landmark UK court case, he represented Liam Robertson, who owns a huge crypto asset management firm and was defrauded of 100 Bitcoins earlier this year. Robertson had agreed to invest in a crypto project over the phone. It turned out that a hacker had tapped the line, and sent an email to Robertson asking for Bitcoin, spoofing the sender’s address to pretend he was the executive from the project that Robertson planned on investing in. But Robertson’s lawyers convinced the court to issue an asset preservation order on 80 of the Bitcoins which went to Coinbase, freezing the funds. Why care? Jones got the High Court to admit that Bitcoin was “property”.

That makes it much, much easier for victims of crypto theft to get stolen funds back. Under English common law—one of the oldest and most revered legal codes—while a victim of fraud can sue a fraudster for damages, victims have a better chance of recovery if they can find and freeze their property wherever the fraudster has hidden it. But whether cryptocurrencies are “property” is a contentious issue. As we speak, a British legal taskforce is devoted to sorting this very issue out.

In the US, Sauter said there’s no such problem regarding the legal status of Bitcoin as “property.” Once you figure out who the person is and get a judgment against them, you can go and force that judgment against anything. “You could go try to collect the Bitcoin that was stolen; you could take it to his house and call the sheriff to put a boot on his Lamborghini and give you the Lamborghini...it’s not a problem.”

Sauter helped Elizabeth White, CEO of cryptocurrency asset management firm and luxury goods marketplace The White Company, recover millions of dollars worth of Ripple from now-defunct crypto exchange Cointal—which Sauter thinks was run by “essentially fraudsters”. According to a press release put out by The White Company last year, it was the first suit to rule that the misappropriated funds had to be returned to the plaintiff.

The thief worked with a Cointal employee to manipulate a transaction on the exchange. White agreed to transfer a large amount of Bitcoin to Ripple’s XRP tokens, but the thief pocketed the funds. “They took her money and were like, ‘Sorry, we're not giving you your end of the transaction back’. And she was like, “What?”,” explained Sauter. White watched her money bounce around the world before it landed at Bittrex, an exchange that’s registered in the U.S. Then, Sauter’s lawyers served a subpoena to work out who owned the wallet, and got a judgment from the court. Because the judgment was against a person, they could use any means necessary to get the crypto back. And they did: White was awarded a total of $2.7 million, according to the press release. And “dozens of Cointal victims have come forward with similar experiences.”

It’s also worth checking if you have a right to sue the company responsible for the hacking. Jones tells Decrypt about an ongoing case against telecommunications giant AT&T, in which Bitcoin investor Michael Terpin had $23 million in Bitcoin stolen from him in a SIM card fraud. In response, he is suing AT&T for failing to protect him. “AT&T is therefore directly culpable for these attacks because it is well aware that its customers are subject to SIM swap fraud and that its security measures are ineffective,” reads the lawsuit.

No such luck for one victim, though. Kyle Asman, a founder of blockchain advisory firm BX3 Capital, was SIM-jacked, whereby a fraudster impersonated his identity to a mobile phone service provider. With your phone number, a fraudster has access to everything: that two-factor security system you secured your Coinbase wallet with? Useless. Asman said his crypto was stolen from a Coinbase wallet. “There is absolutely nothing they do to help you out—except freeze your account. Tracing wallets is next to impossible...I know a number of people who have been victims of SIM-jacking. Almost no one has been successful in recovering [stolen funds],” he told Decrypt.

So, swings and roundabouts.

How to protect yourself from crypto hacks

Now you know a little more about how to recover your stolen cryptocurrency, how to protect yourself from future attacks? Aleksey Malanov, Malware Expert, Anti-Malware Technologies Development at Kaspersky, has some ideas you might not have thought of.

Malanov suggested dividing your funds into ""cold"" and ""hot"" wallets. The “hot” wallet contains a small amount of the funds you need for everyday use, and access to it is automated. But Malanov advises that between 95-99 percent of your funds should be stored in a cold wallet that’s not connected to the internet and not automated—a hardware wallet such as a Ledger or Trezor, or a “paper wallet”. “In this case, unauthorized remote access to this wallet and, moreover, the compromise of private keys is excluded,” Malanov told Decrypt.

In conjunction with a cold wallet, Malanov suggested using a multi-signature wallet, like CarbonWallet or Xapo, where multiple people have to authorize a transaction for it to go through. In the same way that several people have to authorize a nuclear missile strike at the same time for the launch to occur, you can use an algorithm that would stop a single person from siphoning your funds. “The compromise of only one key also does not lead to loss of funds,” said Malanov.

And advice for crypto thieves? “Stop stealing crypto,” said the lawyer, Sauter. You heard it here first.",2019-10-05 11:26:09,https://www.coindesk.com/algo-capital-loses-crypto-funds-after-ctos-phone-is-hacked,"Algo Capital, an investment firm focused on the Algorand blockchain, lost a few million dollars in USDT and ALGO tokens after its chief technology officer’s phone was breached, CoinDesk has learned.

As a result of the breach, roughly $1 million to $2 million in the cryptocurrencies were taken, according to an email from CEO David Garcia seen by CoinDesk.

“Yes, there was a security breach,” Garcia told CoinDesk in an email. “We communicated to all the Algo Capital VC Fund Limited Partners and updated them about the incident.”

The network itself remains unscathed. The Algorand team is aware of the breach suffered by the investment firm, the source said.

Algo Capital has raised $200 million for its Algo VC Fund, with the cash intended to support projects in the Algorand economy. Algo Capital founder and managing partner Arul Murugan said in an August 2019 statement that:

“Our investment approach specifically targets companies that are creating the next great blockchain applications and infrastructure solutions, and as a result, helping to speed blockchain adoption and bring millions of new users into the Algorand network.”

The investment firm is a separate entity from the Algorand Foundation and Algorand LLC, which oversee the blockchain’s actual development. Pablo Yabo has resigned his position, according to the email sent to partners. Further security measures have been taken by the firm. The majority of the firm’s funds were held in cold wallets that were not compromised.

The firm is taking full responsibility for the loss and committed to reimbursing the full amount within 20 months. “We are engaging with certain key organizations and security services to collaborate and address this issue which has become a common industry problem,” Garcia wrote.

The Algorand blockchain itself was first envisioned by MIT professor Silvio Micali in 2017 as a possible solution to the scaling issues other blockchains face. Under its consensus mechanism, the network randomly selects the machines which add the next blocks to the blockchain, as a variant of the proof-of-stake mechanism.

UPDATE (Oct. 7, 01:40 UTC): Yabo pledged in a Medium post published Sunday to shoulder most of the reimbursement cost, writing:

“I take responsibility for this and thus will be personally covering most of the stolen funds and the rest will be covered by Algo Capital General Partners.”

Yabo also confirmed his departure from Algo Capital in the post. “I have decided to focus entirely on Randlabs.io to do what I love most: build tools and software that increases the adoption of blockchain technology,” he wrote.

Though Bitcoin might act as a macro hedge against global turmoil in some instances, it has largely performed negatively when the S&P 500 has dropped. It will be interesting to see how Bitcoin moves in the next few weeks.

Bakkt’s launch did not generate the interest it was expected to do, which led some to blame it as the reason for the recent drop in Bitcoin. However, institutional traders do not jump in without testing waters. In a press release, Intercontinental Exchange stated that Bakkt completed its first block trade, executed between Galaxy Digital and XBTO on Oct. 1. Following the trade, XBTO said the platform “can accommodate large trades.”

The dominance of Bitcoin continues to drop, which shows that the action is gradually shifting to altcoins. However, for the altcoins to continue their outperformance, Bitcoin has to either consolidate or move up gradually. In the event of a sharp drop in the leading cryptocurrency, a number of altcoins are likely to follow suit. Let’s analyze the charts of the top performers of the past seven days and try to spot any reliable buy setups.

LINK/USD

Chainlink (Link) is the top performer of the past seven days. It has risen about 25% during the period. This is the second consecutive week that the cryptocurrency has found a place among the top performers. Does it indicate a change in trend? Let’s analyze its chart.

After consolidating between $1.50 and $2.0531 for the past five weeks, the bulls are attempting a breakout above this range. If the LINK/USD pair sustains above $2.0531, it will indicate strength. The next level to watch on the upside will be a move to $2.8498, above which the momentum is likely to pick up. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the previous analysis.

However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $2.0531, the pair might extend its stay inside the range for a few more weeks. The pair will weaken on a break below $1.50. The next support to watch on the downside is $1.3139, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally.

TRX/USD

In order to find loopholes in their security systems, companies offer bug bounties to hackers to find bugs and submit a vulnerability report. The Tron Foundation is the third-largest spender on such bug bounties trailing EOS and Coinbase.

Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has frozen 12 billion TRX and has voted itself as the highest-ranked “Super Representative” in the Tron (TRX) ecosystem. While a few have viewed this as a positive, others have objected to this buyout by the industry leader. Can the currency build on its recent pullback? Let’s study its chart.

The TRX/USD pair declined close to the yearly low of $0.01124 the week before. This is a negative sign as it shows that bears continue to sell on minor rallies. If the current pullback fails to scale above the overhead resistance of $0.01774, we anticipate another attempt by the bears to sink the pair to new lows.

However, if the cryptocurrency rises above the overhead resistance, it might face some resistance at the 20-week EMA, which is sloping down. If this resistance is crossed, a move to the 50-week SMA and above it to $0.0409111 is possible. We will wait for the price to scale and sustain above $0.01774 before proposing a trade in it.

EOS/USD

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has settled charges against Block.one, the parent company behind EOS, with a penalty of $24 million, for conducting an unregistered initial coin offering. In a recent article, a security engineer has raised concerns that the EOS network can be congested using just a few dollar’s worth of EOS. However, Block.one has said that the network is operating “correctly.”

The EOS/USD pair is currently in a downtrend. The bears broke below the critical support of $3.1534 the week before, which shows continued selling pressure. However, the bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above $3.1534. If successful, a move to the downtrend line is possible.

This is a major resistance, above which, the pair can rally to $4.8719. The momentum is likely to pick up above this level. History suggests that the moving averages are unlikely to offer a stiff resistance. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the downtrend line and keep a stop loss below $2.40.

However, if the bulls fail to scale the price above $3.1534, the bears will try to resume the downtrend and retest the 52-week low at $1.55.

XRP/USD

Ripple has acquired crypto trading firm Algrim which will give it an entry into Iceland, where the company wants to establish an engineering hub. In another announcement, Ripple’s investment arm Xpring has partnered with cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay, enabling businesses to accept XRP payments via BitPay’s cross-border payments platform. Separately, content creators with web monetization platform Coil can now receive XRP funds in real-time, following a tie-up between Coin and GateHub Ltd. Can these string of partnerships and acquisitions boost prices? Let’s analyze the chart.

The XRP/USD pair has formed a descending triangle, which is a bearish setup. Though the price closed (UTC time) below the support at $0.24508, the bears have not been able to capitalize on the breakdown. This shows buying at lower levels.

Currently, the bulls have again pushed the price back above $0.24508. However, the recovery will face resistance at both moving averages and above it at the downtrend line of the triangle. The pair will turn positive if it breaks out of the triangle.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from one of the overhead resistances and plummets below $0.22, the downtrend will resume. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) CEO Charles Hoskinson has announced that American footwear brand New Balance will use the Cardano blockchain to authenticate a range of its products. Though it has found a place among the top five performers, has the cryptocurrency bottomed out? Can it build on its gains in the next few weeks? Let’s find out.

The ADA/USD pair plunged to the critical support of $0.035778 the week before. Though the bulls have managed to defend the support, they have not been able to achieve a strong rebound. This is a negative sign as it shows a lack of demand even at these levels.

A shallow pullback is likely to encourage bears to again attempt to break below the support of $0.035778. If successful, a drop to the 52-week low of $0.02830 is possible. If this support also gives way, the pair will start a new downtrend.

However, if the bulls manage to keep the price above $0.035778, a move to $0.0560221 is likely. We do not find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we remain neutral on the cryptocurrency.

Seven years ago, bitcoin was a foreign language to federal prosecutor Katie Haun. That changed when her boss at the U.S. attorney's office asked her to look into shutting it down. What's now the most widely used cryptocurrency was a niche payment method being used in the depths of the internet, in many cases being used to buy illegal goods on black markets. But Haun quickly decided the currency itself wasn't what needed probing. ""It would have been akin to saying 'let's go prosecute cash,'"" Haun said.

Instead, her department prosecuted multiple cases where bitcoin was being used for extortion and white collar crime. In some cases, the technology behind bitcoin, known as blockchain, actually helped the department solve cases. Haun's view on cryptocurrency has evolved, and so has her career path. After spending much of her professional life prosecuting prison gangs, corrupt officials, and the mafia, she's now the first female general partner at Silicon Valley investing powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz. Haun runs the $350 million cryptocurrency fund that launched last summer and was an early part of Facebook's libra launch, making her one of the most recognizable investors in the space.

Becoming a prosecutor

Haun spent her early years abroad thanks to her parents' jobs at a Fortune 500 company, and her teenage years in Cairo, Egypt. She moved back to the States to attend Boston University, then Stanford Law School, and began her career as a law clerk. Haun eventually worked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. When Kennedy asked where she wanted to be in ten years, Haun told him: ""I want to be a prosecutor."" She got her break in an eastern Virginia district right outside of D.C. known as the ""rocket docket"" for the high volume of cases, and how fast they move from investigation to trial. It's also well-known for its high-profile cases, covering the CIA, Pentagon and other federal agencies. She saw everything from international drug cartel to national security cases come across her desk. One of those first trials was a man smuggling firearms on airplanes in and out of D.C. at Reagan National. Haun was later sent on assignment to the Justice Department headquarters, working in a newly created group called the National Security Division, which was born out of post- 9/11 legislation. There, she monitored nationwide terrorism cases, including the Miami ""dirty bomber"" Jose Padilla trial. By 2009, she moved west. ""At that time, California was in the midst of a bunch of things. A number of gang wars were going on,"" she told CNBC at Andreessen Horowitz's Menlo Park, California office. Haun prosecuted Nuestra Familia, one of the biggest prison gangs, as well as the Hells Angels, and the ""Mongols"" motorcycle gang. The latter two were in a violent battle with each other that culminated in the president of the Hells Angels being shot dead in the streets of San Francisco. ""After the biker murder trial, I was looking to do something else — I was exhausted,"" she said. ""I changed my focus away from more of the violent criminal enterprises to some more of the kind of cyber security, white collar criminal organizations.""

'Digital bread crumbs'

It was around that time that the bitcoin task came to her desk. ""They said 'we have this perfect assignment for you' — there's this thing called bitcoin and we need to investigate it,"" she said. ""That was the first time I'd ever heard of bitcoin."" She started viewing it through the same lens as she saw cash: bitcoin could enable criminal activity but it wasn't responsible. In some ways, its technology actually helped her solve cases. Blockchain transactions are stored on a digital ledger that are visible to anyone but can't be changed. That ""digital bread crumb"" helped her track down illegal funds more easily than tracking cash. Haun said it was even easier than credit cards or international bank accounts, which can be tough to subpoena. ""The government was able to use that same technology to actually track down criminal activity it might not otherwise have been able to,"" she said. ""Without the technology underlying bitcoin, we never would have been able to catch those people.""

Her deepest dive into crypto came through a white collar crime and public corruption case where government agents were exploiting early adopters of cryptocurrency. One of the agents stole about 20,000 bitcoin — worth about $160 million at today's prices — while another extorted the creator of Silk Road, and stole from other early crypto investors. Had that crime been committed in cash, she said, it would have been nearly impossible to track these people down. She quickly became the in-house crypto expert and did see plenty of nefarious uses for cryptocurrency. But she said, a similar phenomenon had happened in the early days of the internet and cellphones. ""Sometimes, the earliest adopters of new technologies are criminal,"" she said. ""Criminals are always looking for loopholes, or new ways to exploit systems."" Through investigations related to the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox and famous internet black market, Silk Road, she got to know some of these early adopters. Legitimate players in the industry did not want their platforms to be for crime. But Haun said not all of them immediately warmed to the idea of trusting a government official. In 2015, she decided to form a task force to be a resource for other prosecutors and agents known as ""digital currency coordinator."" Haun began hosting regular meetings and training seminars with Treasury, IRS and other government agencies and other government officials working in the space. It was around that time she started teaching a class on cryptocurrency at her Alma mater, Stanford Law School, which is now taught at Stanford Graduate School of Business.

The 'credible face of crypto'

After more than a decade, Haun was ready to leave the federal government, and ""felt like she had accomplished what she wanted there."" Still, she wasn't necessarily looking to go into the crypto space full time and was considering a higher level political appointment. In the meantime, she joined the board of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase where she met Andreessen Horowitz partner Chris Dixon. It was Dixon, who she now runs the fund with, who floated the idea of talking to the firm's founder, Ben Horowitz. While Haun said she had never contemplated an investing career, some of her skills as a federal prosecutor made her perfect for the role, Horowitz told CNBC. Until then, the venture capitalist said he had never hired a prosecutor for anything: not even when he was CEO of Opsware, formerly Loudcloud, which was acquired by Hewlett-Packard for $1.6 billion in 2007. He immediately voted yes on Haun despite her lack of investing experience. What stood out was a ""glow in the dark presence,"" and a need to win, he said. She was also incredibly well networked with technical experts in the industry and to his knowledge, was the most well-known person in the field. Horowitz pointed to advice a mentor named Ken Coleman, a former executive at Silicon Graphics, gave him: the mistake people make ""constantly"" in Silicon Valley is they hire the resume instead of the skill set. They go in blindly, looking for someone from Greylock, Benchmark, Apple or Salesforce. ""If you're always fishing in the same pond as everybody else, you can't get that big a recruiting advantage,"" said Horowitz, who is also a former Netscape executive. ""We wanted somebody who could be the kind of poised credible face of crypto."" He called her former boss at DOJ for a reference, and as Horowitz put it, his answer was ""what are you stupid? This woman has never lost a case — she takes more cases than anybody, and she takes the hardest cases. There's nobody like Katie here."" A mentor told Haun that the perfect job fit is somewhere ""you know 50 percent of the job cold"" and have 50 percent left to learn. This fit the bill, and she took it. But Haun ended up having a deeper skill set than she expected, thanks to days spent in front of a jury. In the deal process, she knew how to learn about a company. Instead of finding out who was a double agent, she was now sitting across the table and deciding who they could partner with. ""Do we trust them? Are we going to be good partners for each other? They have these projections and these milestones — do we think that's realistic?"" These were all questions she was used to asking. Her other key skill set goes back to her days of describing complicated topics to a jury. Cryptocurrency is among the most inaccessible, opaque topics out there. ""When you're a prosecutor, you need to feel comfortable getting up in front of an audience of people who come from all walks of life and get them to understand a topic they might have never heard anything about,"" Haun said.

Libra

Cryptocurrency was launched into the spotlight this summer after Facebook unveiled its digital currency project, libra. Andreessen Horowitz joined as a founding member, along with names like Visa, Mastercard, and Spotify. The Wall Street Journal reported that the group behind the global currency payments network is becoming fractured with financial partners ""reconsidering"" involvement following a backlash from government officials, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. PayPal announced on Friday that it was pulling out of the project. There are still roughly two dozen members in the association, who are working on charter documents that are expected to be finalized this fall. Haun would not comment on the progress, but said her team has an ""active role"" in the project. For now, she said there are still important technical questions that are being worked out before it goes live. Libra immediately drew widespread scrutiny in the days following its announcement. Facebook's involvement caught the attention of senior congressional finance committee members, global regulators, former lawmakers and industry insiders who questioned Facebook's motives. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, told CNBC in June that ""it's very important for them to stop right now what they're doing so that we can get a handle on this"" and Congress would ""move aggressively"" to deal with it.",2019-10-06,https://dashnews.org/why-buying-coffee-with-bitcoin-wont-get-cryptocurreny-mass-adoption/,"This post is also available in: Deutsch

Coffee. It’s a beverage of mythical reputation in parts of the cryptocurrency community. It has the power, when purchased with cryptocurrency, suddenly renders that currency a commonly-accepted medium of exchange for all purposes, leading to the collapse of the central banking system and possibly the state itself.

Or not. I buy my coffee with Dash. Quite a few have bought theirs with another form of cryptocurrency. Yet, this has not significantly moved the needle forward towards adopting it as a new payment system. It’s a great step, but new people just aren’t lining up to get cryptocurrency so they can spend it on their favorite caffeinated beverage. Something’s clearly missing in how mass adoption is being approached.

Cryptocurrency adoption has taken a backwards approach

Strangely enough, most cryptocurrency adoption efforts have gone in the opposite direction of the proper model. Many adoption advocates have focused on retail adoption, in getting mom-and-pop mainstream shops to accept it, as well as larger retailers. This was probably targeted for symbolic or sentimental value, where being able to buy the proverbial crypto coffee signifies that this has become a regular part of economic life, but has always struggled with the same problem: not enough user demand. No one is lining up to spend it in everyday life except for the few hardcore fans, giving businesses little incentive to continue to accept it, and no reason to expect numbers of customers paying with this method to increase.

Now, using cryptocurrencies such as payments, and particularly Dash, does improve the payment experience from higher security to lower fees, and eventually the superior money and payment system will prove more attractive than legacy options. However, in the interim the difference between the two experiences is simply not great enough to provide a compelling reason to switch, and in many cases can provide disincentives due to the additional effort and costs associated with acquiring and offloading cryptocurrency.

Identifying powerful use cases, and building easy start-to-finish funnels, is necessary

What is needed for cryptocurrencies to build real adoption and regular economic use is to identify strong deficiencies in the current economic system and target them aggressively. These can be any of the situations where the paying experience is poor, from high-chargeback and expensive fee industries such as online gaming and remittances to areas with currency problems such as hyperinflation-plagued nations in South America, Africa and elsewhere. In these areas, there exists a significant enough gap between the experience of paying with fiat currency and legacy systems and using cryptocurrency to warrant a change.

However, a compelling use case alone isn’t enough. An industrious entrepreneur must find a way to turn an opportunity to use this particular tool into an all-in-one product that’s easily accessible to the targeted customer. For example, taking the use case of remittances, a potential user must be able to acquire and send funds via cryptocurrency cheaply and easily, with a one-stop shop approach where they can visit a single vendor and be walked through the entire process without complications. Distilling the rather complicated process of buying, sending, receiving, and selling digital funds all into a neat, easy to understand, and cost-effective user flow is a tricky business, and in particular may require the creation of specific liquidity providers and other tools to facilitate this process. But make no mistake, it’s necessary to make this whole adoption thing work.

Mass adoption comes piggybacking off of stronger use cases

In a mass adoption scenario, people will buy their coffee with crypto. In fact, if they can’t use it for that and other similar day-to-day regular purchases, adoption will fall flat on its face. They’ll simply go for it as a secondary effect of already having gotten on board for a much more specific purpose. Get your decentralized digital cash to send remittances, use what you have left for regular purchases. Eventually stop acquiring fiat because you don’t need it for much anymore. That’s how the model works. The large network of participating merchants must be there ahead of time to catch and amplify new users, but won’t generate those users on their own.

Solve someone’s critical problem with digital cash. After it’s all said and done, maybe they’ll use some of that to buy a hot cup of joe.",2019-10-06 14:14:26+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-news-from-brazil-sept-30oct-6-in-review,"Brazil saw another week of reports on alleged cryptocurrency scams as the Sao Paulo Court ordered to block the assets managed by Unick Forex, while another firm was reported of promising 400% returns through a cryptocurrency investment scheme.

Here is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph Brasil.

Unick Forex reportedly flees offices but apparently will resume operations

Following a police investigation of purported investment scheme Unick Forex, staff reportedly fled the firm’s offices with computers and other hardware in tow. Cointelegraph Brasil reported on Sept. 20 that, according to the administrators of the building that housed the company, the rooms that belonged to Unick have already been handed over and are ready to be rented.

On Oct. 1, Leidimar Lopes, the president of Unick Forex, published an official statement claiming that the firm will continue to operate as normal, following a purported upgrade to the platform. The executive stressed that the firm will pay its customers through an extrajudicial agreement, promising that all clients will be able to withdraw their funds as requested.

In the statement, Lopes noted that Unick Forex is not an investment platform, but rather an educational platform for sharing content in areas such as online marketing, personal finance, financial markets and cryptocurrencies.

Unick Forex’s assets blocked by court

Subsequently, the Sao Paulo Court of Justice reportedly ordered to block the assets managed by Unick Forex, granting an urgent injunction request to a client that complained about delay withdrawals from the platform. According to a court order published on Oct. 3, Unick Forex is free to appeal the decision.

Unick Forex was previously ordered to pay $28,500 to a client who filed a lawsuit against the company for a delay in platform withdrawals.

Leaked: GBB CEO owns 25,000 Bitcoin

Also this week, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the CEO of Brazilian cryptocurrency firm Grupo Bitcoin Banco (GBB) claimed 25,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth $196 million at press time, in a 2018 filing with the Department of Federal Revenue in 2019.

As suggested by legal experts, CEO Claudio Oliveira’s personal funds could potentially be used to cover the GBB’s debt to its customers. The alleged fact of Oliveira holding over $200 million in crypto was unveiled amid GBB’s legal issues and an ongoing police investigation, as reported in late August.

New investigation of YouXWallet

On Sept. 30, Cointelegraph Brasil reported on another alleged crypto pyramid scheme operating in Brazil and Portugal. YouXWallet, an Estonia-based forex and crypto exchange, is reportedly accused of operating a financial pyramid promising a 400% return to investors, according to an investigation by multi-level marketing (MLM) research firm Behind MLM.

According to reports, YouXWallet is already being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil (CVM) as the firm is suspected to be involved in a financial pyramid scheme.",,https://www.ft.com/content/b8af083c-e6bd-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc,"Become an FT subscriber to read:

Fusion Bank (also behind Fusion Coin XFC) intends to distribute its ‘banking system as a white label service for free-to exchanges around the world, enabling them to offer all the same services as Fusion Bank, and utilising its banking license’.

Japanese billionaire Kenji Manno – the man who first brought Ripple to Japan and founded Bitcoin Japan – will launch the new venture and outline the details at CC Forum in London next week.

Fusion Coin was in the headlines last week for the theft of 13.5 million Fusion Coins.

Crypto banking will help rehabilitate industry’s image

Fusion Bank blends traditional finance with disruptive cryptocurrencies.

It will offer cryptocurrency trading (OTC and exchange), FX trading, loans secured with cryptocurrencies, and regular banking services for 25 different fiat currencies including issuing Mastercards and Visas.

Mr Manno, CEO, told Micky that bringing cryptocurrency into the traditional banking sector, will help rehabilitate its image.

“I think Fusion Bank will create a sensation for an obsolete current bank (sector),” he said.

“I believe that the status of cryptocurrency will rise as banks handle cryptocurrencies.”

“I would like to distribute this banking system for free to the exchanges around the world with the bank license attached.”

Work on the bank is almost complete, with the final touches to be finished in November.

Max Studennikov, co-founder of CC Forum in London, told the Trader Cobb podcast the launch was of major significance.

“Mr Manno, he’s a Japanese billionaire, he’s coming to London, he’s chosen us to launch his one billion crypto bank,” Studennikov said.

“You’ll certainly hear a lot of things about it.”

McAfee DEX is set to run in a beta release status as of Oct. 7, according to the new platform’s official website and McAfee’s personal Twitter feed.

“Centralized exchanges are our weak point”

On Oct. 5, McAfee’s tweet unveiled the new platform, stating that “it takes time for enough users to join to make it real, but if you play, and be patient,” the exchange can serve as “the door that frees us from Government's cornerstone of control: Fiat currencies. It can't be shut down.”

In an embedded video, McAfee argues that the cryptocurrency community faces the question of whether its aspirations are limited to merely expanding the possibilities for pure speculation — “all about money” — or are about an ideal, namely freedom.

After denouncing governments’ control over fiat currencies and the losses this presents to individual liberty, McAfee turned to the crypto space: “centralized exchanges are our weak point,” he said, pointing to China’s move to shutter domestic exchanges in September 2017.

McAfee continued:

“A distributed exchange can’t be shut down by anyone. Decentralized meaning that nobody controls it, distributed meaning that it is everywhere and therefore impossible to stop. We’ve had privacy coins, that’s the other part of this equation, because privacy coins with decentralized, distributed exchanges is the goose that lays the golden egg for us. We don’t use it though.”

McAfee DEX beta: the details

According to the details released so far, McAfee DEX reportedly will entail no Know Your Customer checks, block no jurisdictions and charge a single platform fee of 0.25% for takers. It will not charge maker fees and will also reportedly be open sourced.

Any ETH-based token (ERC-20 standard) can be added without a fee to the beta version, with more unspecified tokens to be supported in the future.

“Don’t expect miracles”

In his Oct. 5 video, McAfee pointed to the low number of traders currently using decentralized exchanges, considering that this makes them “useless.” For his DEX, McAfee urged users:

“Play with it, don’t expect miracles at first. Play with it until it becomes real.”

As Cointelegraph previously reported, non-custodial decentralized crypto exchanges enable users to trade peer-to-peer, using smart contracts to automate deal matching and asset liquidation in order to allow users’ funds to remain under their control.

As of January 2019, a survey of over 400 international crypto exchanges indicated that decentralized platforms accounted for just 19% of the global exchange ecosystem, and their trading volumes amounted to less than 1% of those on centralized exchanges.

This April, major centralized exchange Binance launched its own DEX on its native mainnet.

Bitfinex and a number of affiliated entities engaged in deceptive, anti-competitive and market-manipulating practices, resulting in economic damages for the plaintiffs, according to a lawsuit filed Sunday in New York.

Notably, the plaintiffs, who seek class-action status, claim that the total damages add up to more than $1 trillion, writing:

“Calculating damages at this stage is premature, but there is little doubt that the scale of harm wrought by the Defendants is unprecedented. Their liability to the putative class likely surpasses $1.4 trillion U.S. dollars.”

The lawsuit, filed by David Leibowitz, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, Aaron Leibowitz and Pinchas Goldshtein, are represented by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche – the lawyers who recently won a federal case against Craig Wright. Bitfinex, Tether, Digfinex and current executives; former chief strategy officer Philip Potter; and payment processor Crypto Capital are named as defendants in the case.

“The crimes committed by Tether, Bitfinex, Crypto Capital, and their executives include Bank Fraud, Money Laundering; Monetary Transactions Derived From Specified Unlawful Activities, Operating an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business, and Wire Fraud,” the filing says.

In the complaint, the plaintiffs further claim Bitfinex and Tether “shared false information about USDT being backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars,” referring to an allegation made by the New York Attorney General’s office in April. It continues to allege the USDT was used to purchase bitcoin to inflate the crypto market, spurring the 2017-2018 bull market and subsequent bust.

In a statement sent to CoinDesk after this article was published, David Leibowitz said, “As someone who has been invested in bitcoin and the growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, I believe that bad actors in this space have stunted development and consumer confidence.”

Market manipulation?

In response to a request for comment, Bitfinex/Tether spokesperson Joe Morgan sent CoinDesk a statement published over the weekend, which stated that the companies expected a lawsuit based on “an unpublished and non-peer reviewed paper falsely positing that Tether issuances are responsible for manipulating the cryptocurrency market.”

It went on to add:

“Tether and its affiliates have never used Tether tokens or issuances to manipulate the cryptocurrency market or token pricing. All Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves and are issued pursuant to market demand, and not for the purpose of controlling the pricing of crypto assets. It is irresponsible to suggest that Tether enables illicit activity due to its efficiency, liquidity and wide-scale applicability within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.”

In a statement, Roche said, “There was an enormous amount of work put in by the lawyers of our firm, particularly by Joseph Delich, to research the facts related to the conduct outlined in our complaint. I look forward to working with my team as the litigation plays out.”

Allegations that Tether has been used to manipulate the cryptocurrency market have circulated for more than a year. In a study published last June, researchers with the University of Texas at Austin said bitcoin’s price rose after the “the Bitfinex exchange use[d] tether to purchase bitcoin when prices are falling.”

The U.S. Department of Justice is reportedly looking into the allegations, though it is unclear if the Department has drawn any conclusions at this time.

However, another study published last September by University of Queensland professor Wang Chun Wei found that while “tether grants were potentially timed to follow bitcoin downturns,” the actual correlation was “not statistically significant.”

The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has been relentlessly scrutinizing cryptocurrency startups and investigations are up 74% from last year. Meanwhile, proponents of decentralized software development models and open collaboration are upset about the FCA aiming to extend KYC/AML regulations to the publication of open source and zero-knowledge software.

Since 2018, FCA Investigations Into Crypto Companies Increased by 74%

The Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. has been ramping up regulations toward digital currency operations based in the region. It started escalating last year when a few eminent U.K.-based wealth management firms asked the FCA to add strict regulatory policy toward digital currency companies. At the time, Simon Miller, Scalable Capital’s CEO, showed his dislike for the crypto industry. “People see the explosion of digital currencies and say ‘I can make a lot of money quickly.’ But that’s not investing — that’s gambling. It needs to be looked at,” Miller explained. Two other wealth management firm executives from Wealthify and Nutmeg agreed with Miller. The regulatory watchdog had already been setting guidelines and standards for the crypto industry and warned the public about cryptocurrency-based CFDs (contracts for difference).

Now reports show the FCA has increased its investigations into digital currency operations by 74% and is currently investigating 87 crypto startups this year. Last year, the percentage of investigations was lower, but the initial coin offering (ICO) phase was still in full swing. Pinsent Masons executive David Heffron supplied the research to the Financial Times which reported on the “sharp rise in watchdog scrutiny of U.K. cryptocurrency groups.” The FCA has been contemplating banning digital currency-based derivatives products as well and discussed the subject on October 3. Orrick law firm’s Jacqui Hatfield called the FCA conversation a “knee-jerk reaction” and emphasized that “crypto-derivatives are just as risky as other derivatives.”

The FCA’s Guidance on Crypto Assets Raises Concerns

The latest news from the FCA’s investigations follows the regulator’s recent “Guidance on Cryptoassets” report published in the summer. The FCA’s research, feedback and final guidance statements show the regulator isn’t too keen on digital currency operations. In the report, the FCA proposes extending KYC/AML and CTF (anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing) rules to crypto companies residing in the U.K. The regulations would mandate companies like exchanges, wallet operators, and token issuers to collect user information. “A combination of market immaturity, volatility, and a lack of credible information or oversight raises concerns about market integrity, manipulation and insider dealing within cryptoasset markets,” the FCA’s report declares. “This may prevent the market from functioning effectively and damage its reputation.” The FCA’s researchers continued:

The aim of the Guidance is to clarify what is regulated by the FCA, where regulation applies and what this means for firms. This means that firms that carry on regulated activities will need to be authorised. Firms and other market participants will also need to make sure they know, and comply with, the relevant regulatory obligations that apply to them.

Extending KYC/AML Practices to Open Source Publication and Noncustodial Operations

In addition to the operations that deal with cryptocurrencies, the FCA is concerned with crypto-related open source and zero-knowledge (noncustodial) software. The FCA wants to target “the publication of open-source software” the report suggests and the open collaboration mandate includes “but is not limited to, noncustodial wallet software and other types of cryptoasset related software.”

UK's FCA seeks to extend AML regulations to publication of open source software.https://t.co/ljtWZro3Bv pic.twitter.com/w2Ur7h7y5g — Tamas Blummer (@TamasBlummer) October 4, 2019

Essentially the regulator wants crypto firms to divulge user information even if the platform is noncustodial. This means companies that don’t even have oversight of people’s stored cryptocurrencies and have no idea how these individuals transact must comply with the FCA’s strict rules. It will be interesting to see how they can apply this regulation to a wallet operator, when the platform creator has zero knowledge of its user base. The U.K. watchdog’s report also said that many groups from the “financial services sector and beyond” supported the FCA’s proposals. The guideline proposal shows that not only were wealth management firms begging the FCA for strict guidelines last year, but also large banks, trade associations, consultancies, technology firms, academia, and other government entities.

No matter how much Steven Mnuchin or top regulators criticize Bitcoin, crypto is not associated with criminals and amateur speculators anymore. Katie Haun, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is another good example to prove this stance.

First Female Partner at Horowitz

CNBC recently shared the story of Katie Haun, which involves some striking twists.

Currently, Haun co-heads Horowitz’s $350 million cryptocurrency fund. However, previously, she worked for the US Department of Justice as a prosecutor. While she used to track corrupt politicians, prison gangs, and criminals, at one point she had to find ways to ban Bitcoin.

Haun stated:

They said ‘we have this perfect assignment for you’ — there’s this thing called bitcoin and we need to investigate it. That was the first time I’d ever heard of bitcoin.

As the years passed, what was a perfect assignment for a prosecutor turned into a perfect innovation to build the career around.

Haun has become the most popular investor in the crypt0 space, being nicknamed “the credible face of crypto.”

What Caused the Mind Change Towards Crypto?

It’s worth mentioning that Katie Haun is not an isolated case. Many experienced investors and Wall Street veterans initially rejected Bitcoin as a technology worthy of consideration. But most of them seemed to have reasons to stay reluctant. Think about it – a technology that you never heard of reaches the hands of money launderers and criminals on the dark web.

However, Katie Haun gradually figured out that Bitcoin was simply an instrument and that the cryptocurrency itself hadn’t required probing. Criminals could also use the Internet or fiat currencies, but this doesn’t mean they should be banned.

In fact, Bitcoin was structured in a way that actually helped her team easily track the funds. Blockchain made it easier to track down criminal activity than credit cards or bank accounts.

She concluded,

The government was able to use that same technology to actually track down criminal activity it might not otherwise have been able to. Without the technology underlying bitcoin, we never would have been able to catch those people

She turned into a crypto expert but never thought about working for the cryptocurrency industry. Nevertheless, soon after she decided to end her work for the federal government, she joined the board of Coinbase and eventually became the co-head of Horowitz’s crypto fund.

What’s even more interesting, Katie Haunt and her venture capital firm are supporting Facebook’s Libra project, which faces serious scrutiny from regulators. She said:

What we heard with Libra were the same criticisms. They were just heightened and they got more attention because of the high-profile nature of the project and the fact that Facebook was involved. I think it would be a really dangerous thing, and frankly a dangerous precedent to start shutting down technology before it’s built.

Regulatory environment and markets research, however, lag these developments.

In general, there is no consensus in the markets and amongst regulatory authorities as to the preferred classification of cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Some jurisdictions define them as commodities, others as currencies, or even as general assets, without a singular definition. For example, the U.S. Security Exchange Commission (SEC) view cryptocurrencies as belonging to two different asset classes, simultaneously: cryptotokens issued in the primary market representing securities, while the same tokens traded in the secondary markets constituting currencies.

Likewise, the new asset class lacks definitive theoretical framework for analysing the valuations of the cryptocurrencies in relation to financial and economic fundamentals. Dynamic and distributional properties of cryptocurrencies clearly indicate that the mainstream efficient markets hypothesis (EMH hereafter) framework used in traditional investment markets fails to hold in the crypto markets. The EMH is an investment theory that states it is impossible to ‘beat the market’ because asset market efficiency causes existing asset prices to reflect all relevant information.

Looking for a comprehensive theoretical framework

In an attempt to provide a more realistic description of this market, Peters (2015) used the fractal market hypothesis (FMH hereafter). FMH assumes that market stability is preserved when the agents trading in the markets make self-similar decisions that span across different investment time horizons, providing market liquidity (Kristoufek, 2013b). When the long-term investors either stop trading or shorten their investment time horizon, the market becomes unstable leading to periods of high volatility (Roch, 2011). The dominance of a single time horizon in the FMH setting would therefore undermine the market liquidity and cause severe corrections (e.g. flash crashes), as well as large and longer-term events, such as those experienced in the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 (Kristoufek, 2013a).

The FMH proposes the following assumptions:

The market is stable when it consists of investors covering a wide range of investment horizons; Market sentiment and technical factors are more relevant to investors in the short-term. As investment horizons widen, long-term fundamental information tends to dominate; If an event occurs that makes the validity of fundamental information questionable, long-term investors will either stop participating in the market or begin trading based on the short-term information set. When the average investment horizon in the market declines to a uniform level, the market becomes unstable; Prices reflect a combination of short-term technical trading and long-term fundamental valuation. Therefore, short-term price changes are more likely to be the result of crowd behaviour, and subject to greater volatility; and If a security has no tie to the economic cycle, then there will be no long-term trend. Speculative trading, liquidity risk concerns and short-term information will dominate investors’ decisions.

To-date, only Delfin-Vidal and Romero-Meléndez (2016) provide a rigorous test of FMH application to the new cryptocurrencies asset class, and only in the context of bitcoin. There is no literature that provides tests of FMH in the cryptocurrencies across both fractal and wavelet methodologies, simultaneously. Additionally, no study has attempted to extend FMH framework to the analysis of the largest cryptocurrencies (by market capitalisation) beyond the bitcoin.

Our study fills this gap in the literature by developing a comprehensive analysis of the three largest cryptocurrencies across the main dimensions of FMH. We deploy fractal and wavelet analysis methodologies to daily prices data for bitcoin, ethereum and ripple starting from January 2011. To add robustness to our methodology, we utilise a range of wavelet analysis tools to test how bitcoin, ethereum and ripple prices co-vary over time. These methods help establish the full extent of evidence concerning the FMH nature of the three cryptocurrencies across both dynamic fractal domain and time-frequency power spectrum analysis, providing a novel contribution to the literature on cryptocurrencies and expanding our understanding of the FMH.

Confirming the FMH

First, our results lead to the conclusion that bitcoin presents evidence of long memory, as well as cyclical persistency/anti-persistency behaviour. This cyclical behaviour has been smoothing overtime, which can be explained by a maturing market for bitcoin and an increase in the number of investors with a long-term investment horizon who are sensitive to the opportunity cost of selling bitcoin. The latter aspect is especially pronounced during the last up-trend in 2017. Such evidence of increasing maturity in the markets is not present for the other two largest cryptocurrencies.

Despite this evidence for emerging maturity, bitcoin dynamics continue to be consistent with a ‘true Hurst process’, presenting no stable relationship with economic fundamentals and infinite memory. This implies that bitcoin pricing is dominated by crowd behaviour and technical information used by speculators, confirming FMH assumption 4 above.

Globally, we have found that volatility and momentum in market prices at the start of each boom-bust cycle act as triggers for further price appreciations. This reflects strong herding of investors, consistent with the fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) fallacy.

Power spectra also show evidence of a cascade effect, that is, where the new trend, starting from short-time traders operating on technical information and news, is subsequently strengthened by the involvement of investors with longer time horizons, confirming FMH assumption 5 above. All of this suggests that cryptocurrency markets remain vulnerable to mis-pricing on foot of investors behavioural biases, such as regret aversion, herding, anchoring, and availability and status quo heuristics.

Investors’ perspective

From investors’ perspective, we show that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency to hold a promise of improved efficiency and increasing potential for fundamentals-based asset pricing, although eight years into its existence, that promise remains weak. In contrast, both ethereum and ripple continue to be dominated by speculative short-termism and herding bias. Despite these developments, all major cryptocurrencies remain detached from economic and financial fundamentals, presenting a range of problems for fundamentals-focused long-term investors. Finally, in more recent data (from August 2016 on), we detect a positive relationship between bitcoin and ethereum, bitcoin and ripple, and ethereum and ripple. In this relationship, bitcoin leads other cryptocurrencies at low frequencies, providing some support to the investors’ view that it offers better opportunities for longer term investment in the broader cryptocurrency asset class.

The Supreme Court of India has confirmed a new date to hear the crypto case after multiple delays. During the last hearing, the court directed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to reply to crypto exchanges’ representation within two weeks, which the central bank has done.

New Date – Top of the Board

The Indian supreme court has scheduled a new date to resume hearing the arguments against the banking ban on crypto businesses. A recently released court order shows that the case was called for hearing last week and a new date was set. The order reads:

Upon hearing the counsel, the court made the following order … List on Tuesday, the 15th October, 2019 on top of the board.

Being listed on top of the board means that the case will be the first one the judges will hear on Oct. 15, immensely improving its chance of moving forward. The case was originally scheduled to be heard on Sept. 25 but was repeatedly postponed. A few days last week, it was listed far down the list, with little chance of being called for hearing.

RBI Has Replied to IAMAI’s Representation

The supreme court started hearing the arguments to remove the RBI’s banking ban in detail in early August. The hearing went on for several days, which the central bank’s power over crypto was extensively challenged.

During the hearing on Aug. 21, the court directed the central bank to reply to crypto exchanges’ detailed representation, submitted by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). It explains that there is no need for a banking ban, suggesting instead a number of alternative measures such as applying the Money Laundering Act to crypto exchanges as intermediaries with necessary requirements. The RBI, however, responded by saying that it forwarded the representation to the government. After hearing the arguments, the court determined that the central bank did not adequately answer the points made in the representation and directed it to do so within two weeks.

According to reports, the central bank has complied within the given timeframe as directed by the supreme court, and its reply was in-depth. The IAMAI has also reportedly prepared a response to the RBI’s reply.

The RBI issued a circular in April last year, banning banks from providing services to crypto businesses. A number of industry stakeholders immediately filed writ petitions to remove the ban, which went into effect three months later. Banks subsequently closed accounts of crypto exchanges, forcing some of them to shut down their local exchange operations, including Zebpay and Koinex.

India Mulling Over a Bill to Ban Crypto

Meanwhile, the Indian government is currently deliberating on a draft bill submitted by an interministerial committee (IMC) which proposes a ban on all cryptocurrencies in India, except state-issued ones. The committee was headed by former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg, who has since been reassigned to the Power Ministry. The IMC report containing the draft bill entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019” was published on July 23. “The committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalizing carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India,” the report reads.

The Indian crypto community strongly believes that the bill is flawed and many stakeholders have been campaigning for lawmakers to reexamine the recommendations. Recently, a number of industry leaders met with a member of Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament, to discuss possible courses of action. Member of Parliament Rajeev Chandrasekhar has indicated his willingness to help the crypto community. “I have the ability to create, let us say, documents with your inputs, and have that presented either in parliament or to the government,” he explained.

The RBI’s crypto banking ban has even affected the police, preventing some departments from cashing out seized cryptocurrencies. The central bank has also recently imposed banking restrictions on a cooperative bank with 137 branches across India, including placing a low limit on how much customers can withdraw.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has set an Oct. 13 deadline for approving a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund from Bitwise Investments, a move that could mark a meaningful milestone in bitcoin's long-term growth story.

The digital currency has been volatile this year, falling by over 20% in one week in late September to its lowest level since July amid increasing skepticism and uncertainty. Bitcoin hit its 2019 high of over $11,000 in June, according to cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.

Interestingly, bitcoin is still 2019's best-performing asset, up almost 123% for the year.

That volatility isn't stopping Matt Hougan, managing director and global head of research at Bitwise, from being optimistic about the prospects for his firm's bitcoin ETF, which, if approved, would trade as the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust.

""We're closer than we've ever been before to getting a bitcoin ETF approved,"" Hougan, former CEO of Inside ETFs, said Monday on CNBC's ""ETF Edge.""

""Sometime before Monday, the SEC has to give its decision: yes or no. They have no more ways to postpone it at this point,"" Hougan said. ""We will hear clearly between now and Monday what they think, and then, depending on what we hear, we'll go forward from there. But it should be a very exciting week.""

The road to bitcoin ETF approval has been a long one. The Facebook-famous Winklevoss twins first filed for a bitcoin ETF in 2013, launching a yearslong fight for approval with the SEC that ended in disappointment.

It's also come with a few casualties. In January, a government shutdown threw a wrench in many issuers' plans, with Cboe Global Markets withdrawing its application for a bitcoin-based ETF. In mid-September, VanEck and SolidX followed suit, pulling their proposal for a bitcoin-based ETF from SEC consideration.

But in the last few years, the outlook for Bitwise's proposal has improved significantly, Hougan said.

""The evolution of the bitcoin market over the last two years is from night to day,"" he said Monday, adding that some of the SEC's chief concerns about approving a bitcoin ETF — mainly custody and proper regulation — are starting to get resolved.

""Two years ago, there were no regulated, insured custodians in the bitcoin market. Today, ... there are big names like Fidelity and CoinBase [with] hundreds of millions of dollars of insurance from firms like Lloyd's of London,"" he said. ""Two years ago, there were no regulated crypto exchanges. Now, six of the 10 big crypto exchanges are regulated by the New York Department of State with market surveillance technologies in place. And, most importantly, two years ago, it was a one-sided, inefficient market. Today, we have $200-plus million in volume and regulated futures every day.""

Now, bitcoin is ""among the most efficient institutional markets in the world"" because of its narrow spreads and the involvement of major market makers like Jane Street Capital and Susquehanna, Hougan said.

All of those factors could bring Wall Street one step closer to welcoming the first-ever bitcoin ETF, a long-awaited event that would open up the crypto space to many more buyers, Hougan said.

""The opportunity that's taking place in bitcoin, crypto and blockchain today is one of the most exciting wealth-generation opportunities in the world,"" he said. ""The problem is while big institutions have safe, secure ways to buy bitcoin today in private funds that are available only to the ultra-high-net-worth people, regular investors don't have a safe way.""

A bitcoin ETF would change that layout entirely, the research pro said.

""What the bitcoin ETF would allow everyday investors to do is have safe, simple, secure access to the wealth generation taking place in bitcoin and crypto. It would let financial advisors give it to their clients easily instead of them going rogue,"" Hougan said. ""It's just trying to solve that problem of simple, secure access to what is emerging as a very important technology and a very important asset class in the market.""

Bitcoin was up by about 5% by Monday's stock market close, according to Bitstamp.

On Oct. 8, the Token Analyst wrote that, throughout Bitcoin’s history, the amount of the world’s most popular crypto coins on exchange wallets has consistently been increasing.

The Twitter account, which provides real-time and historical blockchain data, estimated close to 1.2 million coins is currently held in the wallets of eight major exchanges — with the Token Analyst describing them as “the biggest HODLers.”

An accompanying graph shows that Huobi Group is leading the pack of crypto exchanges, with the most amount of BTC in its wallets. Binance and BitMEX are battling it out for second place.

One of the best-known words in the crypto vernacular is having a birthday party on Dec. 18. The word HODL was coined on BitcoinTalk almost six years ago, when Bitcoin started crashing after touching $1,000.

The fall took Bitcoin from over $10,000 to under $8,000 in less than 48 hours.

Fractals are repeating patterns found in everything from nature to the price charts of financial assets. These repeating patterns can tip off crypto analyst and traders through technical analysis, and warn them of coming price movements.

One prominent crypto analyst has spotted some similarities between the recent top in Bitcoin price, which resulted in a multi-month triangle formation. The triangle had a number of peaks and troughs, that match the current price action.

The analyst says that if the fractal continues to be followed, a deep and violent drop like what was experienced in September following the disappointing Bakkt launch may be coming in the days ahead.

If Bitcoin should breakdown from the current structure, and repeat the drop, the analyst says that Bitcoin price will reach $7,000 as a result of the breakdown.

Bear Market Bottom Fractal Gives Bulls Hope in a Rebound

But just as one set of eyes interprets chart patterns one way, another set sees them through a different lens. Another crypto analyst also has spotted a fractal bearing similarities between the current price pattern, and another period that led to a huge move: Bitcoin’s bear market bottom.

According to the pattern in the above chart, price action is currently mimicking the pattern Bitcoin price traded within during its bear market bottom back in early 2019.

At the end of this fractal, Bitcoin price didn’t break down further, it instead broke up with an over $1,000 green candle, that set off a parabolic rally that amounted to over 300% returns for investors who were able to get buy orders in before the rally kicked off.

With both of these fractals, they only bear similarities and aren’t exact duplicates of the price action from either period. Fractals are also often disregarded by crypto analysts, who claim that sticking to them too closely could result in unnecessary bias.

If the fractal from above plays out, then $7,000 would be the next stop for Bitcoin price, however, if the second bera market bottom fractal confirms, Bitcoin could not only revisit $10,000 but could go parabolic once again and return to its bull run.

The lawsuit accuses the groups of managing a sophisticated scheme to defraud investors, manipulate markets, and conceal illicit proceeds. It came just a day after the two companies notified users of an imminent legal action which they were trying to frame as a shameless money grab attempt.

According to the complaint, Bitfinex and Tether commingled their corporate identities and customer funds while concealing their extensive cooperation. And they also lied to investors saying that the number of USDT tokens in circulation will always be the same as the number of dollars in the companies’ bank accounts. This allegedly gave them the power to fake market demand for cryptocurrencies by just printing more USDT and using it to buy coins.

“Tether issued extraordinary amounts of unbacked USDT to manipulate cryptocurrency prices. Because the market believed the lie that one USDT equaled one U.S. dollar, Bitfinex and Tether had the power to, and did, manipulate the market on an unprecedented scale to profit from boom-and-bust cycles they created.”

Over $1.4 Trillion in Damages

The amount of influence over the crypto market that the lawsuit assigns to the stablecoin is incredible. It states that from 2017 to 2018, Tether printed 2.8 billion USDT and used it to flood the Bitfinex exchange which artificially inflated demand for cryptocurrencies and caused prices to spike. Economists cited by the complaint estimate that as much as half the growth in the cryptocurrency market at that time was driven by this manipulative scheme.

“As the cryptocurrency market reached a fever pitch, Tether’s mass issuance of USDT created the largest bubble in human history. When it burst, over $450 billion of value disappeared in less than a month.”

According to the accusations the fallout from the crash when the USDT-infused bubble burst continues to affect the cryptocurrency market today, by causing prices to be lower than they would have been but for the market manipulation. And Tether and Bitfinex are said to continue to defraud the public these days, even in the face of an ongoing investigation by the New York Attorney General, the CFTC, and the Department of Justice. As for the potential compensation or settlement that the class action will seek, the lawyers state that calculating damages at this stage is premature, but that they could surpass $1.4 trillion U.S. dollars.

Digital currency markets have started to show strong signs of recovery after dropping to new lows last week. On Monday, a number of cryptocurrencies gained between 2-5% over the course of the day. Crypto prices have held steady into the next day and many digital assets will likely test key resistance levels in order to press forward.

Crypto Markets See Percentage Gains But Strong Resistance Lies Ahead

Last week the cryptoconomy was in a slump and prices dropped sharply on Friday, October 4, and slid even lower two days later on Sunday. On October 6, the price of BTC fell below the $8K region to a low of $7,800 per coin. The following day saw some recovery as crypto bulls started to regain control. Since the big drop on Sunday, roughly $22 billion has been added to the combined market capitalization of all 2,000+ digital assets. On Tuesday, October 8, BTC is trading for $8,238 per coin and is up 0.51%. BTC has an overall market cap of around $148 billion and $16.6 billion in trade volume. These metrics have attributed to BTC dominance (the coin’s market capitalization in relation to the entire cryptoconomy’s valuation) dropping to a low of 66%.

Ethereum (ETH) markets are up 1% and each ETH is swapping for $179. For the last seven days, ETH has gained 0.62% and is currently seeing $7.8 billion in global trade volume. Ripple (XRP) is down today (1.2%) after it gained 10% on Sunday but XRP is still up by 7% for the week. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has managed to knock tether (USDT) out of fourth position on Tuesday. Tether, however, still dominates by global trade volume capturing $4 billion more in trade volume than BTC. Despite the negative headlines in the press, the amount of USDT in circulation has increased to 4,108,044,456 at the time of writing. The stablecoin is paired with dozens of coins and commands around two thirds of every crypto trade on October 8.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

As mentioned above, BCH has managed to capture the number four spot with a market valuation of around $4.17 billion. Bitcoin cash is up 2.2% for the week but is down 1% at the time of writing. One BCH is swapping for $231 per coin and there’s around $1.51 billion in global trades today. This puts BCH in seventh position as far as global volume is concerned, just below XRP and above TRX. Data shows the top trading pair with BCH today is tether (USDT) capturing 61% of all trades. This is followed by USD (14%), BTC (13.9%), ETH (6.4%), KRW (2%), JPY (0.47%), and the EUR (0.46%). One interesting fact for BCH is that the SLP-based stablecoin USDH has outpaced USDC pairs against bitcoin cash. On October 8, USDH accounts for 0.19% of all BCH trades.

Fxstreet market analyst John Isige wrote on Monday that BCH/USD bulls have returned their focus on the $250 and $300 range. “The 50 SMA is breaking away from the longer-term 100 SMA to show that the buyers are largely in charge — A short-term trendline is in line to offer the much-needed support to pull BCH above $250 and further towards $300,” Isige explained. “The full stochastic oscillator is making a re-entrance above 70 (overbought region) signifying an improving technical picture and stronger momentum.”

Bitwise Researcher Believes a Bitcoin ETF Is Imminent

Bitwise head of research Matt Hougan believes a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is closer to reality than ever before. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to make a decision on whether it will approve a bitcoin-based ETF from Bitwise Investments. Hougan says he’s optimistic in regards to the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust being approved and he believes it will be a milestone.

“We’re closer than we’ve ever been before to getting a bitcoin ETF approved,” Hougan said during an interview on Monday on CNBC’s ETF Edge broadcast. “Sometime before Monday, the SEC has to give its decision: yes or no. They have no more ways to postpone it at this point,” Hougan insisted. “We will hear clearly between now and Monday what they think, and then, depending on what we hear, we’ll go forward from there. But it should be a very exciting week.” Many speculators think that the upcoming ETF decision is directly attributed to the rise in crypto prices. After rejecting countless bitcoin ETF attempts in the past, the SEC plans to make its decision on the Bitwise ETF on October 13, 2019.

Renko Patterns Show Continued Downtrend

The crypto analyst known as Cold Blooded Shiller believes BTC prices will continue following the downtrend which started after prices attempted to surpass the $14K mark and then consolidated around the $9,500 to $10,500 zone. While sharing a chart showing the BTC daily Renko, Shiller said the “downtrend is in full swing.” Renko charts, however, are unconventional and they are used to track the price movement in contrast to intervals of time. Rengas or brick patterns are added to the chart when the price moves toward a specific target and shows an interesting perspective of market outlooks. Some traders believe in Renko patterns because they sift out unnecessary price movements.

Monetary Easing, Safe-Haven Assets, and 2019’s Market Performances

Despite all the scary headlines and central bankers like the Federal Reserve initiating a domino effect of monetary easing practices, some economists believe the economy is not that terrible. For instance, in the U.S. an investment strategist at BCA Research, Doug Peta, told the public that the labor market “remains vibrant enough to exert downward pressure on the unemployment rate, and services continue to expand despite the contraction in manufacturing, both here and abroad.” This was followed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics disclosing that the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 1969.

Nevertheless, a few data points do not outweigh the massive number of speculators who believe the economy will falter very soon. This has put the spotlight on safe haven assets like gold, which remains above the $1,500 spot price per ounce. However, even with the year-long gold rally seeing prices spike by 20%, Goldman Sachs has called BTC the best-performing asset class in 2019.

According to a lawsuit filed in New York over the weekend, Bitfinex and Tether “engaged in unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading acts” by failing to disclose that Tether was not backed 1:1 to by the US dollar.

Other defendants named in the suit include Digfinex (the majority owner of Bitfinex and Tether)and its current executives, payment processor Crypto Capital, and Bitfinex’s former chief strategy officer Phil Potter, who reportedly left the company in January last year.

“The Tether and Bitfinex Defendants have systematically perpetrated deceptive and unfair practices upon members of the public and have intentionally deceived the market,” the document adds.

The plaintiffs, cryptocurrency traders David Leibowitz, Benjamin Leibowitz, Jason Leibowitz, Aaron Leibowitz, and Pinchas Goldshtein estimate the damages at more than $1 trillion.

“Calculating damages at this stage is premature, but there is little doubt that the scale of harm wrought by the Defendants is unprecedented,” they claim. “Their liability to the putative class likely surpasses $1.4 trillion US dollars.”

“The crimes committed by Tether, Bitfinex, Crypto Capital, and their executives include Bank Fraud, Money Laundering; Monetary Transactions Derived From Specified Unlawful Activities, Operating an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business, and Wire Fraud,” the filing says.

It’s not the first time Tether makes headlines for unsavory reasons. Back in May, Tether admitted it used its reserves to buy Bitcoin and other “assets.”

At the time, court documents detailed how New York Supreme Court Judge Joel M. Cohen was becoming increasingly suspicious of Bitfinex’s and Tether’s dealings – especially after both companies fessed up that the stablecoin wasn’t entirely backed by cash, contrary to its marketing claims.

More recently, the New York Attorney General (NYSAG) ruled that Bitfinex could stop sharing documents about its use of Tether in an entirely different case.

The decision was taken after the exchange won a motion over an alleged $850 million cover-up.

Tether has long been at the center of rumors and conspiracy theories amongst industry insiders, and this additional (and suspiciously frivolous) class action lawsuit isn’t likely to make things easier for the world’s most popular stablecoin.",2019-10-08,https://www.investmentexecutive.com/news/industry-news/quadrigacx-founders-widow-to-hand-over-assets-in-settlement/,"The funds are only a fraction of the $214.6 million in cash and cryptocurrency that more than 76,000 unsecured users have claimed following the collapse of the exchange after Cotten’s death last December.

The online exchange, which launched in 2013 and grew to become one of Canada’s largest with 363,000 customers, offered a platform for trading and storing digital assets like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum.

The exchange was already facing liquidity issues before the death of Cotten, who was chief executive and sole director, but employees found they were unable to locate or access most of the cryptocurrency assets after he died.

An investigation by creditor monitor Ernst and Young found the exchange had flawed financial reporting and that significant volumes of cryptocurrency had been transferred to personal accounts controlled by Cotten. It found losses from trading and fees in those accounts affected QuadrigaCX’s reserves, while Cotten also created fake accounts on QuadrigaCX to inflate revenue figures.

Robertson said in a statement that she wasn’t aware of how her husband operated the business, or his appropriation of users funds.

“I had no direct knowledge of how Gerry operated the business prior to his death, and was not aware of his improper actions in managing the QuadrigaCX business.”

The monitor said that to its knowledge, neither Cotten nor Robertson had material sources of income other than funds received from QuadrigaCX, though neither reported income from the company on tax returns in recent years.

Robertson said that she has agreed to return assets she thought were purchased with legitimately earned proceeds from the company.

“I was upset and disappointed with Gerry’s activities as uncovered by the investigation when I first learned of them, and continue to be,” she said.

Robertson will be able to keep about $90,000 in cash, $20,000 in retirement savings, a Jeep, and some jewelry and furnishings as part of the settlement.

The assets handed over by Robertson will add to the roughly $32 million in cash plus $1 million in cryptocurrency that Ernst and Young has already recovered from QuadrigaCX.

Robertson said she hopes the settlement will allow users to be repaid as much as possible while keeping fees as low as possible.

“I believe this settlement is a fair and equitable resolution for QCX and the affected users…in return, this settlement will allow me to move on with the next chapter of my life.”",2019-10-08 19:53:15-04:00,https://www.coindesk.com/unicef-launches-cryptocurrency-fund-to-back-open-source-technology,"UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, has launched a crypto fund to receive, hold and distribute donations of bitcoin and ether in its aim to back open source technology for children around the world.

UNICEF said in an announcement on Wednesday that in a first for United Nations organizations, the Cryptocurrency Fund will receive contributions in cryptocurrency and grant out in the same digital currency form.

The organization added the first contributions to the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund come from the Ethereum Foundation and “will benefit three grantees of the UNICEF Innovation Fund.”

It said the three grantees that will receive the initial donations are Prescrypto, Atix Labs and Utopixar, focusing on the areas of “prescription tracking, matching investors and those needing funding, and community tokens and engagement.”

Aya Miyaguchi, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, said in a keynote speech at the DevCon event that 100 ether, worth about $18,000 at its current price, has been sent to the UNICEF via the new partnership.

“This is a new and exciting venture for UNICEF,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “If digital economies and currencies have the potential to shape the lives of coming generations, it is important that we explore the opportunities they offer. ”

“Together with UNICEF, we’re taking action with the Crypto Fund to improve access to basic needs, rights, and resources,” Miyaguchi said in the announcement.

The UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund is the UN children agency’s latest push to adopt blockchain technology for its wider goal. Earlier this year, it was in talks with the government of Kyrgyzstan to use blockchain to provide internet access to schools in the country via the so-called Project Connect initiative.

In December last year, UNICEF said it was investing $100,000 in six blockchain startups in order to solve global challenges via blockchain, ranging from healthcare delivery transparency to managing finances and resources.

The Fed’s decision to expand its balance sheet is seen as a long-term positive development for bitcoin by crypto market experts.

Speculation that SEC might approve ETF application by Bitwise is fueling optimism that more investors could allocate funds to the cryptocurrency.

Prices for ethereum and bitcoin may have gotten a jolt of enthusiasm from an announcement that UNICEF , the United Nations Children’s Fund, would launch a fund to accept donations of bitcoin and ethereum.

Bitcoin (BTC) jumped 5.1 percent on Wednesday to the highest price in three weeks, after the Federal Reserve (Fed) said it would print money to expand the size of bank reserves – seen as a move by the U.S. central bank that could spark inflation.

The top cryptocurrency surged to $8,587.29 as of 19:35 UTC time (3:35 p.m. New York time), according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.

Bitcoin suffered a steep drop in late September, tumbling from above $10,000, a move analysts attributed to big margin calls on the Bitmex exchange and disappointment over the debut of a new futures contract on the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt digital-asset trading platform.

During the monthly futures contract’s first week of trading, it managed to garner just $5 million of total volume, disappointing industry observers who had anticipated a higher uptake from big institutional investors.

But on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will soon start expanding its balance sheet again in an effort to avoid a repeat of the recent turmoil in the money markets. Powell said the Fed may have to keep pumping money into the financial markets by buying securities in the coming days in order to ensure the smooth functioning of short-term lending markets.

Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused investment firm BitBull Capital in San Francisco, said in a phone interview that bitcoin prices typically rise when the Federal Reserve loosens monetary policy – such as earlier this year, when the central bank’s first interest-rate cuts in a decade helped push prices to a 2019 high around $12,900 in late June.

“We know that that has historically helped bitcoin,” DiPasquale said.

Bitcoin prices have more than doubled from where they started 2019, around $3,700.

There’s also speculation in the market that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might approve a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) from Bitwise, which says on its website that it pioneered the first cryptocurrency index fund.

Matt Hougan, the firm’s global head of research, told CNBC on Monday that “we’re closer than we’ve ever been before to getting a bitcoin ETF approved.” A decision is due by Monday, Hougan said.

“There’s some hope in the industry, which would make it much easier for people to purchase bitcoin,” DiPasquale said in the interview with CoinDesk.

DiPasquale said he thinks the proposal might be rejected, which could send bitcoin prices back down below $8,000.

Another factor helping to drive prices higher Wednesday, according to Blockforce Capital Chief Investment Officer David Martin, was an announcement that UNICEF , the United Nations Children’s Fund, would launch a fund to accept donations of bitcoin and ethereum, another cryptocurrency.

“That news broke and that’s what’s popping in the market today,” Martin said in a phone interview.

Ethereum surged 6.4 percent to $190.82.

Martin said that ethereum’s price started moving prior to bitcoin’s surge, perhaps since UNICEF said the first contributions under the new program would come from the Ethereum Foundation.

Some investors and analysts describe the Fed’s latest operation as round four of quantitative easing (QE) – central bank purchases of government securities or other securities from the market to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. The Fed conducted three rounds of quantitative easing between 2009 and 2015.

Many observers are of the opinion that the QE programs are inflationary in nature and consider bitcoin as a hedge against such policies.

A First for UN Organizations

United Nations children’s agency Unicef announced the launch of its cryptocurrency fund Wednesday. The organization explained that “Unicef will now be able to receive, hold and disburse donations of cryptocurrencies ether and bitcoin, through its newly-established Unicef Cryptocurrency Fund,” adding:

In a first for United Nations organizations, Unicef will use cryptocurrencies to fund open source technology benefiting children and young people around the world.

The agency noted that its national committees for the U.S., France, Australia, and New Zealand currently accept crypto donations. In April last year, Unicef also launched The Hopepage, a website that mines cryptocurrency with visitors’ computer processing power. At press time, over 30,800 people are actively donating their computing power to it, according to the website.

First Donations and Grantees

Unicef also revealed that the first contributions to its crypto fund will be made by the Ethereum Foundation, through its French national committee. Three grantees of the Unicef Innovation Fund will benefit from these initial donations, along with a project coordinated by the GIGA initiative to connect schools across the world to the internet.

The Unicef Innovation Fund “invests in solutions that can impact the lives of the most vulnerable children,” its website details. At press time, the fund has invested $5.9 million in 76 projects and 42 countries “with an eye to invest in 20 more start-ups in 2019.”

Christopher Fabian who cofounded Unicef’s Innovation Unit previously explained the importance of being able to prove where donated money is going. “To achieve that level of transparency with cryptocurrencies, organizations will need to be able to receive, manage, and distribute crypto funds without converting them,” he remarked. “In other words, to track where your bitcoin donation went, it has to end up at the point of need still as bitcoin.” For its new venture, Unicef confirmed:

Under the structure of the Unicef Cryptocurrency Fund, contributions will be held in their cryptocurrency of contribution, and granted out in the same cryptocurrency.

The three aforementioned grantees are Prescrypto, Utopixar, and Atix Labs. Prescrypto is building Rexchain, a healthcare blockchain. “Your prescriptions will be stored in an encrypted database, which only you — or the people you choose to share them with — can access,” the team described. Utopixar is working on a decentralized blockchain platform for anyone to collaborate on initiatives addressing social and environmental challenges.

The third grantee, Atix Labs, is a software development company focusing on building a blockchain platform that matches startup enterprises to funders. The firm has teamed up with RSK Labs to form a consortium called the Circles of Angels, which is working on using smart contracts for remittances.

Unicef works across more than 190 countries and territories to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children. “If digital economies and currencies have the potential to shape the lives of coming generations, it is important that we explore the opportunities they offer,” Executive Director Henrietta Fore opined. “That’s why the creation of our cryptocurrency fund is a significant and welcome step forward in humanitarian and development work.”

This story has been updated.",2019-10-09 16:45:20,https://www.coindesk.com/the-irs-just-issued-its-first-cryptocurrency-tax-guidance-in-5-years,"The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has published its first guidance in five years for calculating taxes owed on cryptocurrency holdings.

Industry members have been eagerly awaiting the update since May 2019, when IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said the agency was working on providing fresh guidance. The agency’s 2014 guidance left many questions unanswered, and the crypto market has grown more complex in the years since.

As expected, the guidance notice released Wednesday addresses: the tax liabilities created by cryptocurrency forks; the acceptable methods for valuing cryptocurrency received as income; and how to calculate taxable gains when selling cryptocurrencies.

Drew Hinkes, a lawyer with Carlton Fields and the general counsel to Athena Blockchain, told CoinDesk that “from the tax collector’s standpoint, this is the right answer,” though Certified Public Accountant Kirk Phillips said he was surprised that the guidance basically only addressed forks.

Forks

Resolving a long-standing question, the guidance says new cryptocurrencies created from a fork of an existing blockchain should be treated as “an ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received.”

In other words, tax liabilities will apply when the new cryptocurrencies are recorded on a blockchain – if a taxpayer actually has control over the coins and can spend them.

The document reads:

“If your cryptocurrency went through a hard fork, but you did not receive any new cryptocurrency, whether through an airdrop (a distribution of cryptocurrency to multiple taxpayers’ distributed ledger addresses) or some other kind of transfer, you don’t have taxable income.”

James Mastracchio, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland, told CoinDesk that this applies when there is a distinctly different cryptocurrency as a result of the hard fork.

The IRS language might create more confusion, said Jerry Brito, executive director at Coin Center.

“While the new guidance offers some much-needed clarity on certain questions related to calculating basis, gains, and losses, it seems confused about the nature of hard forks and airdrops,” Brito told CoinDesk, adding:

“One unfortunate consequence of this guidance is that third parties can now create tax reporting obligations for you by simply forking a network whose coins you own, or foisting on you an unwanted airdrop.”

Individuals would be assessed income when they receive the asset, Hinkes said.

“Receipt is defined by ‘dominion and control’ … so it’s ability to transfer, sell, exchange or dispose of the asset according to this guidance,” he said. “The fear is that someone maliciously airdrops and tags you with a giant liability. But [this] fear is a bit oversold because you would only be liable for new income based on the fair market value of the asset when received, and most forks don’t start out with a high valuation.”

Phillips said it was possible that an individual with an ethereum wallet, for example, could receive an ERC-20 token from an airdrop without realizing it. Depending on how the token’s value fluctuates, this may result in them having to pay income tax on an asset that was worth more when they received it than when they sell the asset.

“This can happen when coins hit a high water mark of price discovery right after the airdrop event and the heavy selling could sink the price to a level from which is never recovers,” he said.

The issue has grown more salient in recent years, as fights over protocol changes caused rifts in various crypto communities, leading to splinter currencies like ethereum classic and bitcoin cash.

Holders of the original bitcoin and ethereum could automatically claim a like amount of the new coins, raising the question of whether and under what conditions they would owe taxes on the windfall.

Now crypto holders and their accountants have a roadmap.

Cost basis

The new IRS document also offers long-awaited clarification on how taxpayers can determine the cost basis, or fair market value of coins received as income, such as from mining or the sale of goods and services.

Cost basis should be calculated by summing up all the money spent to acquire the crypto, “including fees, commissions and other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars.”

A third key issue addressed by the new IRS guidance is how to determine the cost basis of each unit of cryptocurrency that is disposed of in a taxable transaction (such as a sale).

This is an issue because someone might buy bitcoin in multiple transactions over a span of years; when they sold some of it, it was unclear which purchase price to use for calculating taxable gains.

The value of the crypto purchased on an exchange is determined by the amount the exchange sold it for in U.S. dollars. The income basis, in this case, will include commissions, fees and other costs of the purchase.

If the crypto is bought on a peer-to-peer exchange or a DEX, it is possible to use a crypto price index to determine the fair market value. In the words of IRS, this can be “a cryptocurrency or blockchain explorer that analyzes worldwide indices of a cryptocurrency and calculates the value of the cryptocurrency at an exact date and time.”

When selling crypto, taxpayers can identify the coins they are disposing of, “either by documenting the specific unit’s unique digital identifier such as a private key, public key, and address, or by records showing the transaction information for all units” in a single account or address, the IRS wrote.

This information, the document states, must show:

“(1) the date and time each unit was acquired, (2) your basis and the fair market value of each unit at the time it was acquired, (3) the date and time each unit was sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, and (4) the fair market value of each unit when sold, exchanged, or disposed of, and the amount of money or the value of property received for each unit.”

The new guidance allows for “first-in, first-out” accounting or specifically identifying when the cryptocurrencies being sold were acquired, Mastracchio said.

“Let’s say I bought my first unit at $5,000 and my second unit at $2,000 and then I sold one of my units. I can identify the unit or I can use ‘first-in, first-out,'” he said. “From a tax planning perspective, you may want to be specific about which unit you sold or you may want to use first-in, first-out because sometimes you want a capital gain and sometimes you might want a loss.”

Other issues

In a disappointment to crypto users who like to spend their coins on everyday purchases like cups of coffee, the IRS specifically said it would not create an exemption for transactions below a certain threshold.

Paying somebody for service will result in a capital gain or loss, which should be calculated as “the difference between the fair market value of the services you received and your adjusted basis in the virtual currency exchanged.”

Purchases of goods and services were deemed taxable when the IRS issued its original guidance in 2014, which said that digital currencies were to be treated as property rather than currency for tax purposes. This discouraged casual spending and made tax season burdensome for users who wanted to diligently report their obligations.

Whether buying, selling or tokenizing real estate, the property market and blockchain are deeply intertwined. As the purchase of property has become possible with bitcoin, so has the wider potential of blockchain technology to transform the industry. The convergence of real estate and cryptocurrency is no longer the stuff of idle speculation, but a growing sector that has already begun to bear fruit.

From Buying It With Bitcoin to Tokenizing It: The Evolution of Real Estate

“Few assets, except for possibly fine art, are more illiquid than real estate,” observes Marvin Steinberg, explaining the conditions that prompted the property industry’s tokenization. The founder of STO advisory firm CPI Tech continues, “If you’ve got a $10 million waterfront development and you want to sell it, you’ve got to find another buyer with $10 million to spare. There aren’t a lot of people with that level of funds on hand. However, take that development, tokenize it, split it into 10 lots, and now you only need to find buyers with $100K to spare. If you need to free up funds at short notice, you don’t have to offload the entire development; now you can liquidate one of those shares, and can even buy it back at a later date.”

The cross-pollination between blockchain and real estate can be traced back to at least 2013 when Ragnar Lifthrasir created the International Blockchain Real Estate Association (IBREA). As a purely educational resource, IBREA may not have grabbed many headlines in its own right, but it indicated that interest between these sectors was already fomenting. That mutual curiosity took some time before it developed into keys and coins being swapped, but when it did one of the trailblazers in the market was Bitpay.

In January 2017, the COO of Bitpay, Sonny Singh, reported that in one property purchase in which the company had been involved, the seller made an extra $1.3 million. As Singh explained it, the property was valued at roughly $4million, but after completion, the price of BTC rose from $750 to $1,000, making the seller a tidy 25%. The rest of 2017 proved to be a good year for the company, which processed $20 million worth of real estate deals. Apart from Bitpay, the bull market of 2017 also saw co-living project The Collective accept bitcoin deposits from September, and in October a London mansion was advertised for £17 million, exclusively for purchase in bitcoin.

Tokenized Real Estate Was Built on a Foundation of Bitcoin

In the U.K., property developer Go Homes began selling new properties in bitcoin by December 2017, with the first sold to a bitcoin miner for £350,000 in Colchester. There were some added complications to completing the purchase in cryptocurrency as Solicitor Adrian Toulson explained to The Telegraph: “The Land Registry agreed in principle that the price could be recorded in bitcoin, but the buyer may well choose to use pounds, simply because calculating any capital gains tax may prove very complicated.”

That sentiment was shared by Natalia Karayaneva, the CEO of real estate management blockchain Propy. As Karayaneva told news.Bitcoin.com in Jan 2019: “The main issue we’ve experienced is exchanging large amounts because sellers, very often, want to get paid in fiat.”

The takeaway is that purchases for real estate have been entirely possible in bitcoin for some time, but not without some degree of complication as the law and other institutions have played catch up to technology. As the number of successfully completed purchases has grown, however, the foundations have been laid for the next generation of bitcoin property purchases. Only this week, the developers of Goldwynn, a major new development in the Bahamas, announced they would be accepting cryptocurrency including bitcoin cash. Prices for the luxury beachfront condos range from around $500K to $4M.

The Emergence of Tokenized Real Estate

As the broader crypto industry has moved from ICOs towards IEOs and STOs, the way in which blockchain projects interact with legacy industries has also changed. This is particularly true of real estate. As Marvin Steinberg explains it, “Real estate is very capital intensive. The cap rate, as it’s known, is the ratio of Net Operating Income to property asset value. If you can lower the cap from a five down to, say, a four, that’s extremely attractive. Given the ability for tokenization of real estate to lower capital costs while increasing liquidity, it was natural that this should become the first industry where security tokens gain a foothold.” He adds:

In the future, I think we’ll see everything from sports stars to even entire sports teams going down the same route, but bricks and mortar are seen as safer assets for tokenization: they’re physical, they’re easy to value, and now they’re also easily divisible into shares that can be tokenized and traded.

Crypto-Property Deals Aren’t Always What They Seem

Despite real estate being successfully traded for bitcoin by a number of individuals and companies, some projects have failed to deliver on their initial promises. In September 2017, Aston Property Ventures announced it would develop a $300 million, 1,500-apartment complex in Dubai. The project, the brainchild of dubious British entrepreneurial duo Michelle Mone and Doug Barrowmen, was touted by Mone as “The first-ever development to be priced in bitcoin.”

Initial reports from the duo indicated high customer interest, with Mone announcing that 50 of the 150 properties available for bitcoin holders were already sold as of February 2018. However, despite showing all the early indications of a success story, the project, which was slated for completion in the summer of 2019, remains incomplete and was reported as ‘suspended’ by Blockonomi in April. Coming from the same businesswoman who made a royal mess of her ICO – and then raged at news.Bitcoin.com for reporting the matter, this is perhaps no surprise.

Despite the ignominy of a number of much-vaunted crypto property deals, blockchain and real estate continue to plow the same furrow. Security token platform Harbor has already tokenized $100M of real estate, with the promise of plenty more to come. What began as an experiment – exchanging bricks and mortar for bitcoin – has evolved into a burgeoning industry, with crypto at its core.

Managed by decentralized networks spread out across the entire globe, the world’s cryptocurrencies are uniquely useful and polarizing at the same time. There is no single uniform international legislation to designate how digital currency can and can’t be used, so that leaves each country to its own devices. Where some countries might embrace this financial technology as the latest and greatest economic engine for the future, there are others who want nothing to do with it. Some have even criminalized it.

Whatever reason a country gives for banning crypto, it mostly about maintaining control of its own financial system.

Saudi Arabia has banned Bitcoin for religious reasons, saying it’s incompatible with Muslim law. Iceland banned Bitcoin to protect against too much money leaving the island nation’s borders. The Bolivian government banned it on the simple rationale that it doesn’t control it.

Ecuador has been at war with popular cryptocurrencies since 2014 or so. The country’s central bank issued a damning statement against Bitcoin, saying that BTC has “no backup, because it supports its value in speculation. The financial transactions carried out through Bitcoin are not controlled, supervised, or regulated by any entity in Ecuador, which is why its use represents a financial risk for those who use it.” The Ecuadorian powers that be want people to stick to approved financial systems.

It certainly bears mentioning that Ecuador happened to issue its own national cryptocurrency in 2015 as a compliant system that’s tied to the local currency and adds convenience to everyday transactions. It would seem that the government didn’t fear new technology, they just wanted its citizens to use its own implementation of it.

Many countries that ban this technology have a history of not letting their own currency be traded on the free market. They establish exchange rates not through economics, but by simply saying, “Okay, the exchange rate is now X.” But it’s hard for people to trust a manipulated currency, so they start looking for other options. These governments feel threatened by technology that liberates money, so their only course of action is to criminalize and restrict it.

But all this does is create a black market in their country. You can’t turn Bitcoin off with laws, we’re well beyond that now.

They might say crypto is off-limits until they come up with compatible regulations.

Cryptocurrency at large has been subject to bad PR. For too many people, Bitcoin is reduced to “that internet money that people used to buy drugs and order hitmen.” For enabling so much anonymity, cryptocurrencies opened a Pandora’s box on what people were willing to transact for. Perhaps predictably, people were willing to spend money on things that were straight-up illegal.

This association — that cryptocurrency enables criminals and terrorists — has scared off a number of national governments. Countries like China, Vietnam, and Bolivia would rather see the technology banned on the pretense that they are developing laws to successfully keep crypto out of gray or black zones. The thinking is “let’s regulate it before we use it.”

But this isn’t compatible with innovation. The first TVs were invented before there was any associated regulation. They were sold on the market and people waited to see what happened as a result.

Just because crypto is legal within a certain country doesn’t mean it is without opponents.

The United States has a generally positive stance on cryptocurrency. There are a number of crypto startups and investment firms bringing legitimate business power and proof points to this still-developing branch of fintech. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve even called Bitcoin a “speculative store of value” in line with gold.

Even if it’s perfectly legal, countries can still make it inconvenient to hold crypto. The US Treasury specifically says Bitcoin is not a currency, but a money services business (MSB). This distinction means it is subject to Bank Secrecy Act, so exchanges, payment processors, and other crypto businesses have to follow strict reporting, registration, and record-keeping practices. Furthermore, the IRS calls Bitcoin a property, which means those who hold it are subject to tax.

The US furthermore has at least one outspoken congressman working to make crypto illegal on the level of Ecuador and Bolivia. Democrat Brad Sherman has notoriously called for US lawmakers to “nip this in the bud” and issue a blanket ban on all crypto purchases made by Americans. His argument is that cryptocurrency is on its way to supplanting the US dollar, and this threatens America’s stature on the world stage. But this attitude reflects clear steps backward, not forwards.

Ten years after being released, cryptocurrency technology is like an unstoppable machine that wraps around the entire world. You can’t turn it off, you can only choose how to engage with it (if at all). Common-sense regulations, everyday business applications, and changed perceptions will lead us to an environment where this category of financial technology sees more mainstream acceptance.

You can’t please everyone all the time, but this cat’s already out of the bag.

At a high level, cryptocurrencies have repeatedly proven vulnerable to theft. Although blockchains themselves have (usually) remained secure, users have lost billions of dollars. From basic password management to phishing scams, crypto is, well, dangerous. There’s nobody to save you if your bitcoin gets stolen—no insurance, no customer service. You are your own security, for better or worse.

More worrisome, though, is what would happen if a cryptocurrency, like Libra, were launched on a large scale. The storage and security challenges particular to the crypto community could affect a far greater swath of the global financial system. People who turn to Facebook’s Libra to transfer money could face challenges normally associated with bitcoin’s irreversible transactions. What happens if somebody steals someone’s password? And what if they accidentally send money to the wrong person? It could have difficult ramifications for the financial industry.

In particular, policymakers worry that Libra—which would provide users a digital token tied a basket of government-backed currencies—may lack appropriate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls. The regulatory pressure has been sufficient to scare off at least one partner, PayPal, which on Friday (Oct. 4) backed out of the Libra Association, the Switzerland-based group overseeing the cryptocurrency.

Additional members, like Visa and Mastercard, may also be reconsidering their commitments.

As the Libra Association seemingly teeters, the project has also lost its product chief, Simon Morris. He left the group in August, just two months after Libra’s public unveiling, according to The Telegraph.

With Facebook attracting ever greater scrutiny and doubt, CEO Mark Zuckerberg will soon testify about his company’s crypto aspirations. He’s expected to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23. David Marcus, who leads Calibra (Facebook’s crypto wallet), testified before the same committee in July but did little assuage lawmakers’ concerns. (Likely adding insult to injury, Marcus was the president of PayPal before joining Facebook.)

Zuckerberg’s performance will be a key moment for Libra’s future—it could determine whether the nucleus of the Libra Association remains intact, or whether it collapses under lawmakers’ pressure. It’s easy to imagine how Zuck will testify: Libra won’t launch until it’s addressed regulators’ concerns… We will take the time to get this right.

But those phrases are empty without action. Libra is losing, and fast. As it stands, the Association has pushed back the cryptocurrency’s launch date from the first half of 2020 to the second half. Onlookers, like Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple (one of the world’s largest crypto companies), have expressed skepticism about Libra ever launching. Perhaps, he’s right.

REGULATORY WATCH

There’s new tax guidance for cryptocurrencies. The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) answered long-held questions from the cryptocurrency community through a new revenue ruling on Oct. 9. The agency prescribes how taxpayers should calculate the “fair market value” of their crypto holdings, thereby clarifying how investors ought to determine their crypto-tax obligations. For most crypto investors, this information is more than sufficient. Depending on whether they purchased their crypto through an exchange, from a peer, or received it in exchange for goods or services, the US tax agency has them covered. The IRS even explains that traders can use accounting standards, like first-in-first-out (FIFO) and specific identification, to minimize tax obligations.

However, in its discussion of network splits—better known as forks—the IRS makes an egregious misstep. Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group, explains that the agency’s approach imposes an unreasonable burden on investors. Anybody can fork a public network (like bitcoin), creating new digital coins without necessarily informing the existing network’s users. But the IRS essentially says it expects investors to pay taxes on any alternate versions of bitcoin—or for that matter, alternate versions of any other cryptocurrencies they hold.

“It’s like owing income tax when someone buries a gold bar on your property and doesn’t tell you about it,” writes Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s director of research. “It’s absurd and impossible to reasonably comply.”

The agency’s FAQ on virtual currency transactions should help address the majority of crypto-tax questions. But if you’re looking for a pedantic take on the finer points of cryptocurrency taxation, look no further than Marco Santori, president and chief legal officer of Blockchain, a crypto wallet provider:

Quality is not an act, it is a habit.",,https://www.coindesk.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-ether-cryptocurrency-is-a-commodity,"CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert has said ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is a commodity.

Speaking at the Yahoo! Finance All Markets Summit Thursday, Tarbert said he believes ether is not a security.

“We’ve been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven’t said anything about ether – until now,” Tarbert said. “It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.”

Tarbert continued to say the CFTC is working with the SEC on the two cryptocurrencies and have agreed both are not securities. Going forward, the CFTC may allow ether futures to trade on U.S. markets, he suggested.

In May, a senior CFTC official told CoinDesk the agency was ready to approve an ethereum futures contract if it met the correct conditions.

Concerning currencies created by hard forks, Tarbert argued the CFTC’s treatment of each new coin should depend on its creation.

The chairman said:

“It stands to reason that similar assets should be treated similarly. If the underlying asset, the original digital asset, hasn’t been determined to be a security and is therefore a commodity, most likely the forked asset will be the same. Unless the fork itself raises some securities law issues under that classic Howey Test.”

Tarbert further addressed the Facebook-led Libra project, saying the major federal regulators are looking at the planned stablecoin and it has yet to be determined whether it falls into the security classification.

“Is it a security, first and foremost. And if it isn’t a security, it is most likely a commodity,” he said.

Later in his discussion, Tarbert announced that the CFC has appointed a new director of LabCFTC, the agency’s experimental fintech initiative.

Taking on the role is Melissa Netram, formerly director of global public policy and regulatory affairs for financial software company Intuit. Netram also comes with experience in financial services at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Service first launched in January

After suspending the service in less than two months after launch in January, Keplerk says that its customers will be able to buy Bitcoin from tobacconists in coupons of 50, 100 or 250 euros, France’s top news channel BFM TV reports Oct. 10.

According to the report, Bitcoin payments in all 5,200 locations will be feasible through Keplerk’s partner Bimedia, which will provide payment terminals.

As previously reported, Keplerk’s initial launch in January 2019 of the service reportedly involved just six tobacco shops, while other publications reported there were as many as 24 shops participating in the program. At the time, Keplerk co-founder Adil Zakhar stated that the firm was planning to expand the project to 6,500 tobacco shops by February despite the reports that France’s central bank did not endorse the initiative.

Bitcoin adoption surges in France

Meanwhile, France is apparently seeing a surge in cryptocurrency adoption. In late September, Cointelegraph reported that over 25,000 points-of-sale of 30 French retailers including sportswear giant Decathlon and cosmetics store Sephora will start accepting BTC payments by early 2020. As reported earlier in September, the French unit of Domino's Pizza launched an ordering competition with a prize of $110,000 in Bitcoin or cash.

US authorities indicted Matthew Ho, 29, with 14 counts related to his long-running scam, which allegedly involved stealing identities and credit cards to purchase services from major US-based providers Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Services.

According to a Department of Justice (DoJ) release, Ho consumed more than $5 million in unpaid cloud computing services between October 2017 and February 2018 — a time span of just a few months.

The extent of the operation allegedly made Ho one of AWS‘ largest consumers of data by volume for a short time.

This was reportedly possible due to Ho’s creation of a “web of phony email accounts,” combined with social engineering techniques, to convince cloud computing providers to defer billing and approve heightened account privileges, which granted access to more processing power and storage.

In particular, indictment docs show Ho used the monikers “Prefinity” and “Ethereum Vendor” to sell the illicitly-generated cryptocurrency via peer-to-peer marketplaces LocalBitcoins and LocalEthereum. He’s also said to have used Facebook to solicit further business.

“Whats your move?”

“Some of the bills were paid by the California game developer’s financial staff before the fraud was detected,” said the DoJ. “Ho also used the identities of a Texas resident and the founder of a tech company in India […] which he similarly used as part of his cryptocurrency mining operation.”

Ho is also alleged to have charged hundreds of thousands of dollars to his victim’s credit cards, which they paid before realizing the fraud.

If found guilty on all counts, Ho faces more than 30 years in prison. He’s now reportedly in the custody of Singaporean police, under investigation for various alleged offences committed under Singaporean law.

Combating illicit players

On Oct. 10, Alipay reiterated its anti-crypto stance in a Twitter thread, which warned that the company is closely monitoring over-the-counter transactions to identify irregular behavior and ensure compliance with relevant regulations. Alipay wrote:

“If any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, @Alipay immediately stops the relevant payment services.”

This move follows various reports that Alipay is being used for BTC transactions.

Binance uses Alipay for buying crypto

On Oct. 9, major crypto exchange Binance confirmed on Twitter that it has begun accepting fiat currencies through online payment service Alipay and mobile messaging and payment app WeChat.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, clarified that the exchange is not working directly with WeChat or Alipay, and users are still able to use them for peer-to-peer transactions.

This announcement followed the implementation of Binance’s peer-to-peer trading for Bitcoin, Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) against the Chinese yuan (CNY) earlier, as reported by Cointelegraph.

China’s CBDC plans

Originally founded in China in 2017, Binance made its first strategic investment in Beijing-based crypto and blockchain publication Mars Finance in mid-September. At the time, the crypto community was anticipating the People’s Bank of China to launch its own central bank digital currency (CBDC).

However, in late September, the bank shattered these expectations — claiming that it has no specific launch date for its CBDC and denying that the country is ready to roll out the new financial asset.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/a-united-nations-agency-has-launched-a-crypto-fund/,"The adoption and widespread use by the mainstream public are vital for crypto and Bitcoin to eventually reach its full potential. Acceptance from global government entities is nearly as important, as they wield the power to prevent the asset class from developing further.

However, a recent nod of support has arrived from the United Nations, with one agency under the multinational body launching its very own cryptocurrency fund.

UNICEF Becomes First UN Organization To Launch Crypto Fund

The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) has revealed that is has become the first United Nations organization to both hold crypto and conduct transactions in the digital asset class.

Their mission is to provide emergency food, medical supplies, and even education to children who are unable to fend for themselves due to economic conditions, war, and other atrocities.

Appropriately dubbed the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund, it allows the UN agency to “receive, hold, and disburse donations” of Ethereum and Bitcoin. The firm says that they will use crypto to fund a variety of open source technologies that will benefit kids in need across the globe.

Any cryptocurrencies donated to the fund will be held in the same crypto that was contributed and will be granted out in that same cryptocurrency. The first contribution was made by The Ethereum Foundation, and the grant will benefit three grantees from the UNICEF Innovation Fund – Prescrypto, Atix Labs, and Utopixar – as well as a “project coordinated by the GIGA initiative to connect schools across the world to the internet.”

UNICEF says that the launch is part of “ongoing work with blockchain technology,” and that the agency is part of the UN Innovation Network – responsible for “researching the potential and pitfalls of blockchain and other emerging technologies.”

Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation said that the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund would “improve access to basic needs, rights, and resources” and that crypto as a technology would “better countless lives and industries in the years to come.”

Now CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert, who just took over the role in July, has come to a decision on its status. Tarbert believes ether (ETH) is a commodity, and thus falls under the jurisdiction of the CFTC. He also anticipates ether futures trading on U.S. markets in the near future.

“We've been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity. We haven't said anything about ether—until now,” Tarbert said on stage at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit in New York City on Thursday. “It is my view as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity.”

Tarbert agrees with the SEC’s previous guidance that bitcoin and ether are not securities. And he says the CFTC is working with the SEC on these issues.

The CFTC first stated that it views “bitcoin and other virtual currencies” as commodities back in 2015 (long before the SEC did), buried in a filing when it brought charges against a company called Coinflip. But this is the first time the CFTC has given guidance on ether.

Tarbert acknowledges “ambiguity in the market” on the status of many coins, but says that ultimately “similar digital assets should be treated similarly.”

[Read more: What is Ethereum, what is ether?]

Perhaps most interestingly, Tarbert says that “forked” assets—cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) or bitcoin gold (BTG), coins created via forks from the original underlying blockchain—should be treated by regulators the same as the original asset. In other words, the CFTC’s classification of each coin depends on how the coin was created.

“It stands to reason that similarly assets should be treated similarly. If the underlying asset, the original digital asset, hasn’t been determined to be a security and is therefore a commodity, most likely the forked asset will be the same,” Tarbert said, “unless the fork itself raises some securities law issues under that classic Howey Test.”

Story continues

The “Howey Test” refers to a 1946 case involving the selling of shares in a citrus grove that the SEC now uses as its north star in determining whether a digital currency behaves like a security. SEC director of corporate finance Bill Hinman, speaking at Yahoo Finance’s All Markets Summit: Crypto in San Francisco in June of last year, explained that newly created tokens are likely securities because they are marketed with “the promise that the assets will be cultivated in a way that will cause them to grow in value, to be sold later at a profit,” and “typically are sold to a wide audience rather than to persons who are likely to use them on the network.”

Bitcoin and ether, on the other hand, Hinman and the SEC see as sufficiently decentralized and not controlled by a third party “whose efforts are a key determining factor in the enterprise.” Thus Hinman determined that sales of bitcoin and ether are not securities transactions.

CFTC Chairman Tarbert was asked on stage by Yahoo Finance’s Scott Gamm whether the Howey Test is really relevant anymore in 2019. He says it is: ""I think the analysis is pretty sound. It has stood the test of time. Ultimately it goes to the fundamental question: is this something that is being used for capital raising, and are you investing in an enterprise, or are you buying something that has tangible store of value in and of itself?”

Tarbert also gave insight on how he and the CFTC view coins created through initial coin offerings (ICOs). He believes it is possible for a new coin to start out as a security but eventually become a commodity. “You can have a situation where something in an initial coin offering is a security initially, but over time, it gets more decentralized, and there's a tangible value there, so you can have things that change back and forth.”

Tarbert’s comments come one day after the IRS issued its first new crypto tax guidance in five years, specifying that cryptocurrencies created from a fork should be handled as “ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the new cryptocurrency when it is received,” which matches what it has said about bitcoin.

In other words, it would appear that multiple government agencies are thinking about forked cryptocurrencies right now.

Earlier this week, Tarbert’s CFTC predecessor Christopher Giancarlo said in an interview with crypto site The Block that he expects crypto policy will “get serious” this year. “2019 is the year in which there's a growing recognition that regulators and policy makers need to do more than just be aware of these, but may actually need to look at some policy responses,” Giancarlo said. “And I think the thing driving that in 2019 is a combination of Libra and the prospects for central bank digital currencies.”

Indeed, the coin community is watching closely the developments in Facebook’s attempt to launch cryptocurrency Libra, which has faced backlash from lawmakers. Last week, PayPal, one of 28 “founding members” of the Libra Association, dropped out.

After Hinman of the SEC issued his opinion on ether last year at the Yahoo Finance summit, cryptocurrency bulls breathed a collective sigh of relief; the price of ether surged. Tarbert’s clarity on ether and on forked assets could cause crypto prices to pop for a short time, if the past is any indication.

IRS wants to know about your crypto in 2019

On Oct. 11, a draft of the “Additional Income and Adjustments to Income” section of the new 1040 form surfaced that included a change was made to the ‘Additional Income and Adjustments to Income’ section. On the new 1040 form, the additional question reads:

“At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

The question expects a straightforward yes or no, with no additional details requested.

Cointelegraph previously reported that the IRS had issued new guidelines for tax reporting on cryptocurrency airdrops and hard forks. The tax agency’s guidance answered questions about cryptocurrency transmissions for investors that hold cryptocurrencies as a capital asset and set general principles of tax law to determine that virtual currency is property for federal tax purposes.

An ETF is supposed to throw open the floodgates of retail investment into the cryptocurrency by allowing investors to profit from its price volatility by tracking it, instead of owning it directly.

But that narrative will have to wait.

The SEC on Wednesday rejected another Bitcoin ETF proposal, quashing hopes for the debut of an ETF linked to the cryptocurrency this year. But Bitwise, the San Francisco-based firm behind the proposal, is taking its lumps in stride.

“We look forward to continuing to productively engage with the SEC to resolve their remaining concerns, and intend to re-file as soon as appropriate,” stated Matthew Hougan, Director of Research at Bitwise, after the decision.

Bitwise Asset Management had one of the strongest Bitcoin ETF proposals to date. It constructed an elaborate case, arguing that the 10 cryptocurrency exchanges it intended to track for Bitcoin price constituted the “real” Bitcoin market. But the federal agency is not convinced and has sent Bitwise back to the drawing board.

The rest of the crypto industry and Bitcoin prices seem to be taking their cue from Bitwise.

Bitcoin price, which had earlier displayed volatile reactionary displacements to SEC orders, stayed on course. Instead the action shifted to futures platforms as Bakkt, the recently-launched Bitcoin futures platform by NYSE owner ICE, showed a sharp increase in trading volume immediately after the announcement. However, Bakkt volumes returned to their previous lows on Thursday morning.

Optimism despite rejection

Despite the rejection, industry experts were sanguine about future approval prospects for an ETF and its impact on the crypto ecosystem.

Nick Cowan, managing director and founder of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange Group, said the rejection was a stumbling block and not a setback. “We can take comfort in parallels with previously emerging industries; such as the gaming sector, where regulation had to play catch up with innovation,” he said, adding that this was still the “early phases” of digital assets becoming widely accepted among investors, institutional and retail.

“I think an ETF will ultimately come,” said Ryan Alfred, President at Digital Assets Data – a Fintech company focused on cryptoassets.

In his telling, the spike in volumes at Bakkt could be a harbinger for creation of a significant market and, subsequently, price discovery for Bitcoin within the United States. Most traders believe that price discovery for Bitcoin occurs at exchanges located abroad, such as Hong Kong-based BitMEX and Malta-based Binance, because they have relatively developed crypto markets.

“What I think the SEC would love to see is price discovery happening at Bakkt and that would likely give them comfort to allow an ETF to launch,” said Alfred.

Meanwhile, a “healthy mix of business models” within the crypto ecosystem will ensure that the absence of funds from an ETF does not sound a death knell for the industry, said Charles Phan—chief technology officer at Interdax—a crypto derivatives platform.

“The rejection of the Bitcoin ETF should not be a major setback for institutional uptake, provided the SEC eventually approves measures to recognize Bitcoin as a proper market,” he said.

Eventually, though, the importance of a Bitcoin ETF to the crypto ecosystem may be overstated. “There is no such thing as a single product that can make or break Bitcoin,” said Mati Greenspan, senior analyst with eToro, a trading platform for cryptocurrencies.

“The more financial products there are, the more helpful it is for Bitcoin. Regardless of the products, however, Bitcoin will continue to go forward and grow.”",2019-10-11 21:35:34,https://www.coindesk.com/draper-backed-startup-launches-crypto-domains-on-ethereum,"A startup building domains on blockchains has just launched a .crypto name registry on ethereum.

Unstoppable Domains – a firm backed in May to the tune of $4 million by Draper Associates and Boost VC – said Friday that the new .crypto extension can be connected to users’ public cryptocurrency address, allowing third-parties to more easily send funds.

Doing away with long, complex crypto address (for example, a bitcoin address will look something like “1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2”) in favor of a more memorable and less mistake-prone domain will “simplify cryptocurrency payments and lead to mainstream adoption,” Unstoppable Domains claimed.

The firms indicated it’s already seen a high level of interest in its first domain extension, .zil, with over 100,000 having been sold.

The original service was built on the Zilliqa blockchain (hence the .zil domain) and the website content was stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) or other decentralized storage networks, the company said at the time.

While the new registry is built on ethereum, it isn’t restricted to payments in ether.

Co-founder and CEO Matthew Gould commented:

“We believe that tribalism in the crypto community is slowing down adoption of the technology. .Crypto is a domain name system meant to be used for any cryptocurrency payment and with any cryptocurrency wallet. Sending money to a .crypto domain is a way simpler user experience for the millions of cryptocurrency users that currently have to copy/paste and type in long addresses in order to transact.”

The firm’s blockchain domains can also be used to provide “uncensorable” websites, it says on its website. Linking the domain to content on a decentralized storage network results in pages that “no one” can take down.

Using an immutable blockchain for web domains can have its downside, however.

As reported last week, a hacker exploited a bug in an auction run by OpenSea for the Ethereum Naming Service (ENS) resulting in a number of top level names – including apple.eth, defi.eth, wallet.eth, and pay.eth. – being nabbed with no way to retrieve them.

After OpenSea appealed to the hacker and offered a reward, the domains were handed back.

Buy Bitcoin at Tabacs

French fintech startup Keplerk announced Thursday that it has resumed service selling BTC at “Tabacs” in and around Paris, after halting the service earlier this year. A Tabac is a convenience store licensed to sell tobacco products. These stores also sell newspapers, lotto tickets, scratch games, telephone cards and postage stamps. Keplerk wrote:

You can go to one of the 5,200 tobacco shops today and easily buy your €50 €100 or €250 vouchers.

All 5,200 stores are equipped with a payment terminal from Keplerk’s partner, Bimedia, a payment solution provider for Tabacs. According to local media, Keplerk will focus on selling only BTC for the time being, and will not be offering ETH as previously planned.

The Original Launch and Regulatory Warnings

Keplerk first announced in November last year that it would sell bitcoin at Tabacs. The firm then started selling BTC vouchers at a handful of tobacco stores in January. At the time, cofounder Adil Zakhar said he wanted to enroll up to 6,500 Tabacs by February. However, instead, the firm halted the service on Feb. 27. Its official reason for suspending the service was that the system was too slow. The startup planned to relaunch the service in April, but it was delayed until this month.

With dwindling tobacco sales, France’s 24,000 licensed tobacco shops have diversified into products such as prepaid credit cards, cellphone credits and money transfer services, Reuters explained. “Some people find it complicated to get bitcoins on-line,” Zakhar was quoted by the news outlet as saying. “They trust their local tobacco shop owner more than they would trust some remote anonymous website.”

Following the firm’s original announcement, three French regulators — The Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), the Banque de France and the Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR) — issued statements warning the public of the risks associated with investing in speculative digital assets. Local media reported that the authorities also alerted consumers not to confuse Keplerk with other regulated entities in France such as Kepler Cheuvreux and Kepler Capital Markets which have no connection to the fintech company selling BTC.

In its March public warning, the AMF explained: “Cryptocurrencies are booming and many platforms on the internet offer to invest in these very special assets. But this type of investment has many risks: volatility, scams, etc. All you need to know before you decide.”

Keplerk is not the only firm in France offering such a service. Digycode has been selling BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, and DASH vouchers at thousands of Tabacs and service stations in €20, €50, and €200 denominations.

Following the release earlier this week of the IRS’s long-awaited guidance for reporting crypto-related income, the IRS on Friday circulated a draft of the new Form 1040, Schedule 1, Additional Income and Adjustments to Income. The draft was shared in an email to tax software companies, which the agency also shared with journalists.

The sheet, prefaced by a warning that it’s only a draft and not an actual document for filing taxes, asks at the top:

“At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?”

The main parts of the form, “Additional Income” and “Adjustments to Income,” both appear below this question.

“Taxpayers who file Schedule 1 to report income or adjustments to income that can’t be entered directly on Form 1040 should check the appropriate box to answer the virtual currency question. Taxpayers do not need to file Schedule 1 if their answer to this question is NO and they do not have to file Schedule 1 for any other purpose,” the IRS said.

The IRS asked its software partners to send comments on the new form in the next 30 days.

The guidance released this week was the agency’s second-ever given on virtual currencies, following five years of silence on the matter. The document provided answers to long-standing questions, addressing such issues as crypto received as a result of a hard fork, buying goods and services with virtual currencies, calculating the fair value of crypto holdings and other matters.

Hoskinson made his remarks during an interview for the Off the Chain podcast on Oct. 10, hosted by Morgan Creek Digital Assets co-founder Anthony Pompliano.

After multiple projects that included co-founding Ethereum, Hoskinson — a mathematician, cryptographer and entrepreneur — founded the peer-to-peer technology firm Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) in 2015.

As CEO of IOHK, Hoskinson created and launched the cryptocurrency Cardano in 2017, which uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm dubbed Ouroboros.

Bitcoin: “blind, deaf and dumb by design”

During the interview, Hoskinson reflected on Bitcoin's origins, the parameters they set for subsequent projects, so-dubbed Bitcoin maximalism, and how Bitcoin’s future survival is intimately bound up with the fate of the entire industry.

“One of the biggest problems with Bitcoin,” he began, “is that it’s blind, deaf and dumb and that was by design.”

This was appropriate for its earliest ambitions, he said, proposing that the two core features of the Bitcoin experiment were “will Proof-of-Work evolve into a decentralized system and will the token achieve value?”

Conversely, Bitcoin was never intended “to replicate the world financial system and also be fully compliant with that system, this was not in its scope.”

Hoskinson critiqued Bitcoin Maximalists for taking Satoshi’s vision as “the gospel” and dismissing any deviation from it as wrong:

“I can’t even make pull payments with Bitcoin and that’s [...] the bread and butter of most of our commercial systems.”

Maximalists should concede that Bitcoin’s not necessarily always fit-for-purpose, he said. And having to go off-chain to solve certain limitations isn’t the solution either:

“You don’t solve your decentralized reality, your decentralized dream, by centralizing it. That’s philosophically incompatible.”

“Bitcoin, frankly, is the brand of cryptocurrencies”

Hoskinson's comments on Bitcoin’s importance for the entire cryptocurrency space spun out of a discussion of the merits of Proof-of-Work (PoW) vs. Proof-of-Stake systems, and which of the two is more likely to survive.

He made the case that PoW systems will only survive if they find a way to evolve in such a way that the work — computation — becomes useful, i.e. by monetizing excess computational capacity in order to establish a “marketplace for distributed computation.”

Currently, he argued, those who are evangelical about the need to preserve an absolutely trustless protocol ignore the fact that PoW systems always federate in reality, being determined by who has access to subsidized power, data centers and specialized ASIC miners.

Notwithstanding his vision of how the PoW space needs to evolve in order to overcome these shortcomings, he concluded with the robust acknowledgment that:

“Bitcoin frankly is the brand of cryptocurrencies. We can’t say, oh, I’m going to succeed but Bitcoin’ll fail. if Bitcoin fails, the whole industry’s probably in for a really bad time.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, Hoskinson had announced the roll-out of Cardano version 1.6 this August.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/swedish-government-auctions-cryptocurrency-again/,"Swedish Government Auctions Cryptocurrency Again

The Swedish Enforcement Authority, Kronofogden, is once again auctioning off cryptocurrency that has been allotted for public sale. The online auction, which is the second of this kind the government agency conducts, starts on Friday, October 11.

BTC Worth $37,000 Offered to the Public

The office of Sweden’s bailiff, the government debt collecting organization, offers potential buyers to acquire 4.59 BTC valued at around 370,000 Swedish krona, or approximately $37,700, according to the current exchange rate. That’s close to $8,200 per coin, while BTC is trading on cryptocurrency markets just below the $8,400 mark at the time of writing.

Kronofogden first auctioned bitcoins it had in its custody about two years ago, when the highest bid was placed at 43,000 Swedish krona. That was way above the market value of the cryptocurrency, which was then 27,600 krona, the Swedish outlet Di reminds. The sale was met with great interest.

“Many people ask why we auction the cryptocurrency and we don’t exchange it ourselves. The answer is that there is no infrastructure that meets our requirements,” explained Johannes Paulson, a representative of the Swedish Enforcement Authority. “We have to do it in a quality-assured way to know the money isn’t going to be lost,” he elaborated as quoted in a press release.

There is a choice of platforms allowing users to purchase cryptocurrencies in a safe and secure way. But auctions conducted by government institutions also provide buyers with undeniable proof of the funds’ origin. In the absence of comprehensive regulations in many jurisdictions, buying crypto from the state is a safe option as the legality of the transaction cannot be questioned by the authorities.

Crypto Seized From Debtors

Sweden’s Kronofogden, or Kronofogdemyndigheten as is its full name, is responsible for debt collection, distraint, and evictions in the Nordic country. It is the only government agency authorized to withdraw money from debtors’ bank accounts and seize property. “As more people use bitcoin, the likelihood a debtor can also own the currency increases,” the announcement notes.

“Property can be found not only on driveways and in living rooms, but also on the internet. Nowadays, we are looking for assets in computers and hard drives as well as in phones and web services,” Johannes Paulson explains. He emphasized that the foreclosure this time was conducted in close cooperation with the Swedish police. The fiat money from the auction will go to pay off the owner’s debts.

Although Kronofogden encounters cryptocurrencies more and more often, the Crown Bailiff Authority admits it faces difficulties trying to get into encrypted wallets that store the digital coins. In order to achieve that, it relies on joint efforts with the Police Authority of Sweden and the Swedish Tax Agency, the official added.

When Kronofogden suspects that a debtor owns crypto, it works actively to find, evaluate and then sell the digital holdings to compensate the creditor. If the sale generates more than the amount of the debt, the surplus goes back to the debtor. Kronofogden is obliged to aim for the highest possible price for the assets it sells.

Monitoring BCH Network Statistics and Market Indicators

In the early days, it was much harder to find reliable data platforms in order to observe market action and network metrics. Today, however, there are numerous digital currency data sites including great number of web portals that comb the BCH network and monitor price action. The following is a list of Bitcoin Cash-centric data websites that give people identifiers, information, and statistics on nearly everything within the BCH ecosystem.

Coin Dance

Cash.coin.dance is a BCH network data website with a large number of different metrics collected. The site has been around for quite some time and provides free information on network statistics tied to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Coin Dance has information on node count, blocks, development, and politics and opinion data as well. For instance, the blocks section gives up-to-the-minute mining and BCH block statistics like hashrate distribution, block sizes, profitability against BTC mining, network fees, hashrate, and records of block details.

In the nodes section, Coin Dance breaks down all the BCH clients into statistical data and charts. The Bitcoin Cash platform and protocol development page shows all the completed code, proposals under discussion, and projects in the works. Coin Dance covers quite a bit of BCH network information and has been a go-to data site for many BCH proponents.

Bitcoin.com Charts

Charts.Bitcoin.com is a web portal filled with a ton of calculations and tallies that provide an insight into the BCH ecosystem as a whole. Bitcoin.com’s charts show visitors the BCH price, market cap, money supply, daily transactions, hashrate, inflation rate, block size, and network fees. Charts.Bitcoin.com also covers other statistical information like Metcalfe’s Law, the Velocity of Money, transaction size, output volume, UTXO set size, and UTXO growth. The charts are downloadable, embeddable, and press-ready so people can use Bitcoin.com’s charts for network or market data in articles or academic papers.

Blockonomics

Another website called blockonomics.co shows people transaction and invoice information. Simply paste an address or a transaction ID in the website’s window and Blockonomics will show all the data tied to that specific transaction or address. Blockonomics also allows people to monitor and create watch-only BCH wallets. This means users can get notified any time a wallet action takes place like sending and receiving BCH. The web portal also offers an invoice generator so users can create a BCH invoice in a matter of minutes.

Simpleledger.info

Simpleledger.info is a Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) transaction explorer which means users can obtain statistics on SLP tokens created and used on the BCH chain. The website is built on top of SLPDB and allows individuals to search by transaction ID, address or use a token name. Simpleledger.info also tracks the latest transactions, the most popular tokens, and token creation and burns. Since SLP tokens have become popular, the Simpleledger.info explorer has become very useful for finding important information about SLP tokens and transactions.

Blockchair

Blockchair is a blockchain search and analytics engine that allows you to compare statistical information on coins like BCH, BTC, ETH, LTC, BSV, DASH, and XRP. Users can get information about the crypto’s price, network difficulty, and transactions per second while also being able to look at them simultaneously for comparisons. For instance, you can compare the difficulty of one blockchain in contrast to the BCH network difficulty. Blockchair is also a powerful blockchain explorer that has a vast amount of data on nodes and transaction broadcasts for a total of nine blockchains.

Johoe’s Bitcoin Mempool Statistics

The website jochen-hoenicke.de is a data site that shows the number and aggregate size of transactions waiting to be confirmed. The portal created by software engineer Jochen Hoenicke combs five different blockchains: BTC, BCH, DASH, LTC, and BSV. The site gives a colorful, visual representation of unconfirmed transaction count, pending transaction fees, mempool size, fees per byte. Users can filter and sort content using a variety of different criteria on each blockchain.

Studying, Researching, and Predicting Bitcoin Cash Network and Market Movements

The aforementioned sites are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to web portals that provide the ability to monitor BCH statistics and network data. As the crypto industry grows more robust, tools like these are needed to observe and chart the BCH protocol’s daily activities as well as give an insight into the cryptocurrency’s future behavior. BCH monitoring sites are wonderful tools that provide a deep view of the network and market action. Every data point can be useful to individuals and organizations studying, researching, and predicting specific elements tied to this innovative technology.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has unveiled a new draft tax form used by some 150 million people in the country to file tax returns. It has a section that requires them to answer whether they have received, sold, sent, exchanged, or acquired any financial interest in any cryptocurrencies during the year.

Also read: IRS Issues New Crypto Tax Guidance – Experts Weigh In

New Tax Form

The IRS published a draft of the new 1040 tax form containing a question about the tax filer’s crypto-related activities on Friday. The move follows the release of the agency’s long-awaited tax guidance which was published on Wednesday.

The 1040 form is the main tax form used by all filers in the U.S. According to the IRS, over 154 million tax returns were submitted using this form in 2018, and over 152 million in 2017. The new 1040 form, when implemented, will be used to file taxes starting in 2019. The IRS emphasized that “This is an early release draft of an IRS tax form, instructions, or publication, which the IRS is providing for your information,” adding:

We generally do not release draft forms until we believe we have incorporated all changes, but sometimes unexpected issues arise, or legislation is passed.

The tax agency added that any comments regarding the draft, instructions or publications can be submitted, but “we may not be able to consider many suggestions until the subsequent revision of the product,” the IRS wrote.

All US Taxpayers Will Be Asked

According to the draft of the new 1040 tax form, Schedule 1 will now include a question about the tax filer’s crypto activities. Schedule 1, entitled Additional Income and Adjustments to Income, is filed alongside the 1040 form. It is used to report income or adjustments to income that cannot be entered directly on Form 1040.

The first question on the new Schedule 1, according to the draft, will be a yes or no question which reads:

At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?

The 1040 instructions, also published Friday, has a section on “virtual currency.” The IRS explained that taxpayers must check the “yes” box if they have “engaged in any transaction involving virtual currency.”

According to the tax agency, such a transaction includes “The receipt or transfer of virtual currency for free (without providing any consideration), including from an airdrop or following a hard fork; an exchange of virtual currency for goods or services; a sale of virtual currency; and an exchange of virtual currency for other property, including for another virtual currency.”

Furthermore, the IRS reiterated that taxpayers must use Form 8949 to figure out their capital gain or loss, and report it on Schedule D of Form 1040, if they have “disposed of any virtual currency that was held as a capital asset” during the year.

For taxpayers who received any cryptocurrency “as compensation for services” or disposed of any coins held for sale to customers in a trade or business, the IRS emphasized that they must report the income as they would other income of the same type. “For example, W-2 wages on Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 1, or inventory or services from Schedule C on Schedule1,” the IRS exemplified.

Lastly, taxpayers who did not engage in any crypto transactions during the year do not need to do anything if they are not filing Schedule 1. Otherwise, they only need to check the “no” box on the form.

Government regulators across various jurisdictions continue to exert greater regulatory pressure on their local cryptocurrency industries.

Even inter-governmental agencies like the Financial Action Task Force have in recent times put crypto governance at the forefront of their regulatory ambit. For digital currency stakeholders, many of these regulatory measures can negatively impact innovation in the industry. Some even warn that harsher laws will see both capital flight and a brain drain from nations that adopt these stringent measures.

However, there is an argument to be made against the effectiveness of the approach adopted by some of the existing SROs. Some critics posit that their recommendations do not come with the appropriate authoritative weight to trigger lasting changes in the crypto regulatory landscape. Furthermore, without the participation of government regulators, it might appear that self-policing measures only amount to an elaborate exercise of “guessing legality.”

Crypto self-regulation in South Korea and Japan

Before the “crypto frenzy” of the late 2017, China was the only major market to have issued any definitive ruling in the form of a ban on digital currency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs). In the aftermath of the meteoric rise in crypto prices and the subsequent increase in global consciousness, the start of 2018 begun to see more serious government consideration of the market.

In early 2018, reports began to emerge of plans in South Korea and Japan to create self-regulating bodies for their crypto markets as a way of preempting stringent laws from the government. Thus, Japan and South Korea became some of the first jurisdictions to have some sort of crypto SRO such as the Japanese Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), which formed in April 2018.

The JVCEA emerged mostly as a reaction to the January 2018 Coincheck hack that saw the theft of more than $530 million in NEM (XEM) tokens. The association focuses on the Japanese crypto trading arena, working together with the country’s Financial Services Agency to enforce strict compliance among its members. Thus far, the JVCEA has worked to enforce regulations for hot wallet use and limits for crypto margin trading. The association became a recognized SRO in October 2018.

As early as February 2018, Cointelegraph reported that the Korean Blockchain Association (KBA) was already considering the creation of a self-regulatory framework for local exchange platforms. At the time, regulators in the country had already started taking stringent measures against crypto exchanges.

By April 2018, the KBA had finalized rules for the self-regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges. The rules focused on Anti-Money Laundering and Know Your Customer compliance.

The KBA framework also mandated that its members manage client funds separately from their own while maintaining minimum equity of $1.8 million. Exchanges under the KBA also have to publish regular audits and financial statements.

SROs in the U.K. and U.S.

Crypto stakeholders in the United Kingdom also joined Asian countries in pioneering self-regulation for the industry in early 2018. Formed in February 2018, CryptoUK is the first-ever self-regulating trade body for cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase, CEX.IO, eToro and other major crypto businesses came together to form the association. With the U.K. having no cryptocurrency regulations, CryptoUK has sought to lobby members of Parliament to create favorable laws for the local crypto industry.

In the United States, crypto exchange and custody giants like Coinbase, Bittrex and Kraken established the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) in the end of September 2019. The CRC is an independent body that provides insight on whether crypto tokens can be classified as securities or not.

In its maiden crypto ratings, the CRC examined 20 different cryptocurrencies. For example, the council classified the likes of Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Monero (XMR) as not securities.

Related: Crypto Rating Council Is Out to Help Change US Regulatory Landscape

Again, the CRC is another example of a country-based SRO focusing on a major pain point of its local crypto scene. In the U.S., exchanges have to carefully navigate unclear regulations about which crypto tokens constitute securities.

Given that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has consistently maintained that most ICO tokens are securities, some U.S. platforms have been forced to geofence certain tokens or create separate local exchanges that list only tokens deemed not to be securities.

Before the CRC, U.S. crypto exchange platform Gemini proposed the formation of an SRO for digital commodities. According to a Gemini published post from March 2018, the Virtual Commodity Association (VCA) would only focus on nonsecurity crypto tokens. As previously reported by Cointelegraph, three other platforms — Bittrex, Bitstamp, and bitFlyer USA — joined Gemini in establishing the VCA.

In the past, several commentators have called on the crypto industry to pursue self-regulation. Even members of regulatory agencies like “crypto mom” Hester Peirce of the SEC and Brian Quintenz of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have stated in the past that crypto businesses should develop modalities for self-regulation.

Back in mid-2018, Cointelegraph published a survey by Foley & Lardner LLP — an international law firm showing 86% of crypto executives being in favor of formalized self-regulation for the industry. Commenting on the need for robust self-regulation for the crypto industry, Iqbal V. Gandham, chair of CryptoUK and CEO of trading and brokerage firm eToro, wrote to Cointelegraph in an email, saying:

“Effective self-regulation combined with necessary industry-informed government regulation to promote confidence is the key to realizing the potential of the industry whilst providing the necessary protection for consumers and businesses. The cryptoasset industry is still relatively new, with advances in technology and industry collaboration already creating solutions for many of the initial concerns surrounding the asset-class, such as protection of consumer assets through cold storage.”

Over-regulation: A threat to digital innovation?

Self-regulation is not unique to the crypto space. In fact, there is an argument to be made that these SROs are trying to become the crypto analogs of organizations like the National Futures Association (NFA) — with the ability to promulgate important rules and guidelines ratified by government regulators.

In the U.S., for example, the CRC is trying to develop a nuanced approach to determining which tokens should be considered securities, as several stakeholders in the U.S. crypto space have bemoaned the current regulatory climate in the country.

In an email to Cointelegraph, Yusuf Hussain, head of risk at Gemini, explained that self-regulation could help to temper some of the more stringent crypto laws being enacted by several governments. According to Hussain, “thoughtful regulation in cryptocurrency is a win-win for the market and regulators alike. Done right, it can pave the way to healthy and sustainable markets and fuel long-term innovation that unlocks the promise of cryptocurrency and transforms society for the better.” Hussain went on to add:

“The crypto industry and regulators are trying to solve for regulatory uncertainty, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking a conservative approach while trying to define what is and is not a security. The SEC is looking to the industry to help come up with a sensible approach in conjunction with them, and a self regulatory organization (SRO).”

Back in July 2019, Ripple signed an open letter to the U.S. Congress, asking for fair crypto regulations. In the statement, the blockchain startup urged agencies not to enact laws that put U.S. cryptocurrency businesses at a disadvantage to their overseas counterparts.

Goldman Sachs-backed Circle also echoed similar sentiments earlier in the year, claiming that U.S. regulations were constituting a hindrance to digital innovation. The company has since moved the bulk of its crypto exchange business — i.e., the Poloniex platform — abroad.

In late September 2019, reports emerged that the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was looking to ban crypto derivatives. When asked for its response on the matter, CryptoUK told Cointelegraph:

“A ban would potentially expose retail customers to poorly regulated investment products in other jurisdictions, which could lead to fewer avenues for recourse and less protection for consumers. We believe retail customers interested in derivatives are best served by a well-regulated UK market overseen by the FCA and ESMA, who can utilise less restrictive measures, such as leverage limits, to achieve their aims.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, crypto exchange OKEx is looking to create a self-regulating body for cryptocurrency trading platforms. Commenting on the potential role of SROs in the face of increasing government scrutiny, Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx, wrote to Cointelegraph, stating:

“Working parallel internally and externally would strike a balance to shape a better industry.”

Government agencies in some countries appear to be exerting ever-greater regulatory pressure on their local crypto industries. Small- and medium-sized exchange platforms are coming under increasing pressure in trying to comply with tough banking laws.

Such is the extent of the problem that about 97% of these platforms are close to going bankrupt. South Korean blockchain startups are electing to list their tokens on overseas exchanges, further causing the local token trading market to shrink.

Establishing a global crypto self-regulating body

Thus far, most of the efforts at crypto self-regulation appear contained in servicing local markets. However, OKEx is looking to form a global SRO that will work toward standardizing the industry at a macro level.

Related: South Korea Is Hoping for Regulatory Clarity as Crypto Laws Toughen

As a global SRO for crypto exchanges, such an organization may function like the World Federation of Exchanges in lobbying regulators across different countries to come up with more favorable laws.

Commenting on the need for a global governance standard for the crypto industry, Cheung wrote to Cointelegraph, stating that an SRO is the only way for “exchanges to grow and deliver impact is by joining together to develop practices and policies that will set a global standard and adapt to regional regulatory frameworks.” For Cheung, rather than focus on any one local jurisdiction, the exchange’s planned SRO will have a more worldwide focus. Explaining further on the subject, Cheung said:

“This SRO will be an independent, membership-based organization that is neutral and open to exchanges of all sizes and jurisdictions. Member exchanges will work together to define and adopt standards that will promote digital asset adoption globally, educate governments and regulators, and develop metrics and criteria for trading, listings, and reporting.”

CryptoUK also expressed willingness to join a crypto SRO with a global focus but maintained that the U.K. market remains its primary objective. In an email to Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for the association declared:

“We are always open to partnering with a global forum that promotes international collaboration to introduce policies that strengthen the conduct of the global crypto industry. However, our priority remains UK regulation, reflecting the ongoing review of existing regulatory frameworks by the FCA, along with consultations on the development of new crypto-focused policy by HM Treasury.”

Gemini’s Hussain also touched on the possible emergence of a unified SRO for the global crypto market, stating, “Currently, there is no precedent for a global SRO. However, many VCA members are part of SRO initiatives in other jurisdictions, which can provide a unified, consistent approach to self regulation across multiple jurisdictions.”

However, there are critics who argue against the measures being adopted by these SROs, describing their methods as not amounting to effective self-policing. Some of the arguments against the current operations of SROs hinge on the absence of consonance between these organizations and government regulators, which have the final say on what constitutes a legal framework for cryptocurrencies.

For Hussain, self-regulation cannot exist in a vacuum, adding that in the U.S., self-regulatory organizations will always be accountable to federal regulators:

“There are specific requirements of an SRO in the United States set forth by existing regulations that require oversight by a regulatory authority.”

The Gemini executive further stated that SROs in the U.S. financial market, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the NFA, are accountable to the SEC and CFTC respectively. Until SROs and government agencies can agree on a suitable middle ground, crypto business will have to endure the patchwork of usually stringent regulations in different countries.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/ukraine-in-a-rush-to-legalize-cryptocurrencies-under-zelensky/,"Ukraine in a Rush to Legalize Cryptocurrencies Under Zelensky

The new administration in Kiev, headed by the young president Volodymyr Zelensky, has brought renewed interest in cryptocurrencies. Fresh energy is now being injected into efforts to legalize decentralized digital money and regulate related economic activities. New draft laws have been proposed or are under preparation to accommodate the nascent industry, from which the Ukrainian government expects increased budget revenues.

Push to Regulate the Crypto Industry Intensifies

Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation plans to legalize cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC). Тhe initiative to accomplish this comes directly from its current head, Mikhail Fedorov, local media reported recently, quoting his deputy and IT entrepreneur Alexander Bornyakov. The ministry is already working on a new bill that should be ready by the end of the year and preparing amendments to the country’s tax code.

Bornyakov pointed out that although cryptocurrencies in Ukraine are not banned per se, they currently don’t have any official status. Their legalization is necessary in part to protect businesses dealing with coins from police searches, emphasized the 37-year-old entrepreneur from Odessa. President Zelensky, a former popular comedian and TV producer, is preparing to appoint a new governor of the province this week, 36-year-old crypto millionaire Maxim Kutsiy.

The new generation of politicians that took over power in Kiev after the last presidential and parliamentary elections, inherited a country facing numerous challenges. These include a depreciating hryvnia, and an unresolved military conflict in the East. Allowing the promising crypto industry to flourish will undoubtedly translate into increased budget receipts. Bornyakov and his colleagues think it’s time for these companies to come out of the grey sector.

Plans to Legalize Mining and Create Crypto Valley

People from all corners of the Ukrainian society are now involved in the efforts to create regulatory certainty for the crypto industry. Representatives of the Ministry of Digital Transformation, Ukraine’s parliament (Verkhovna Rada), the non-government Better Regulation Delivery Office (BRDO), industry organizations, and businesses gathered recently to adopt a dedicated program to do that. The meeting was organized by a parliamentary group called “Blockchain4Ukraine” which unites lawmakers from different political factions.

The document details certain steps that the government and private sector need to take to achieve the set goal. These include legalizing mining, attracting international crypto asset exchanges to Ukraine, and developing the legal terminology needed to regulate the sector. Adopting amendments to the existing law “On Public Ledgers,” implementing FATF standards regarding money laundering as well as the integration of blockchain technologies into government registries are also part of the strategy.

The new management of the National Bank of Ukraine supported these efforts. Mikhail Vidyakin, acting director of the central bank’s Reform Strategy Department, commented on Facebook that the legislation necessary to regulate the crypto industry should be adopted in the shortest possible time, Forklog reported. He believes authorities must “find the courage” to do that within six to nine months after the approval of the new strategy and noted that Malta’s experience proves this is possible.

Another draft law, proposed by the Blockchain Ukraine association envisages the creation of a crypto valley in the Eastern European country. A number of established local companies with regional importance, such as crypto exchanges Exmo and Kuna, can form its core as they already have millions of users. But even until that happens, the popularity of cryptocurrencies in the country is likely to continue to grow. According to a survey among internet savvy Ukrainians conducted last year, 13% of the respondents admitted they owned digital coins.

Creating an exchange account, signing in and placing an order every time you want to switch cryptos is like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. It’s an incredibly inefficient way to jump between cryptos, and given that no exchange has all the coins, it necessitates creating multiple accounts, with the added verification and security risks this entails. Crypto-swapping platforms promise to do the hard work for you, plugging into exchange APIs and exchanging coins on your behalf.

Swapy

Swapy claims to offer the best exchange rate possible without the need to manually place buy/sell orders. It manages this by combining over 10 exchanges to give users more low-cap and low liquidity tokens at spot price. Currently, you can swap BTC, ETH and USDT into over 70 different tokens, from XEM and REM to BCH and DASH. All of the exchange flows to your wallet can be tracked on-screen.

What’s nifty about Swapy is that it charges a fee only on the amount users will save relative to competitor services. In other words, Swapy only gets a cut of what you save on a swap, doing away with a flat fee entirely. Holders of REM tokens can further increase their discount level by up to 90%. Account registration is necessary with Swapy, but only if you’re looking to claim the maximum available discount.

Changenow

Changenow only entered the marketplace last year, but has captured a significant share of the market already. The fact that it enables purchases to be made with credit card is a useful feature that’s unusual to see with crypto-swapping services. The platform enforces AML/KYC: if a transaction is marked as suspicious, the exchange is paused and the customer is asked to confirm their identity. Otherwise, Changenow doesn’t require any sort of registration. There’s no limit on the maximum amount that can be exchanged and more than 170 coins can be converted, from BTC and ETH to BCH, LTC and more niche altcoins. All transactions take under 15 minutes to complete, and a fee of 0.5% is incorporated into the exchange rate you pay.

Changelly

Changelly is one of the best-known platforms, delivering a fixed-rate mechanism that protects against the risk of market fluctuations when tokens are being swapped. Changelly claims the stability is assured by integrating a small reserve inside the exchange rate when the final quote is given to the user. This month, the platform launched an iOS app as well as a second version of its Android app, making it even easier for users to convert coins on the go.

Changelly was founded in 2015 and supports over 150 cryptocurrencies, taking a 0.25% fee for all swaps. You’ll need an email address to use the service though, and Changelly reserves the right to apply AML/KYC to certain users, addresses and particular transactions, which may deter privacy absolutists. Like Changenow, Changelly enables credit card purchases of crypto thanks to a partnership with Simplex.

Shapeshift

Speaking of KYC, Shapeshift caught flak when it announced that it would adopt a fully verified model, disincentivizing the same users who raised an eyebrow to Changelly’s policy. Citing pressure from regulators, the non-custodial exchange admitted that the move provoked the departure of many valuable API partners – but nonetheless, it remains a viable service for some.

Shapeshift offers a unique exchange rate for each coin that changes every 30 seconds according to market conditions, but its typical ‘miner’ fee is in the ballpark of 0.5%. Support is provided for 29 cryptocurrencies including BTC, BCH and DAI, and boasts one of the nicest interfaces on the market.

Flyp.me

“Simple, fast and private. No registration” is the strapline you see when alighting on flyp.me, and for users troubled by KYC, it’s music to the ears. With flyp.me, you can exchange over 30 cryptocurrencies instantly including BTC, DASH, LTC, and a bunch of other altcoins while retaining full privacy. You also retain at least a measure of control over the exchange rate: when you hit the ‘Flyp now’ button, the rate is locked in for the next few minutes. Flyp.me promises to leverage several trading platforms to secure the best exchange, analyzing the market depth and liquidity of the currency in question and taking a 0.5% cut while they’re at it.

Spain: The Royal Mint chooses PwC to develop blockchain projects

Cointelegraph en Español reported on Oct. 10 that the Spanish National Mint and Doorbell factory, Real Casa de la Moneda had chosen PwC to develop various initiatives and projects based on blockchain and digital identity technologies. The agency hopes these initiatives will enable access to a set of services that allow customers to choose the information and who to share it with, with absolute certainty for all parties that the information is true. Antonio Requena at PwC said:

“This 2019 is still a year of experimentation and intersectoral collaboration in the Spanish market, mainly in banking, insurance, energy and public administrations.

AtomixDEX decentralized crypto exchange network is available for testing

Charles Gonzales, CEO of Chainzilla, said that the AtomixDEX decentralized cryptocurrency exchange network is now available for download and testing. Gonzales added:",,https://www.coindesk.com/mastering-emotions-and-managing-risk-in-cryptocurrency-trading,"When it comes to trading, there are several steps you can take in order to reduce your exposure to the market extremes of price volatility.

A combination of both technical and fundamental analysis can be used to determine the true worth of a company or asset, securing a greater chance of success with a particular investment while reducing your risk along the way.

But for that, you need a plan.

Mastering your emotions

Developing a successful risk management plan is paramount in minimizing unexpected outcomes, translating into an overall reduction in your losses.

A successful risk management plan should also run parallel to your crypto trading journal records, working in conjunction to curb poor trading behavior while simultaneously justifying your fundamental expectations.

Sometimes temptation leads to poor choices and it is no more on display than a market driven by fear and greed.

By reducing harmful or negative trading habits, one can hope to increase profit without putting too much on the table.

A key component of a successful risk management plan is determining what kind of trader you are and where your skills currently lie:

“I usually break even” – When this occurs it could be a sign that your risk management is effective, however, you are also too risk averse and will fail to capitalise on anything substantial or you are barely able to cover trading fees.



“I make a small profit” – When this occurs it could be a sign that your risk management is effective, however, it is also an indication that you aren’t letting your trades run . It is usually driven by emotionally charged decisions made in haste, such as closing a position too early because of what is known as “weak hands.”

“I make a large profit” – When this occurs it is a sign that your risk management strategy is working well and that you have reached a pinnacle in risk aversion by applying trading sizes to the appropriate risk. It is usually an indication that you close positions at predetermined prices and let others run their course.



“I usually lose” – When this occurs it could be a sign that you have limited understanding of market cycles, need to further your research on the asset class you are investing in and you tend to pick illiquid projects/coins/tokens.

From these personas you can draw a rough idea on where you currently sit in terms of your trading mentality. The idea is to identify what habits are forcing you to lose out and which habits are guiding you to profit.

Try to remain stoic and reasoned, removing emotion from the psychological aspect of trading while relying solely on the information in front of you such as the price, volume, news and trend.

Don’t put all your eggs in one basket

No matter how tempting or promising a particular trade opportunity may appear it is never a good idea to place all of your worth on the line.

Generally, a spread of one particular type of asset class (as well as a generous mix of different asset classes within your portfolio) is an ample measure in reducing your exposure to larger price moves within a particular industry/market.

The volatility of the cryptocurrency market means that any trade, even a seemingly perfect trade, can collapse and result in a significant loss. Therefore, it is recommended that you start investing in 5 or more different coins.

Also remember to take advantage of an exchange’s stop-loss feature and use it to your benefit when you are away from trading manually such as times of rest or at work.

Time and again new traders fail to incorporate an adequate exit strategy, often arriving back at their computer to find their beloved basket of crypto have dropped 20 percent and a new trend has developed to the downside. This act not only reduces your risk but allows for greater control over your losses.

Finally, it can be tempting to use a buy and hold strategy where you invest in a coin and refuse to sell for an extended period of time. This passive approach is often tempting to new traders due to its simplicity and is often falsely associated with reducing one’s risk.

However, you’ll unlikely amount to any significant wins by playing it too safe, so dive in, take on the adequate risk and ensure you have a plan mapped out because trading crypto can be a fun and profitable endeavour when executed correctly.

The BCH-centric web portal Bitcoinbch.com published an in-depth report that shows the aggregate of cryptocurrency expenditure for Australian retail businesses. According to the 10-page document, BCH transactions in the country exceed BTC transactions by a wide margin and BCH is the top digital currency in Australia.

In Australia, Bitcoin Cash Is Soundly #1

This week the website Bitcoinbch.com revealed a report that covers cryptocurrency usage in Australia in regard to Australian merchants that support digital currencies for products and services. The research combs through the two payment processors and point-of-sale systems located throughout the country. Sources used in the analysis stem from the underwriting firms Travelbybit (TBB) and Hula (Hockings Underwriting Logistics App).

The multi-coin payment processor TBB started operations in 2017 and has around 195 merchants to-date. Hula was launched two months ago and the company has roughly 17 retailers utilizing the underwriting system. “This report captures and analyses the majority of all merchant cryptocurrency payments in Australia for the month of September 2019 by harvesting data from both the underwriting systems,” explains the report’s author and Bitcoinbch.com CEO Hayden Otto.

“Cryptocurrency adoption in Australia has taken some interesting turns — Today there is an obvious shift toward a mono-cryptocurrency adoption policy, where merchants have chosen to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) only rather than point-of-sale systems supporting a basket of different cryptos,” the report highlights. Otto’s study continues:

Further, a large percentage of these merchants have chosen to accept Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in a purely peer-to-peer fashion rather than by way of payment processors.

Bitcoin Cash Accounted for 92% of Australia’s Crypto-Based Retail Sales

The study of cryptocurrency retail sales in Australia for September 2019 notes that approximately $39,405 was spent across 625 separate transactions. “The vast majority of economic activity occurred on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain,” the report mentions. Bitcoinbch.com’s summary says the combination of datasets between TBB and Hula clearly shows that “BCH is by far the preferred choice for Australian users of electronic cash.” BCH sales dominated by 92.45% while Lightning Network had 3.1% and traditional onchain BTC transactions turned out to be 1.9%. Cryptocurrencies like LTC, BSV, and ETH are barely seen on the scope of data with 0.01% to 0.19% of retail sales.

Bitcoinbch.com’s analysis also points out that TBB has only enabled BCH as a minority on the company’s PoS system. Despite the policy, BCH still captures “the 3rd most spent and 2nd most transacted among their supported cryptocurrencies.” Otto recommends that TBB change its policy to be more accepting of BCH from a business perspective. Additionally, when observing the transactions processed by each service, Hula commands 76% of the $39K spent while TBB is only processing 24%. “The data confirms that Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as ‘Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash’ of a fast, reliable, secure, and efficient currency,” the report emphasizes. Bitcoinbch.com’s research further stresses:

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) alone accounted for 92.45% ($36,431) of all cryptocurrency spent and 80.3% (502 tx) of all cryptocurrency transactions in Australia.

The study concerning cryptocurrency expenditure for retail businesses shows that, at least in Australia, BCH has surpassed BTC in the retail space by a longshot. The 10-page report underscores that BCH outspent BTC by 48.93 to one and had 20x the transaction count. Otto concedes by saying that the BTC experiment seems to have run its course or at the very least has a lot to accomplish to even catch up to the number of BCH transactions spent. “Bitcoin Cash is soundly number one,” the report concludes.

Trump talks about the withdrawal of American forces from Syria, he’s turning his back on more than U.S. allies and the problem of their hardened prisoners from the so-called Islamic State. The president also turns his back on what has in many ways become a proving ground in the war on terrorism.

Syria has been an incubator for every innovation to the global jihad in the last decade: social media recruitment, lone-wolf inspiration, and, as of the last few years, the essential pillar of any terrorist group: financing.

A terrorist organization cannot exist without money, and since 9/11 draining those resources has been an indispensable component of fighting them. But what progress the world has made against terrorist financing in Syria is becoming increasingly irrelevant as ISIS, al Qaeda, and other jihadi groups are reviving once-dying fundraising machines with a previously untapped resource: crypto-currency.

When I began tracking terrorist financing rings in the late 1990s, they relied on charities and person-to-person resources like hawalas, which are systems of transferring money between different networks of families and trusted associates. As technology evolved, so too did terrorists, embracing services like Western Union, Moneygram, and PayPal. These developments brought forth slews of regulations and security protocols by governments and the companies themselves.

At the same time these new security measures mounted, a perfect storm of circumstances were shaping in Syria that would make the country the springboard for the jihadis’ embrace of crypto.

First was the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Monero, Lumens, Zcash, and of course Bitcoin, along with the increasing ease of exchanges. Second was the July 2016 dissolution of the Nusra Front, al Qaeda’s former Syrian affiliate. At the same time, major offensives against ISIS were well underway, shrinking its territory and removing ISIS from many of its oil fields and other financial resources. That put many foreign fighters out of a paycheck—and, with no family in Syria, short on ways to get money.

“ Jihadists in Syria needed to get creative. And what better starting point than a largely unregulated, under-the-radar resource: that is, crypto? ”

Worsening their situation, Syria was a virtual dead zone for money transfers. Now without income, ISIS and al Qaeda fighters’ only real way to get money from whatever families, friends, and supporters they had overseas was through hawala-style transfers made to neighboring countries like Turkey—an already risky process made even less reliable because of heavy monitoring by government agencies.

Jihadists in Syria needed to get creative. And, considering their options, what better starting point did they have than a largely unregulated, under-the-radar resource, that is, crypto?

By 2016, ISIS and al Qaeda fighters were already calling for crypto donations on social media. ISIS, like many other groups’ central commands, never outwardly fundraised for Bitcoin donations, but its operatives and fighters have done so on its behalf behind the scenes on social media and other platforms at least as early as 2015. By 2017, ISIS had long been receiving Bitcoin donations from all over the world, with numerous cases coming out of the US in places like New York and Virginia. To this day, you can find calls for Bitcoin donations across ISIS-linked chat groups on Telegram. ISIS would eventually even use Bitcoin to fund attacks, including the deadly Easter Day bombings in Sri Lanka bombings this past April.

Likewise, groups like al-Sadaqa, run by Western fighters associated with other jihadi factions in Syria, were among the first to fundraise with Bitcoin in any significantly organized sense. It fundraised for weapons with Bitcoin “so people from outside [Syria] can donate towards the jihad [securely] without getting [caught].” The money, according to the group, would “help by buying other items maybe guns.”

“ Just as noteworthy as the terrorists’ cleverness is their dogged persistence. ”

These fundraising messages were posted publicly on platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram. And they were anything but shy about where the money was going. In December 2017 al-Sadaqa launched a campaign for “ribat” (garrison position) upgrades. It released a video that following February thanking donors while showing video footage of their upgraded space:

We are your mujahideen brothers. We thank the brothers from Al Sadaqah for their help in reinforcing this guarding point, and we tell the brothers that we are in need of more donations, so we are able to stand firm against our enemy.

Such independent fundraising efforts were effectively proof-of-concept demonstrations. Donations came in, fighters got their money, and everything came together. By late 2017, groups linked to ISIS, al Qaeda, and other organizations began embracing this approach. Incite the Believers’ Operations Room, a coalition of Syrian factions including de facto al Qaeda affiliate Hurras al-Deen, solicits Bitcoin donations as part of its ongoing “Prepare Us [For Battle]” campaign, which it launched in May 2019 to supply weapons, ammunition, and other equipment for fighters in Northeastern Syria. Text at the bottom of its propaganda boldly gives a Bitcoin wallet address along with WhatsApp and Telegram contact info.

“ Members and supporters of these groups are finding ways to transfer Bitcoin into serviceable cash by integrating the technology with, ironically, old hawala methods. ”

Malhama Tactical, a group that trains fighters with Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization and the largest faction in Syria, even fundraised for drones to be used toward “artillery adjustment and reconnaissance.” This crypto buzz even reached upward to HTS itself which, in an April 2019 issue of its magazine, took on the utopian language of an avid crypto-bro in hyping Bitcoin as “The Currency of the Future Economy.”

Just as noteworthy as the terrorists’ cleverness is their dogged persistence. One HTS-linked fundraising organization called “Al-Ikhwa” has shared at least nine Bitcoin wallet addresses, generating at least $1,600 in Bitcoin donations among them, based on publicly available transaction records and Bitcoin values calculated based on the date of the exchanges. The update shows a mirroring approach to jihadists tactics against social media companies that delete terrorist accounts, which is simply to create a surplus of back-ups.

For crypto fundraising to truly take off, though, jihadists in Syria needed more than just a currency like Bitcoin by itself. There were still serious obstacles in receiving Bitcoin donations—let alone actually spending them on anything productive.

To start, jihadi fighters in a place like Syria cannot buy food or clothing with Bitcoin directly. Just as your local supermarket prefers to use the currency of your country, so too does most any corner store, landlord, or weapons dealer in Syria. But members and supporters of these groups are finding ways to transfer Bitcoin into serviceable cash by integrating the technology with, ironically, old hawala methods.

This past spring, jihadists began promoting “Bitcoin Transfer,” a service run by jihadists in Idlib, Syria. The announcement of the service, written in English, Arabic, Turkish, French, German, and other languages, describes it as an “anonymous and safe way” to transfer money, written with language clearly meant to assure donors who would never have used crypto otherwise:

You want to receive money from Europe, Saudi, Asia, Africa and America and you don’t want to use unsafe transfer means for the one sending you the money? BITCOIN TRANSFER is the solution.

Services like Bitcoin Transfer show that there is both a demand for Bitcoin exchanges and a capacity to make money on them. But while services like Bitcoin Transfer solve the usable-currency issue, there remains the larger and perhaps more difficult obstacle of getting people to use it. It’s safe to presume the average jihadi supporter knows just as much about crypto as most people: it’s money (but not really money); supposedly secure, but maybe also kind of dangerous; and associated with a lot of shady activities. Thus, you can further presume how wary, or even plain confused a donor might be in using crypto to fund these fighters and groups.

There was, first and foremost, the issue of permissibility. Many banks and related services are, according to many Islamic fundamentalists, not allowed under Shariah law. Addressing these concerns, HTS released a 26-minute video this past July of one of its religious officials, Abu al-Fateh al-Farghali, describing Bitcoin use as permissible according to the Quran, effectively giving the green light for donations.

Promotion for video by HTS religious official

Adding to such messages is a growing wealth of educational material for the crypto layman who might want to donate to a fighter or group in Syria but doesn’t know how to. Bitcoin Transfer, for example, gives detailed breakdowns of how the service works, testimonials from ‘customers,’ and even offers prospective donors the option of contacting them if they have any questions about the process. A quick breakdown of the group’s services, as it describes them, reads:

Our work

1. The sender knows how to buy bitcoins: he sends us the bitcoin in our wallet, we convert them in dollar and you receive them in 3-4 days.

2. The sender doesn’t know how to buy bitcoins: the company helps him to buy bitcoins, we convert them in dollar and give you your money.

3. Depending on the country of the sender, we have other means of receiving your money.

All these elements—the transfer services, the religious green lights, the instructions—gave proof that jihadi groups can use crypto to safely, consistently, easily raise funds. And, as has been the trend for nearly a decade, what started in Syria would be emulated across the globe.

Perhaps it doesn’t catch much attention when Syrian groups and militants, obscure in some contexts, use Bitcoin. But what about one of the most diligently tracked, widely designated groups in the world?

“ Just as terrorists embraced social media, messenger platforms, and other technologies for recruitment and planning attacks, it was inevitable that they would add cryptocurrency for fundraising. ”

This past January, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the terrorist-designated military wing of Hamas, issued an announcement reading, “Izz ad-Din Qassam Brigades announces the beginning of receiving your financial support for the resistance by the currency ‘Bitcoin’ through the official wallet address and is only posted on the Qassam site.” The group has since then built an impressive financing infrastructure around Bitcoin, including an elaborate system in which a new Bitcoin address is generated for each user, intended to make the transfers much harder to source.

Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades has since released its own video showing how to purchase and send Bitcoin, with the same educational focus seen in Syria. The directions have come to span Arabic, English, French, Malay, Indonesian, Russian, and Turkish. In June, the group’s spokesman thanked those “who have responded and continue to respond to our call by helping the resistance with digital currency,” announcing further pushes for more fundraising efforts.

Hamas is not the only group outside of Syria using crypto. Jaish al-Ummah, a pro-al-Qaeda organization based in Gaza, launched its own Bitcoin fundraising campaign this past May, bluntly stating the aim to be supplying its fighters “with weapons and ammunition.”

Since 9/11, government agencies and financial institutions have together made major progress in cutting off terrorist financing. Money is, after all, a critical pillar of every terrorist group, powering everything from their media productions to actual attacks. To see terrorist groups use a yet-budding technology like crypto to sidestep this progress is a serious matter.

These developments shouldn’t be surprising. Just as terrorists embraced social media, messenger platforms, and other technologies for recruitment and planning attacks, it was inevitable that they would also add cryptocurrency for fundraising. It took years for social media companies and government agencies to understand—let alone act on—jihadist recruitment online, and the results of the delay were disastrous: thousands of people leaving home for battlefronts or carrying out attacks in their homelands. It is incumbent on us to learn from these mistakes, otherwise we are doomed to see a similar scenario play out in the financial realm.

Observing these evolving fundraising machines alone, President Trump’s abandonment of America’s allies on the ground will have effects cascading well beyond northern Syria. Based on what we’ve seen already—the successful fundraising drives, well-functioning (and even profitable) currency transfer infrastructures around them, and the recent adoption by groups outside of Syria—there is no reason to doubt that this model of terrorist fundraising will only spread to other fronts. And as long as the money keeps coming in for ISIS, al Qaeda, and other jihadist organizations, efforts to counter them will be in vain.",2019-10-13 09:13:45.944000+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/dutch-national-bank-says-gold-can-re-start-economy-in-case-of-total-collapse/,"Dutch National Bank Says Gold Can Re-Start Economy in Case of Total Collapse

An article found on the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) website has surprised many in the crypto space, with its bold claim that “If the entire system collapses, the gold stock provides a collateral to start over.” While proclamations of this nature are nothing new, it is strange to see a mainstream financial institution open up about the superior value of limited supply, sound money assets. A bit hypocritical, perhaps, given the diametrically opposed Keynesian practices regularly engaged in by central banks worldwide.

Dutch Bank Talks Global Reset

The translated article, entitled “Goud van DNB” (“Gold from DNB”) states: “If things go wrong, prices may fall. But, crisis or not, a gold bar always holds value.” DNB claims to hold over 600 tons (15,000 bars) of gold mainly in Amsterdam, with other stores in the U.K. and North America. The reserve is valued by the bank to be worth over €6B (~$6.62B). Calling gold the “trust anchor,” the article details briefly why the hard asset is so important to wealth building and the global economy, claiming:

Gold is … the trust anchor for the financial system. If the entire system collapses, the gold stock provides a collateral to start over.

On October 7, the bank also announced they’d soon be moving a large part of their gold reserves to “the new DNB Cash Centre at military premises in Zeist,” a local media outlet reported.

Even Unsound Banks Want Sound Money

DNB is no stranger to playing along with the Keynesian, inflationary games of the global monetary system. A system which, according to some, is now more a Ponzi scheme based on force and blind faith than sound economic principle. That notwithstanding, the centralized financial powers of the world know the real score, and that’s why hard assets like gold are hoarded and locked down while everyday, individual residents of these geopolitical jurisdictions are encouraged to spend and spend, going further into debt to prop up ultimately unsound national economies.

As news.Bitcoin.com reported on September 4, De Nederlandsche Bank is also set to begin cracking down on crypto exchanges and wallets, the bank stating that “firms offering services for the exchange between cryptos and regular money, and crypto wallet providers must register with De Nederlandsche Bank.” The demand for greater KYC/AML policy is a growing global trend, so there’s no surprise there. The remarkable part for many in the crypto space is the fact that invasive regulations and restrictions by central banks can be seen as yet another means of stockpiling precious assets. This time, not gold bars, but a limited monetary tool everyday people are now freely spending and saving more and more, with great effect: Bitcoin and crypto.

At the 2017 peak, when the Bitcoin price was trading at around $20,000 in the U.S. spot market, Bitcoin was being traded in South Korea’s cryptocurrency exchange market for around 26,000,000 Korean won, equivalent to about $22,000. This difference is now known as the Kimchi premium.

Since then, starting with the introduction of various regulatory frameworks by South Korea to reduce regional premiums that included the prohibition of trading cryptocurrencies with foreigners in the local market, premiums in major markets have declined substantially.

Still, due to the lack of supply and the relatively high demand in some markets, Bitcoin is being traded at a premium in certain regions — some higher than most.

Hong Kong’s OTC Bitcoin market: 2% to 4%

Following the prohibition of cryptocurrency trading by the People’s Bank of China, local banks in China were ordered not to work with local Bitcoin exchanges to prevent individuals and businesses from trading digital assets. Over time, the government of China also ordered payment processors such as AliPay to stop processing Bitcoin exchange-related transactions, according to report form Chinese blockchain publication 8BTC.

But reportedly, individual investors have continued to invest in Bitcoin after the ban. The imposition of a ban on cryptocurrency trading by China forced investors to move over to neighboring countries like Hong Kong, essentially initiating trades in a peer-to-peer manner.

On the over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform of OKEx, for instance, investors can trade Bitcoin using Tether (USDT), a stablecoin backed by the U.S. dollar, and then sell the USDT for the Hong Kong dollar. The premium on Bitcoin emerges when investors exchange USDT that they use to buy or sell Bitcoin for HKD, similar to most peer-to-peer OTC markets. On OKEx, USDT is being traded at around $1.02 to $1.04, which indicates a premium ranging from 2% to 4%.

Japan and South Korea: 0.2%

Most fiat-to-crypto exchanges in Japan and South Korea more or less follow the price trend of the U.S. spot market for Bitcoin. On Upbit and Bithumb, two of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, Bitcoin is being traded at 9,900,000 Korean won, equivalent to $8,365. On Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, Bitcoin’s price, as of Oct. 12, 2019, is hovering at around $8,345, indicating a slight premium of less than 0.25%.

While South Korea remains a relatively small market in comparison to Japan, the U.S. and Hong Kong, the prohibition on foreigners trading cryptocurrencies has eliminated a large portion of the demand for cryptocurrencies. In the 2017 bull market, the majority of large-scale trades in the South Korean market are said to have come from Japanese and Chinese investors and miners, decreasing the supply of exchanges.

The Japanese exchange market is also showing a slight premium of 0.2% and has seen most of its premium decline in the past two years. For spot or brokerage buys, which involve a direct wire transfer or a transaction through a payment processor directly to the exchange, there is a premium of 3.59%. On BitFlyer’s brokerage, the price for Bitcoin buys is estimated to be 936,621 Japanese yen, which is equivalent to $8,635 — nearly $300 higher than the global average spot price.

Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand: 1%–3%

The cryptocurrency exchange markets of Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand are mostly dominated by brokerages such as Coins, which is the largest exchange in the Philippines and was acquired by the largest ride hailing app in Indonesia called Go-Jek. Coins, which has more than 5 million users in the Philippines alone, enables users to buy or sell Bitcoin based on precalculated price like BitFlyer’s brokerage, which also typically sees a premium of over 3%.

On Coins.ph, the Philippines arm of Coins, Bitcoin has a buy price of 440,280 pesos, around $8,530, indicating a premium rate of 2.2%. BuyBitcoin.ph, the second most widely utilized brokerage in the Philippines, has a buy price of 443,300 pesos, showing a premium close to around 3%. On Coins.th, the Thailand arms of Coins, the buy price of Bitcoin is hovering at 256,637 baht, or $8,425, a premium of less than 1%.

Thailand had a dominant spot exchange called BX Thailand, but the local Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-approved exchange shut down on Sept. 30, citing a low level of volume. The closure of popular exchanges could result in a larger price discrepancy in the short term as volumes shift to brokerages. However, over the long term, the gap should close.

Chile and Brazil: 0.34%–1%

On exchanges that have been operating for years in South America, the price of Bitcoin closely matches that of the U.S. spot market, even on brokerages that have fixed buy and sell prices. On ChileBit, the Bitcoin price is being traded at around $8,374, with a 0.34% premium and on FoxBit in Brazil, the Bitcoin price is trading at $8,440, with a 1% premium. The premium of brokerages and spot exchanges in South America in general — with the exception of a few countries such as Venezuela and Argentina — is close to zero.

The low premium may indicate a low demand from local investors as Chile, Brazil and other bigger markets in South America are not known to have large-scale mining centers that provide liquidity to the global Bitcoin exchange market.

Unique markets: GBTC in the U.S., Venezuela and LocalBitcoins

Apart from small cryptocurrency exchange markets with relatively low liquidity, strictly regulated products that are often utilized by institutional and accredited investors to invest in the Bitcoin market consistently demonstrate substantially higher premiums.

The Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), for instance, which oversees close to $2 billion in assets and enables institutional and accredited investors to invest in Bitcoin through a regulated OTC exchange in the U.S., has a share price of $9.81. Each share of GBTC represents 0.00097368 BTC, which would imply that around 1,200 shares are equivalent to the price of 1 Bitcoin.

Based on the $9.81 share price of GBTC, each Bitcoin bought through the Bitcoin Investment Trust would be worth more than $10,000. Based on the current price of Bitcoin at $8,300, GBTC indicates a premium of over 20%.

Investors pay higher premiums for products like GBTC and exchange-traded products (ETPs) because they rely on third parties to secure their Bitcoin holdings. In recent months, GBTC has been trying to enable users to invest in Bitcoin at face value without the substantial premium by operating a private placement window. Whether this will decrease the premium of GBTC remains uncertain.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-receives-e-money-license-from-the-central-bank-of-ireland/,"Coinbase Receives E-Money License From the Central Bank of Ireland

Coinbase has secured a new legal foothold in Europe. The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange has received an e-money license from the Bank of Ireland, which it can potentially use to continuing serving its customers across the continent, in case Brexit causes any disruptions.

Coinbase Granted an Irish E-Money License

Coinbase announced over the weekend that the cryptocurrency exchange has been granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of Ireland. This is the second such European regulatory approval the company has obtained, as in March 2018 it received an e-money license from the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).

When Coinbase opened the Dublin office exactly a year ago, they said the local team would complement the company’s operations in London. Now, being one of just a few companies to receive the Irish e-money license, they can also rely on the new Ireland team to legally serve clients across Europe. This option could be particularity useful if a no-deal Brexit affects the acceptance of the British license by regulators on the continent.

“The approval from the Central Bank of Ireland will now enable us to expand our Irish operation and deliver a better product to customers across some of our fastest-growing markets. It will also allow us to secure passporting for our customers across the EU and EEA,” stated Zeeshan Feroz, the UK CEO of Coinbase. “We are committed to ensuring that our customers have the same safeguarding and security as any regulated financial institution, and the approval of a second European regulatory authority demonstrates our position as the world’s most trusted cryptocurrency platform.”

Ireland to Become Next Crypto Industry Hub?

Ireland has been very succusful in attracting multinational tech giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook to operate from its jurisdiction by offering them one of the most attractive tax regimes in Europe. The approval of Coinbase by the Irish central bank might be an indication that the country is open to becoming a launchpad for the European market to the digital assets industry as well.

The CEO of IDA Ireland, the state sponsored agency responsible for the attraction of foreign direct investment into the country, Martin Shanahan, commented: “Coinbase’s choice of Dublin for this operation reinforces the strength of Ireland as a destination for financial services companies, providing a consistent, certain, pro-enterprise policy environment for businesses to grow and thrive.”

Coinbase has also been busy recently securing its legal position across the pond. About two weeks ago it led a group of digital finance companies in the formation of the Crypto Rating Council, a member-operated organization created to help market participants comply with U.S. federal securities laws. The other founding members of this industry body are Anchorage, Bittrex, Circle, DRW Cumberland, Genesis, Grayscale Investments and Kraken. The purpose of the council is to provide a joint assessment of whether a specific token should be considered a security under American law.

Regulatory barriers are a major concern for businesses working with decentralized assets. Not all governments, however, are putting obstacles in front of crypto companies. In fact the number taking a crypto-friendly stance is in fact increasing.

Executives View Regulations as the Biggest Threat

Government regulations are a determining factor for the business climate crypto companies operate in. A recently published survey conducted among executives from the industry shows that the slow advance in that respect is a major concern. Over half of the respondents, 53% of CEOs polled by venture capital firm Digital Currency Group, singled out the regulatory environment as the main “enemy.” Other threats include a possible economic downturn and cybersecurity risks.

A quarter of the questioned managers admitted that compliance was the greatest challenge they faced last year, while a third stated that the lack of regulatory progress this year surprised them the most. Rules constricting the growth of cryptocurrencies are a much bigger concern to the industry than hacking attacks, for example. The situation can deteriorate even further with policymakers calling for increased oversight in the sector.

Existing regulations in many countries are quite inadequate as they don’t reflect the specifics of crypto-related economic activities, and where new ones are introduced they are often rather hostile. But there are a few notable exceptions, mostly in Europe, like Switzerland, Estonia, Belarus, Malta, and Gibraltar. Authorities in these jurisdictions have taken the lead to establish favorable regulatory frameworks that attract more crypto companies.

Three Countries Make Positive Steps

The number of governments with positive attitudes towards cryptocurrencies and entities working with digital assets is growing, and the crypto community has seen some promising developments over the last few months. These include the adoption of new legislation creating more business-friendly conditions for crypto companies as well presenting a favorable interpretation of tax rules that can save investors money.

Liechtenstein, which is considered by many to be an integral part of the expanding Swiss Crypto Valley, recently adopted a law that aims to clarify the regulatory environment for crypto businesses and attract more of them to the German-speaking principality. The “Token Act,” approved unanimously by its parliament, turns Liechtenstein into a secure location for service providers operating with digital coins and tokenized securities. The tiny Alpine nation hopes to become a major European fintech hub. Several dozen companies from the industry, including entities dealing with cryptocurrencies, are already based or represented in the country.

Regulatory uncertainty can put off businesses and individual investors. But two clarifications issued by Portugal’s tax authority position the country as a crypto tax haven in Europe. In its latest statement on the matter, the regulator said that transactions related to mining, the miner’s reward and its exchange to fiat, should be exempted from VAT. The agency has previously announced that although cryptocurrencies can generate taxable income, gains on their sale or appreciation received by private individuals are not subject to taxation.

Ukraine, which recently elected a younger and more tech-savvy generation of politicians to power, is also embracing cryptocurrencies. There is now a general consensus between government institutions, business circles, and civil society on the need to legalize decentralized digital assets and regulate related economic activities. Several new bills designed to accomplish that goal have been proposed or are currently being finalized. They should provide answers to questions concerning the legal status of cryptocurrencies and taxation in the industry.

If you need a really good example of a crypto-friendly nation, look to Slovenia. Authorities there have a very relaxed policy towards digital currencies. It’s legal in Slovenia to own and trade coins, and capital gains of individual crypto investors are not taxed. Government support has allowed for a thriving crypto industry to develop. One of its members, Eligma, is the startup behind the crypto payment processing platform Elipay which allows in-shop purchases with bitcoin cash (BCH) and other major cryptocurrencies. Mainly thanks to its services, the country now has the most BCH-accepting physical locations in the world, as news.Bitcoin.com reported, numbering over 400.

The risk of double-spending has traditionally been a major obstacle to creating and fully using digital money. A flaw of this kind would be detrimental to the credibility of any system claiming to provide universal solutions to the financial needs of our era. Whoever created Bitcoin elegantly solved the difficult task, but a growing ecosystem of related products and services comes with new threats and resurrects the challenge. It isn’t Bitcoin’s fault, but the danger is nevertheless present and a solution is needed.

Paynoway Tests Cryptocurrency Payment Applications

Developers have been working to protect you from some of the risks associated with products that expand the usability and utility of decentralized cryptocurrencies. The creators of a mobile application called Paynoway insist “double-spending is no longer a theoretical possibility but a practical reality.” They are offering software that allows you to verify transactions made through third party apps.

Most of the end-user applications widely available today leave their users vulnerable to being defrauded via double-spend attacks, the developers point out. “Paynoway is a tool that you can use to test the applications that you, or your business, depend on to accept on-chain cryptocurrency payments,” the team behind the app explains.

The tool has been developed specifically for Android-based devices and is currently available for free download in the Google Play store. The version that can be installed right now is the app’s initial release. According to the description, the application is still in development but users have been invited to try it and provide feedback.

In its Github repository, Paynoway is described as a mobile app for testing payment systems against double-spend attacks. The program allows users to provide the details of a cryptocurrency transaction and check if it involves double-spending.

Paynoway produces reports about the tested transactions listed with their IDs as well as resolutions corresponding to each individual transfer of digital funds. The type of a transaction is determined as a “payment” or a “double-spend,” and its status is marked as “confirmed” or “invalid” respectively.

Understanding Double-Spends With Crypto

Double-spending in the context of Bitcoin may occur when a user attempts to make more than one transaction with the same amount of money. And since this involves digital files that are generally easier to duplicate, someone may be tempted to try and pay more than once with the same bitcoin.

In peer-to-peer transfers, a user can attempt to broadcast two transactions, both of which will go into the unconfirmed transactions pool. But when these transactions are taken out and put into the blockchain they are checked for their validity and the second one won’t get confirmed.

When both transactions are validated simultaneously, two branches of the blockchain occur and a race between them begins. The first transaction to be confirmed in a block wins over the other. The more confirmations a transaction receives, the safer it is to consider complete.

Crypto payment applications provide businesses and individual users with much needed faster transfers which may involve accepting transactions with fewer or even zero confirmations. However, it’s not always guaranteed that a wallet, for example, will be able to detect both the original payment and a double-spend. And that’s where apps such as Paynoway can be useful.

Grayscale Investments has received regulatory approval to publicly quote shares of its diversified crypto fund. The product, which is the firm’s only diversified offering, invests in five main cryptocurrencies. In addition, the firm offers nine single-asset investment funds, some of which are also quoted publicly.

Fund Gains FINRA Approval

Digital currency asset manager Grayscale Investments announced Monday that shares of its diversified crypto fund have been approved for public quotation by the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a government-authorized nonprofit organization that oversees U.S. broker-dealers. Shares of Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (DLC) will be quoted under the symbol GDLCF on OTC markets. The company stated:

This marks the introduction of the first publicly-quoted security in the U.S. deriving value from a diverse selection of digital currencies.

DLC is an open-ended fund which “provides exposure to the top liquid digital assets through a market cap-weighted portfolio,” the firm described. As of Sept. 30, its components were a basket of five cryptocurrencies: 80.3% BTC, 9.9% ETH, 5.8% XRP, 2.2% BCH, and 1.8% LTC. The fund aims to cover 70% of the crypto market, and its components are reviewed on a quarterly basis. It currently has $15.7 million in assets under management and 3,194,900 outstanding shares.

The fund has been offered as a private placement to accredited investors since February last year. “Shares created through DLC’s private placement become eligible to sell into the public market after a statutory one-year holding period under Rule 144 of the Securities Act,” the firm clarified.

Single-Asset Funds

Besides the aforementioned diversified product, Grayscale offers various single-asset investment funds that provide exposure to BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, ZEN, LTC, XLM, XRP, and ZEC. As of Sept. 30, the firm managed approximately $2.1 billion in assets.

Grayscale clarified that DLC is its fourth publicly-quoted investment product available to all investors with access to U.S. securities. The others are Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC), Ethereum Trust (OTCQX: ETHE), and Ethereum Classic Trust (OTCQX: ETCG). Other investment funds are available to institutional and individual accredited investors.

None of the funds are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has yet to approve the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Last week, the commission rejected the last high-profile proposal it was evaluating, which was filed by NYSE Arca Inc. for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF. Earlier this month, Cboe BZX Exchange Inc. withdrew its proposal for the Vaneck Solidx Bitcoin Trust, which is now offered under Rule 144A.

With the rise in price and the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, more governments worldwide have been ramping up efforts to tax them. Some countries are using extreme measures to get their hands on this new source of untapped revenue, but there are also tax-friendly countries that are not taxing crypto transactions. Furthermore, many tools exist to help crypto owners.

Also read: IRS Issues New Crypto Tax Guidance – Experts Weigh In

Know How Your Government Taxes Crypto

Each country, state, or even city has its own set of rules when it comes to determining which crypto transactions are taxable. However, few have clear guidelines as cryptocurrency is still a nascent area for governments to tackle.

The U.S., for example, first released guidance for crypto taxation back in 2014, but left out many issues. Five years later, on Oct. 9, the country’s tax agency, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), published follow-up guidelines that answer many questions but also raise some unanswered ones. Besides, the tax agency seems to be confused about some key concepts such as how hard forks and airdrops work.

As a taxpayer, it is important to understand what is taxed in your country. In the U.S., the IRS explained:

The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability.

Furthermore, anyone who received cryptocurrency “from an airdrop following a hard fork,” will owe taxes “provided you have dominion and control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency,” the new IRS guidance details. Meanwhile, some crypto transactions are nontaxable such as donating cryptocurrency to qualified tax-exempt organizations.

Those Probing Questionnaires

As more governments realize cryptocurrency’s potential for generating tax revenue, they are also aware that they are missing out by not finding all crypto owners and taxing them. Some tax authorities worldwide have attempted to obtain information on taxpayers’ crypto holdings and activities through probing questionnaires.

The Indian Office of the Deputy Director of Income Tax has been mailing crypto owners a long list of questions, ranging from sources of income to the names of the cryptocurrencies traded and details about hardware wallets. The Canada Revenue Agency has also sent a detailed questionnaire to the citizens it believes to own cryptocurrency. Another example is the tax agency of Denmark, Skattestyrelsen, which has been authorized by the country’s tax council to obtain information about cryptocurrency trades conducted on some local exchanges.

On Oct. 11, the IRS published a draft of the new 1040 tax form which contains a question on cryptocurrency: “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?” This form is the main U.S. tax form used by over 150 million taxpayers.

More Aggressive Tactics

If tax authorities believe that a significant number of people are not reporting and fulfilling their tax obligations, they may employ various tactics to convince them to do so. The IRS, for example, has tried to remind crypto owners to pay taxes by mailing letters to more than 10,000 of them. It followed up with a video about another tax notice which seeks to rectify recipients’ tax reporting discrepancies. While these letters may seem like a big deal, some people believe that they are more of a phishing campaign since the agency simply does not have enough manpower to go after all crypto owners.

Tax agencies may also use more aggressive measures to boost their revenue. An IRS cybercrime presentation shows alarming recommendations on how tax agents should deal with crypto tax evaders, including questioning their friends and family, analyzing their social media posts, and issuing subpoenas. For Americans with more than $52,000 in overdue taxes, the agency may even revoke their passports until their tax bills are settled. Recently, the Turkish tax authority froze the bank accounts of over 3 million people for nonpayment of taxes.

Some Countries Are Much More Tax-Friendly

Each jurisdiction applies different tax rates and rules to crypto transactions. For example, Romania imposes a 10% tax on crypto earnings, Venezuela taxes up to 15% of crypto remittances, and one Swedish trader expected to pay 300% of his crypto profits in taxes. Japan, often hailed as one of the most crypto-friendly countries, taxes crypto income as high as 55%. However, a proposal is already in place to lower this rate in four different ways. India presently has no legal framework for cryptocurrency, but income from crypto assets can be taxed in three different ways. Portugal, on the other hand, has emerged as a crypto haven due to its policy to exempt cryptocurrency from capital gains tax and VAT. A local tax expert detailed:

The appreciation of cryptocurrencies or any gains on the direct sale of cryptocurrencies are not taxed in Portugal.

Knowing how other countries treat crypto assets for tax purposes can be beneficial, such as when choosing a more crypto tax-friendly place to move to. With some jurisdictions taxing crypto earnings and gains significantly less than others, some crypto investors have renounced their citizenship and relocated in order to lower their tax obligations.

There Are Tools to Help

If you want to file taxes and pay as little as possible, there are many tools to help you. Many software programs can help track your cryptocurrency transactions, calculate your tax liabilities, prepare and even file your tax returns. Some allow you to download your transaction data directly from exchanges and wallets. News.Bitcoin.com recently published a list of 10 useful tax tools for crypto owners.

Some People Are Still Not Paying

Despite intense efforts by tax authorities, many people in and around the crypto community strongly believe that taxation is a form of theft, and flat out refuse to pay them. A survey by personal finance firm Credit Karma shows that an increasing number of people would not declare their crypto income. One prominent tax evader is former antivirus tycoon and cryptocurrency advocate John McAfee. After fleeing the U.S. and declaring war on the IRS from his boat, he exclaimed:

I have not paid taxes for eight years and I have made no secret of it.

This morning, Bitcoin took another knock at opening, trading slightly lower alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency market and traditional markets.

XRP has thus far bucked the trend and is up 3% at the time of writing. With Bitcoin’s move out of the consolidation being hammered back last week, we will take a look at what may have been behind the rejection and what is likely to happen this week.

Daily crypto market data. Source: Coin360

BTC USD weekly chart. Source: TradingView

Bitcoin price was strongly supported by the 100 week moving average (WMA) which bounced the price back up towards $9,000 last week, before falling short of both the $9k handle and the major resistance at $9,500. There are now clearly defined battle lines drawn, with Bitcoin sitting closer to the lows of the weekly support rather than towards the highs.

On a macro level, while continuing to trade below the 20 WMA, Bitcoin favours the bears medium term with the 100 WMA being the last line of defence. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows momentum continues to favour the downside although the histogram is showing signs of flattening out.

The present trading range around $8,000 is of relatively high volume interest as shown by the high Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) node down the right hand side of the chart which shows the amount of volume traded at a given price.

If this level fails to hold, the next stop is likely to be the mid to low $6,000s with the 200 WMA being the last line of defense in the mid $4,000s.

Generally, the lower time frames are more useful in helping to identify what is most likely to occur over the next few weeks.

BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

A closer look at the daily chart reveals that Bitcoin is clearly being held back by the 200 DMA having broken out of a fairly well established trading range between $7,800 and $8,500. Bitcoin also briefly tested and broke through the 200 DMA before being smacked back down below $8,500.

The looming concern for bulls is the so called death cross of the 50 and 200 DMA which is on track to occur before the end of the month. The MACD is trending upwards but the histogram shows that the trend is not particularly strong, which implies that there is not much momentum to break the cluster of resistance overhead.

BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

The 4 hour Bitcoin chart clearly shows the rejection at the 200 DMA off the back of a strong bounce back into the range of $8150 - $8450 where the majority of buying and selling interest exists.

The bulls will need to maintain the upper 50% of the range and defend the $8,150 level to generate enough momentum to retest the rising 200 DMA which will be critical in the next couple of weeks. Another retest of the 200 DMA would imply that it could be weakening as a point of resistance so this would be an interesting development.

Bullish case

The 200 DMA is rising rapidly and continues to be an area which the bulls want to test. The chart shows that a higher high and a higher low were put in last week which is also a bullish sign. Another test of the rapidly rising 200 DMA could be in store should the bulls maintain the $8,150 level.

The VPVR illustrates that there is not a lot of volume in the $9,000 range so a push to this level could result in a similarly fast move to that which was seen on the way down and is somewhat reminiscent of the volume void above $4,000 earlier in the year.

Bitcoin’s On Balance Volume indicator (OBV) on the 4 hour chart continues to show that the cumulative buying volume is outweighing that of the selling volume within this consolidation period. This is atypical of an accumulation period.

BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

This idea is somewhat supported by data from Glassnode and the findings shows a large increase in the number of Bitcoin wallets holding 1000 BTC or more.

Bitcoin Addresses Holding > 1000 BTC. Source: Glassnode.com

The data interestingly shows that since Q4 2018, there have been significant increases in this metric which were unseen in the 2017 bull market. This implies that high net worth individuals and possibly institutions are accumulating rather than retail speculators.

Furthermore, there was largely sideways action in this metric once Bitcoin hit $9,000 on the way up during 2019 with some small profit taking visibly took place. It should be noted that since the breakdown from $10,000, there has been around a 10% increase in the number of wallets with large volume holdings.

The majority of these coins were accumulated with a lower average cost than current prices, likely holding an average somewhere in the $5,000 range. Therefore, it seems unlikely that they will be on the brink of capitulation anytime soon and are taking this price decline as an opportunity to acquire more market exposure

This is a positive sign for the bulls given that there has been no obvious accumulation spike since the one which preceded the break from $4,000 to 5,000, meaning that there is interest again from big players. On the flip side, the accumulation began in Q4 2018, following a significant sell off to the low $3,000s.

The conclusion here is that there is buying interest again in this range, but it does not mean that it will prop up Bitcoin’s price. Any further liquidity offered by another decline Is likely to be met with similar buying interest.

Bearish scenario

Despite the accumulation narrative being strong, it bears little impact on the impending issue in the market, which is the convergence of the 50 and 200 DMA which are on track to meet by the final week of October. The 50 DMA is also tracking the diagonal resistance which has now held Bitcoin down for several months.

BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView

Failure to break through this convergence of resistance would see calls for this move to be bear flag or ascending wedge and this would open the door to the $6,000 level. A failure to respond here would then open the door to retesting the 200 DMA and any trading below this point might induce calls for a prolonged bear market.

Looking forward

Overall, there are signs that buyers are looking for opportunities with big players becoming very interested in the retracement from the 2019 high. Maintaining price above $8,000 and another retest of the quickly rising 200 DMA is the main task for the bulls.

Currently, the bears are looking to take advantage of any signs of weakness if prices dip below $8,000. There is around 2 weeks remaining at the most before this market makes a definitive move for Q4 2019.

The study comes as some like J.P. Morgan blame the price decline of Bitcoin on “new futures contracts and an unwinding of long positions”. Indexica’s alternative explanation is that there are more factors that affect the Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market that is causing its price to be more sensitive. Indexica’s CEO, Zak Selbert, explained that “Bitcoin’s sensitivity to the development of competitors is just another sign of a coming of age”.

“Now that Bitcoin is a big kid, anything can make it move, just like anything can make gold or a G-10 currency move,” said Selbert. “Bitcoin is part of the financial landscape in a very intertwined and mature way.”

Among one of the top influences is “Quotability for Currency”, which explains “that it was most often talked about in conjunction with more traditional currencies”. But then competitors like Mastercard’s partnership with R3 to develop a new blockchain payment system also is shown to have a sizable affect on Bitcoin’s price.

A growing market brings growing influences

As Indexica’s CEO explains, this is a natural part of any technologies’ growing pains. When Bitcoin first emerged and entered the world stage, everyone simply wanted to buy some Bitcoin and either hold, spend, or trade their coins. Now, individuals can purchase/trade futures or invest in other blockchain projects by more traditional industry players like Mastercard, which might not be the favorite method of early adopters and disrupters, but do offer more diversification to large investors accustomed to certain businesses.

Additionally, there are now new cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies that are emerging with new technological innovations on top of blockchain and have achieved different business integrations. These integrations lead way for new companies to emerge and have their success or failure affect the price of Bitcoin since their progress can affect user adoption. The “Action Share for Ripple” is an example of an alternative blockchain tech company that affects the price of Bitcoin and one could even argue that Facebook’s Libra is another coin development project that would affect the price of Bitcoin.

Dash has an opportunity to develop and serve everyday users

As new investors and users enter the cryptocurrency market, they may focus on different ways to profit from Bitcoin which not only affects its price but also its development process. This can already be seen with some projects that have funding issues and are subject to vulnerability by the demands of third party donors. While Bitcoin has various market influencers affecting its price, Dash can utilize its self funding to focus on developing new technology and innovation to better serve its users.

As more investors and market movements push individuals out of the brand name of Bitcoin, consumers will be looking to find coins that better serve their needs. Dash thus has an opportunity to demonstrate to these individuals how it has faster and cheaper transactions than that of Bitcoin, sub two seconds, and transactions that cost less than 0.0005 USD with automatic InstandSend. Plus, Dash is now safer than Bitcoin against 51% attacks with ChainLocks and is even being recognized by exchanges like Coinbase with lower block confirmation times (2 blocks for Dash vs. 6 for Bitcoin).",2019-10-14 13:31:45+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-faces-drop-below-8000-despite-beating-price-resistance,"View

Bitcoin has crossed the 20-day moving average (MA) hurdle but remains in bearish territory below the long-term resistance of the 200-day MA.

Daily and weekly charts indicate scope for a drop to $7,750.

A UTC close above the 200-day MA at $8,718 is needed to weaken the bearish case.

Bitcoin appears likely to drop below $8,000, despite having scaled a widely tracked technical resistance level.

The top cryptocurrency by market value is trading above the 20-day moving average for the first time since mid-September. The MA line was crossed multiple times over the weekend, but on each occasion the breakout was brief.

At time of writing, BTC seems to have found more solid acceptance above the 20-day MA, having defended the level at $8,252 during the Asian trading hours on Monday.

The move above the 20-day MA is good news, according to popular analyst Josh Rager.

Rager is also expecting bitcoin’s price volatility to rise soon, as the Bollinger bands have converged sharply over the last few days. A low-volatility period, as seen in the last two weeks, often ends with a big move on either side.

While some traders may anticipate a big move to the higher side, given the price has scaled the 20-day MA, the technical charts remain bearish. Further, prices are still holding well below the key 200-day MA, which has acted as strong resistance over the last 2.5 weeks.

Daily and 4-hour charts

BTC carved out a large bearish outside bar reversal candle on Friday (above left), signaling an end of the recovery rally and shifting risk in favor of a drop below $8,000. That candle is still valid with prices holding well below the high of $8,820 hit on Friday.

As mentioned, the cryptocurrency is trading well below the 200-day MA at $8,718 (above left). BTC has failed to close above the long-term average multiple times since Sept. 27, dampening prospects of a stronger recovery rally and making it the level to beat for the bulls.

Above right, the 4-hour chart is reporting a failed double bottom breakout and a rising channel breakdown – a bearish setup.

Weekly chart

BTC ended last week on a positive note, but faced rejection at the 5-week MA, reinforcing the downward sloping average’s bearish bias.

The 5- and 10-week MAs continue to trend south this week, while the relative strength index (RSI) is holding bearish below 50.

All-in-all, BTC risks falling below $8,000 and extending losses, possibly to the 100-week MA support at $7,760, in the short term.

The bearish case would weaken if prices find acceptance above the 200-day MA at $8,718, but that looks unlikely at press time.

Following the unprecedented cryptocurrency boom in 2017, investors and governments alike could no longer ignore the growth of decentralized finance.

The world has become increasingly fascinated with cryptocurrencies and the ways they are enabling greater access, such as being able to send funds to remote places or securing capital for small businesses.

To aid this, cryptocurrency regulations are being slowly introduced into global financial markets. Regulations help to monitor these emerging digital currencies, and to allow for clearer guidelines and a measure of security.

The Regulatory Landscape

Today’s graphic from ComplyAdvantage maps out major regulatory cryptocurrency and exchange landscapes around the world, showing how sentiments towards digital currencies are evolving.

To do this, ComplyAdvantage measured cryptocurrency regulatory environments using their own Light-to-Tight scale, based on the following criteria:

Cryptocurrencies and exchanges status? (Ban = 3 points, Regulated = 2 points, Grey Area = 1 point)

Cryptocurrency considered legal tender? (Yes = 1 point, No = 0 points)

Planned legislation to increase crypto regulation? (Yes = 1 point, No = 0 points)

Which jurisdictions have the strictest and most relaxed regulations for cryptocurrencies?

Regulations by Region

Global attitudes towards the rise of cryptocurrencies have shifted greatly over the past few years. While the term cryptocurrency is a bit of a misnomer, some countries do consider digital currencies legal tender, with many viewing cryptocurrencies as commodities.

Below is a table of the major countries that are pursuing cryptocurrency regulations:

Country Cryptocurrencies Exchanges Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) Australia Legal; treated as property Legal, must register with AUSTRAC Regulated Switzerland Legal; generally accepted as payment Legal, regulated by SFTA Regulated Malta Not legal tender Legal, regulated under the VFA Act Regulated Estonia Not legal tender Legal, must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit Regulated Gibraltar Not legal tender Legal, must register with the GFSC Regulated Luxembourg Not legal tender Legal, must register with the CSSF Regulated Canada Not legal tender; some retailers accept as payment Legal, regulation varies by province; final federal regulations expected late 2019 Regulated Mexico Legal, accepted as payment in some contexts Grey area; first crypto exchange in opened mid 2019 Regulated Lithuania Not legal tender Legal, must register with the Lithuanian Finance Ministry Grey area United States Not legal tender; some retailers accept as payment Legal, regulation varies by state; SEC expected to publish updated crypto regulations late 2019 Grey area UK Not legal tender; considered assets Legal, registration requirements with FCA Grey area Russia Not legal tender Grey area; regulations to be determined by the end of 2019 Grey area Japan Legal; treated as property Legal, must register with the Financial Services Agency Grey area Nigeria Legal Grey area; regulations upcoming from Central Bank of Nigeria Grey area Singapore Not legal tender Legal, no registration required Grey area South Korea Not legal tender Legal and regulated, must register with FSS Banned India Not legal tender; digital rupee may be in the works Effectively illegal, but global and federal regulations being considered Banned China Bitcoin considered property; all other cryptocurrencies banned Illegal, but a global regulatory framework being considered Banned

Asia

Japan has one of the most progressive regulatory climates for cryptocurrencies, widely considering bitcoin as legal tender and passing a law in mid-2017 recognizing cryptocurrencies as legal property. In late 2018, Japan also approved self-regulation for the crypto industry.

By contrast, China currently has one of the most restrictive environments in the world for cryptocurrency. China banned bitcoin transactions in 2013, as well as ICOs and crypto exchanges in 2017─though many have found workarounds through sites not yet firewalled.

Europe

Cryptocurrency and exchange regulations in the EU are determined by individual member states, and are considered legal across the bloc.

Digital currency offers great promise, through its ability to reach people and businesses in remote and marginalized regions.

—Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of IMF

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Switzerland has one of the most open climates for cryptocurrencies and exchanges in Europe. In 2016, the city of Zug, known as “Crypto Valley”, started accepting bitcoin as payment for city fees. Swiss Economics Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann announced his goal in 2018 to make Switzerland the world’s first “crypto-nation”.

North America

Both Canada and the U.S. take a similar approach to cryptocurrency legislation at the federal level, as both countries view cryptocurrencies as securities. However, provincial and state regulations differ widely in their taxation requirements of profits from crypto investments.

Latin America

Regulations throughout Latin and South America run the full legislative spectrum.

Bolivia : unilateral ban on cryptocurrencies and exchanges

: unilateral ban on cryptocurrencies and exchanges Ecuador : the first country to launch its own token; ban on all cryptocurrencies aside from its government-issued SDE token (Sistema de Dinero Electrónico = electronic money system)

: the first country to launch its own token; ban on all cryptocurrencies aside from its government-issued SDE token (Sistema de Dinero Electrónico = electronic money system) Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Chile : cryptocurrencies widely accepted as payment

: cryptocurrencies widely accepted as payment Venezuela: cryptocurrencies widely accepted; this makes sense, considering the economic crisis and subsequent freefall of the bolívar

The Importance of Cryptocurrency Regulations

Cryptocurrency’s journey is the story of a technology rapidly outpacing the laws that govern it.

Governments around the world are keenly aware of this problem. Members of the G20 published a request in June 2019 for a global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies to be implemented to better manage the benefits and challenges that cryptocurrencies bring.

Regulation for both cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges is essential for the future of digital finance─bringing legitimacy to the digital financial market, and making it more attractive for new businesses, established banks, and investors worldwide to more easily conduct business within this emerging ecosystem.",2019-10-14 12:25:58-07:00,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/14/europol-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-underground-organized-crime-monero-privacy/,"Bitcoin BTC is still very much the dark web‘s favorite cryptocurrency, but those looking to cover their tracks are slowly learning to use privacy-focused alternatives.

“While we have previously reported a small shift towards more privacy-focused cryptocurrencies such as Monero, Bitcoin still remains the currency of choice for both legitimate and criminal use,” reports Europol with its latest assessment of internet-based organised crime.

Europol notes that Bitcoin‘s prevalence in the underground economy is a consequence of its familiarity within the customer base, particularly in dark web markets.

In particular, ransomware campaigns have continued to feature Bitcoin almost exclusively. Europol highlighted these attacks as the most prominent cybercrime it tackles.

Hard Fork has previously reported on numerous ransomware attacks that’ve demanded Bitcoin to restore encrypted files.

Still, authorities say there has been a more “pronounced shift” towards more privacy-orientated cryptocurrencies, and expects this trend to continue as criminals become more security aware.

“The main developments regarding this trend are on the Darknet [sic] markets, several of which also accept Monero, or in some cases exclusively trade in it,” Europol added.

Baskets allow investors to trade multiple financial instruments at the same time, without needing to manage the instruments separately. FXCM’s cryptocurrency basket has been named CryptoMajor and is made up of five virtual currencies – Bitcoin, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Ether.

Unlike other cryptocurrency baskets on the market, the CryptoMajor basket gives equal weighting to each coin in the basket. This means the product is not overly exposed to just one cryptocurrency.

Commenting on the launch, Brendan Callan, the CEO of FXCM, said: “Trading a basket of cryptocurrencies means our users are freed from the hassle of constantly monitoring the markets.”

“CryptoMajor therefore streamlines the trading process and protects our customers from unanticipated and adverse market movements. It is a great opportunity for our customers who are looking to move into Crypto trading but don’t want to risk too much overexposure.”

According to the statement, the CryptoMajor basket can be traded via all of the trading provider’s flagship platforms, in addition to MetaTrader 4, NinjaTrader, and also via API.

FXCM continues to expand crypto and FX offering

FXCM continues to expand its investment offering – both into FX and cryptocurrencies. As Finance Magnates reported, in May, the firm added CFDs on two new cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple (XRP).

Furthermore, the crypto basket announced today, is not the first product of its kind to be offered by the broker. Back in July, the FX and CFD trading provider launched forex baskets for its retail clients.

FXCM is offering three different baskets – the Dollar Index Basket, the Yen Index Basket, and the Emerging Markets Index Basket. As the names suggest, the US dollar, Japanese yen, and for the emerging markets basket, the US dollar also, have been used as the base currency for each basket.

A foreign exchange or forex basket is a mix of several currencies that all begin with the same equivalent value. Traders can then buy or sell a base currency against a mix of multiple currencies that are included in the basket. The value of the basket is dependent upon how the base currency performs against the other currencies in the basket since its inception.",2019-10-14 08:00:23+00:00,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/europes-most-trusted-crypto-and-precious-metal-companies-partner-to-create-gold-token-secured-by-bitcoin-network-300938111.html,"CoinShares, Blockchain, and MKS (Switzerland) SA form consortium behind DGLD, a network for digital gold secured by the Bitcoin blockchain

GENEVA, Oct. 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- A consortium comprising CoinShares, Europe's Largest Digital Asset Manager, Blockchain, the leading provider of cryptocurrency products including the World's most popular crypto wallet, and MKS (Switzerland) SA, part of the world's most trusted gold group, today announced that after two years in development, it has launched the DGLD network with more than $20M in gold digitized.

DGLD is a digital asset (token) representing allocated physical gold stored in a Swiss vault and tokenized with a side-chain built on the Bitcoin network. Best understood as a digital proof of ownership of allocated gold, DGLD leverages the power and immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain to provide convenient purchasing of gold with the independence of physical gold ownership, and the 24/7 nature of digital assets.

Each DGLD token is the digital equivalent of 1/10th of a troy ounce of gold, vaulted in Switzerland. Before a new token is created, LBMA1 gold is allocated and placed in a Swiss vault. Then, DGLD representing that specific gold is created and sent to a DGLD wallet. This simple approach unleashes physical gold and renders it both digitally usable and physically redeemable.

Danny Masters, Chairman of CoinShares, commented on today's news, ""DGLD combines the stability of the world's most enduring asset, gold, with the security of the world's most resilient network, Bitcoin. You can now have the peace of mind of Swiss vaulted physical gold, with the same convenience, but not the same layers of middlemen, as owning a gold ETF.""

Gold has long been trusted as a hedge to geo-centric economic and political crisis, and inflationary monetary policy but gold ownership has always come with trade-offs. Traditionally, purchasers either buy a synthetic product such as an ETF for convenience, which comes with multiple layers of intermediaries, or buy and vault physical gold. DGLD represents a new format that provides convenience and security; without the middlemen.

DGLD is not intertwined in this same legacy structure; nor, under Swiss law, is it subject to the same regulatory constraints as synthetic gold investments (e.g. exchange traded products like ETFs). It falls under category 5 of FINMA's stablecoin taxonomy - 'linked to commodities with ownership rights.' In other words, if you hold a DGLD token, you hold title to the gold - no web of intermediaries and not subject to any prudential licensing requirements under Swiss law.

""DGLD is the natural progression of our work with gold, and gold formats at MKS. With DGLD, we've created a new format for gold ownership which makes vaulted physical gold, digitally useful, 24/7. This has the potential to profoundly change the way gold is used in every day life,"" said Marwan Shakarchi, Chairman of MKS (Switzerland) SA.

DGLD will first be available exclusively on The PIT, Blockchain's institutional-grade cryptocurrency exchange, later this quarter. The PIT has a diverse, global group of leading market markers and a deep lending pool to ensure constant liquidity on the platform. It is available to users in more than 200 countries, with an expansive global banking network to facilitate deposits, withdrawals, and fiat-to-crypto trading in USD, EUR, and GBP.

""For centuries, gold has played a vital role in how governments and institutions' manage global economic risks. But for retail investors, physical ownership of gold at any meaningful size has remained unattainable or their money is funneled into complex investment products,"" says Peter Smith, Co-founder and CEO of Blockchain. ""With DGLD, global purchasers of all sizes will be able to own and secure gold just like financial giants, without the high barrier to entry of legacy options.""

The DGLD network leverages a technology stack built on CommerceBlock's Ocean sidechain platform. CommerceBlock is a London-based blockchain infrastructure development firm building enterprise solutions on top of Bitcoin. Through CommerceBlock's MainStay attestation protocol, every DGLD token redemption for physical gold, or any transfer of tokens to another wallet is cryptographically attested and ""proven"" (validated) via the Bitcoin blockchain; the world's most secure network.

DGLD was designed for both retail and institutional investors, many of whom require a regulated custodian to safeguard their investments. To that end, the consortium has partnered with Globacap, the UK regulated capital markets firm to offer digital asset custody. Globacap is the first authorized custodian in Europe to provide digital asset custody for institutions with the same level of rigorous oversight and robust processes expected of a tier 1 global custodian.

The world’s most popular cryptocurrency has traded flat for the better part of the last 24 hours, with an intraday high of around $8,400. In the last couple of hours, BTC took a sudden dip below the $8,200 price mark, showing a loss of more than 2% on the day.

Bitcoin’s average daily trading volume hovers about $15 million, while its market share has decreased to 66.3%, which is the lowest level since the beginning of August.

Cointelegraph contributor filbfilb expects Bitcoin to take a further dip and test the $8,000 price mark once again. He told subscribers of his Telegram channel:

“Moving averages are crossed bearish on every major timeframe up to but not including the weekly.”

On the positive side, BTC is still up 120% compared to the beginning of the year when it was trading in the range of low $3,000s.

Ether (ETH), meanwhile, isn’t doing much better and is back to trading around the $180 price mark. The No. 1 altcoin hit an intraday high of $187, but has since been declining to its current trading price, down 3.07% at publishing time.

Many were hoping to see Ethereum continue its upside momentum towards $190 to $200, but the approach to the next critical resistance area was seemingly too much to handle for the altcoin.

Altcoins are showing a price downturn that might be a sign of worse things to come.

The top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap are mostly showing red candlesticks, with EOS being hit with a loss of more than 6%. Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA) and Chainlink (LINK) are all showing losses of about 5% on the day.

The Supreme Court of India has set a new date to resume hearing the arguments against the crypto banking restrictions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The central bank has replied to crypto exchanges’ representation as directed by the court, which was supposed to resume hearing the case today.

Supreme Court Hearing Rescheduled Again

The Indian supreme court was scheduled to resume hearing the arguments against the banking restrictions by the RBI today, Oct. 15. According to the court order issued earlier this month, the case was to be listed “top of the board,” which gave the Indian crypto community hope that the case would move forward today.

However, Indian news portal Crypto Kanoon reported that the case was listed as item number two in courtroom number five today. “Since three judges bench has assembled today in court no. 5,” the news portal said that “The court could not hear the case.” The court order for this case was published on Tuesday. It reads:

Upon hearing the counsel the court made the following order … List on Tuesday, the 19th November, 2019 as first item, subject to overnight part-heard, if any.

In previous hearings, only two judges heard the crypto case, and usually the same judges would continue to hear the case. Whenever a three-judge bench is assembled, the likelihood of the supreme court hearing the crypto case diminishes.

RBI Ban and Government Regulation

The central bank issued a circular in April last year banning financial institutions from providing services to crypto businesses. Prohibited services include “maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer / receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase/ sale of VCs [virtual currencies],” the RBI explained.

The ban went into effect three months later and banks closed the accounts of crypto exchanges, forcing some of them to close down local exchange operations. A number of industry stakeholders immediately filed writ petitions to challenge the ban.

After multiple delays, the supreme court began hearing the case in detail on Aug. 8, with the petitioners extensively challenging the central bank’s power over crypto. The RBI ban has also affected the Indian police. The Pune city police department was unable to cash out its seized crypto from a Ponzi scheme due to the ban.

The Indian government is still deliberating on a draft bill submitted by an interministerial committee (IMC) in February. The bill, which seeks to ban all cryptocurrencies except state-issued ones, was made public on July 23. However, the Indian crypto community believes that the bill is flawed and has been campaigning to convince lawmakers to reexamine the IMC recommendations.

Editor’s Note (Oct. 15, 6:26 p.m. EDT): This article has been updated with the court order and the date the crypto case is to be listed.

With the expanded cryptocurrency intelligence platform launched today, in addition to Bitcoin (BTC), CipherTrace customers can now trace more than 700 tokens. Combined, that comprises more than 87 percent of the volume of the top 100 cryptocurrencies*, including Ethereum (ETH), Tether, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). CipherTrace’s increased monitoring support further includes the capability to trace several hundred ERC20 tokens.

“I would emphasize that this giant leap in blockchain visibility was no easy feat,” said Shannon Holland, CipherTrace CTO. “It has taken intense work and technological breakthroughs over the last four years, as well as collaboration with regulators and financial investigators. We can now discern and automatically verify previously unfathomable amounts of blockchain data and characterize it with a high level of confidence. We will continue to add more tokens, stablecoins, and blockchains in the coming months.”

CipherTrace’s proprietary algorithms, digital enrichment, advanced clustering, and tradecraft combine to deliver unprecedented traceability and resolution to previously unknowable public blockchain information. Additionally, CipherTrace has 522 million attribution data points—such as account type, account holders, contract types, contract owners and other metadata—on cryptocurrency addresses.

“Only by helping virtual asset service providers rid their networks of criminals and terrorists will the industry achieve the level of trust required for widespread adoption and government acceptance,” said Dave Jevans, CEO of CipherTrace. “Until now, large swaths of the cryptocurrency ecosystem have remained opaque to AML and CTF monitoring. By delivering the most comprehensive cryptocurrency intelligence, we are helping to create a multi-trillion-dollar global crypto economy.”

Support for 700 currencies available immediately

The expanded tracing capabilities included in the latest CipherTrace Cryptocurrency Intelligence platform are immediately available to end-users via the CipherTrace API for an automated monitoring. Users will have the power to explore complete BCH, ETH, ERC-20, LTC and USDT addresses and view valuable details on transactions, wallets, exchanges and smart contracts. Financial investigators can also now trace Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin addresses forwards and backward in their transaction history.

“Bitcoin takes center stage in financial crime investigations because it is the easiest crypto to obtain and has the largest transaction volume. Still, billions of dollars move through alt-coins daily,” explained CipherTrace’s head of financial investigations, Pamela Clegg. “To close cryptocurrency money laundering gaps, we must expose more of the true number of illicit transactions that occur across the entire ecosystem. This platform expansion does just that by providing regulators, exchanges, and investors visibility into more than 87 percent of the virtual asset market trading volume.”

Unique Ethereum ERC-20 Expansion Features

CipherTrace users can now also explore ERC-20 transactions of interest, or research and explore smart contracts. With a single click on the contract icon, CipherTrace can highlight details of the smart contract, including all transactions, counterparties, and counterparty attribution.

“Banks and other crypto asset businesses will benefit immensely from the addition of support for ERC-20 and other significant tokens,” continued Jevans. “Fully complying with AML/CFT regulations requires monitoring ERC-20 transactions for illicit activity. In addition, exchanges need to assure their banking partners that they understand and can monitor the risks associated with these and similar tokens.”

New Alerting Feature Automatically Notifies Users of Payment and Risk Changes

The enhanced platform also includes alerting features to deliver notifications of transactions and changes to address risk ratings. Watchlist addresses are constantly monitored, and alerts are sent every time an address of interest sends or receives payments.

Why is everyone discussing big crypto transactions?

Actually, such transactions might be a contributor to the uptick in crypto markets.

In early April, Bitcoin (BTC) saw the first major recovery in months, when the price of the world’s top coin rose from around the $4,000 mark to over $5,000. The industry was actively discussing the reasons behind the unexpected surge. While some insiders — such as Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao — were clueless about the catalysts of the spike, others mentioned the April Fool’s Day story on the prank-approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund and even Brexit as possible triggers.

However, some believe that mysterious crypto orders could be accountable for the market recovery. According to Reuters, the gain was probably triggered by a 20,000 BTC order (over $100 million, at that time) that was spread around United States-based crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, as well as Luxembourg’s Bitstamp.

Big volume transactions could kick-start a frenzy of algorithmic trading — a method that uses automated software to detect trends and determine when trades should be made. As the mechanisms recognized the gigantic order, the automated trading started, forcing the prices and volumes to rise for several days in a row, with Bitcoin briefly testing the $5,300 mark.",2019-10-16 11:22:00+01:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/16/libras-co-creator-touts-progress-after-exodus-of-the-crypto-backers.html,"The co-creator of Facebook-backed libra defended the cryptocurrency on Wednesday after a number of recent high-profile companies abandoned the effort.

Libra ran into issues Friday after Visa, Mastercard, Stripe, eBay and Mercado Pago bolted. Booking Holdings, formerly Priceline, left Monday. Each of the companies would have potentially invested $10 million each into the project.

The digital currency will not be run by Facebook, but rather by a nonprofit association supported by a range of companies and organizations.

""It wasn't a tough week,"" said David Marcus, head of Facebook's Calibra digital wallet, which can serve as a way to store and exchange Libra. Calibra won't be the only wallet. It will interact with other Libra-accepted platforms.

""I would rather have all of these companies come with us,"" he added, saying that he understands companies have to respect shareholders who are skeptical of the digital coin.

Instead, Marcus pointed to Libra's progress in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. The founding members, including Uber, Lyft and Spotify, held their first meeting on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland where they settled on an organizational structure and a five-seat board of directors, including Marcus and representatives from Libra-backer Andreessen Horowitz, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm.

The goal of Libra — using blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin on other cryptocurrencies — is to make it as easy to send money across the world as it is to send a photo. But unlike bitcoin and others, Libra will be backed by more stable government-backed money.

Governments so far have been skeptical of the digital coin, with policymakers around the world upping pressure on libra. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to face Congress next week to answer questions on libra.

Though Marcus stressed on Wednesday that the project is just that: an idea with room for improvement. Libra, which was announced in June, is aiming to launch in the first half of 2020.

""It's kind of odd that all of this is happening at the stage of this project because it's a project. It's an idea. It's a whitepaper. Nothing is operating yet,"" he said when asked about the political pressure. ""It's kind of sad in a way to see all the issues that we currently have with the current system.""

Marcus, testifying before House lawmakers, also indicated in July that the group fully plans to move forward with libra.

When asked by Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., whether Facebook would postpone its launch plans until regulations were in place, Marcus didn't give a definitive answer. Waters said his answer ""was not a commitment.""",2019-10-16,https://cointelegraph.com/news/yes-even-bitcoin-hodlers-can-lose-money-in-the-long-term-heres-how,"Since dropping from its 2019 high at $13,800, Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a rut which has led to the price retracing roughly 43% to $7,800. Traders would take a more conservative approach and describe the last two months of price action as consolidation which is typical after parabolic advances. With the 2020 Bitcoin halving event approaching, the ultimate question on the minds of most investors revolves around whether or not Bitcoin will reach a new all-time high on the heels of the event and more importantly, when.

While every trader has his or her own style, most keep a vigilant eye on Bitcoin charts and attempt to exploit every long and short opportunity that Bitcoin’s market cycles provide. This practice can be time-consuming, tiresome and inefficient based on one’s proficiency at trading and the ability to weather the manipulative fiascos that frequently rock the crypto market.

As the crypto market matures, new technical analysis methods are being developed and traders are also beginning to pay more attention to the on-chain data produced by blockchains. To dig deeper into this topic, Cointelegraph spoke with equities and crypto-market analyst Philip Swift. Swift is also the creator of the Golden Ratio Tool and the Bitcoin 2-Year MA Multiplier.

Cointelegraph: Philip, thanks for taking the time to sit down to have a chat about crypto trading and technical analysis. What brought you to crypto?

Philip Swift: My route into crypto was less exciting than buying drugs on Silk Road, unfortunately! In 2016 I was looking to invest some profits from real estate investing. Traditional market investment opportunities looked awful as they were offering poor returns for reasonable amounts of risk. I also felt uncomfortable with the inevitable handing over of fees to some broker or money manager who probably wasn’t great at their job.

I then came across Bitcoin and saw it had a much more appealing risk/reward opportunity. As I learned more about it, I could see the benefits from a social perspective too, which I thought was really interesting. So I fell down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.

CT: Why is it important to view Bitcoin’s price action on a logarithmic scale? Should this always be done in your opinion?

PS: There is real value in viewing Bitcoin’s price action on a logarithmic scale because it allows you to see two things. First, you can see the adoption curve of Bitcoin over its 10-year history as more and more people begin to use it.

Second, you can see that contrary to the popular belief that Bitcoin has only had a recent price explosion that was a bubble, Bitcoin has actually gone through three full market cycles in its 10-year history. This context is useful for helping us forecast potential price action and also for managing emotions as we enter into the next market cycle.

I definitely don’t think a logarithmic scale should always be used. Thinking in absolutes is very dangerous, particularly when it comes to trading and investing. There are times where a standard scale is very useful, particularly when trading small time frames in certain market conditions.

CT: Given the unique insight on-chain data provides, do you think traders' reliance on the investing strategies and tools used for traditional financial markets is a misapplication? Why should traders focus more on on-chain data?

PS: I think of all these different approaches like tools in my toolbox. If I want to build something brilliant, I need to have a range of tools to achieve that.

I find it strange in the world of Crypto Twitter that there are people who say they only use technical analysis (TA) or only use on-chain analysis. Why would you limit yourself when clearly these different schools of thought all have value when they are applied correctly? So I use a combination of TA, on-chain metrics, and market cycle analysis. This process has consistently worked very well for me over time.

My sense is that there are people in the space who have either learned from ‘experts’ used to operating in traditional markets like the Forex or they aspire to be the traditional type traders having watched some TV shows and movies. For these reasons, they think that Bitcoin should also be measured using traditional tools from these traditional markets.

This is way off the mark in my opinion as Bitcoin has characteristics that are very different from other asset classes, and more importantly, it is not yet an established asset class. It is going through a period of adoption. This makes it function differently to macro asset classes and established currency markets.

CT: How would you interpret the current Market Value Realized Value Z-score (MVRV-Z score) and could you explain this to a simpleton such as myself?

PS: The current MVRV Z-score is at levels we would expect at this point in the market cycle. In my opinion, there is still plenty of upside to go before we reach the cycle high.

MVRV Z-score highlights periods where the price of Bitcoin is extremely over or under-valued relative to its historical ‘fair value’. The indicator has been able to pick Bitcoin’s major cycle highs to within two weeks!

When it enters the upper red band on the chart, this indicates that price is overvalued and most likely needs to have a major pullback on big timeframes - otherwise known as entering a bear market.

CT: Your Bitcoin Golden Ratio indicator suggests that:

“If this decreasing Fibonacci sequence pattern continues to play out as it has done over the course of the past 9 years, then the next market cycle high will be when the price is in the area of the 350DMA x3.”

According to your indicator, this is around $19,971. Some traders say a bull market does not officially start until an asset breaks through the previous all-time high. At this price, your indicator would be showing overstretched conditions so barring a massive blow-off top, what can one forecast past the 350DMA x 3?

PS: Like any moving average, the Golden Ratio Multiplier moving average lines move with Bitcoin’s price. So as price increases, so do they. Therefore, by the time the price gets to the $20,000 area, the 350DMA x 3 will be much higher. In effect, the price will be trying to catch up with the 350DMA x 3, and it is unlikely to do that until they are both well above $70,000 this cycle in my opinion.

CT: What’s the likelihood that Bitcoin simply consolidates between $8,500 - $10,000 and $10,000 - $11,500 until the next halving event? How does on-chain data support this narrative?

PS: Unlikely. The halving is still 7 months away and we are seeing a lot of accumulation happening on-chain.

I do believe this upcoming halving event will create significant buying demand for Bitcoin. Markets are not efficient, and we are not rational players. I think the halving event hype coupled with global macro issues we are seeing play out as we head towards it will create hype for Bitcoin that will push the price up as people FOMO in.

CT: In your most recent tweet, you said that you believe that Bitcoin is currently in phase A of the Puell Multiple. Is this a multi-year measurement/cycle?

Puell Multiple Chart. Source: Lookintobitcoin.com

PS: Yes it is. I was highlighting how, just like the previous two major Bitcoin cycles, we have entered a period where the Puell Multiple became over-extended and had a sharp dropdown. Both of those periods were then followed by Bitcoin price action going sideways for 6-8 weeks. I am not saying that has to happen now, but it is certainly noteworthy.

CT: What else do you want to tell me? Are there any additional hot topics, statements or opinions of importance that you think the world should know?

PS: In the world of Bitcoin there seem to be two main groups of people. Hodl’ers and traders. HODL’ers think you should hold forever and constantly dollar cost average in. Traders try to grow their Bitcoin stack using leverage.

Both of these approaches have issues. HODL’ers have to endure multi-month bear markets with 80%+ drawdowns on their holdings. So it’s quite inefficient and actually poor from a risk management perspective. The vast majority of traders (over 90%) lose money in the long run so that approach is not ideal either..

I believe that there is a smarter approach for most people. Strategic investing, which requires just a basic understanding of Bitcoin’s market cycles and its economics. This can help you avoid buying towards the top and selling towards the bottom of Bitcoin’s cycles.

Over the course of Bitcoin’s history, people who have used this approach have significantly outperformed all HODLers and the vast majority of traders.

Here is a really simple chart from my site that brings this to life. If you bought Bitcoin whenever the price was under the green moving average and then gradually sold out in the red zones above the red moving average, then you would have achieved outsized returns relative to most other Bitcoin investors and traders.

CT: What is your approach to crypto investing? Intraday trading, swing trading, BTC accumulation, Fiat accumulation?

PS: I swing trade crypto and also make long term investments in Bitcoin. I don’t want to spend my days stuck in front of the computer screen staring at 15-minute charts so I choose to swing trade on multi-week time frames which suits my trading style.

CT: What is the ultimate purpose of Look Into Bitcoin?

PS: I want it to help regular people (not just large institutions) invest better in Bitcoin, as I believe Bitcoin is a once in a generation opportunity that is leveling the financial playing field.

By providing free-market cycle and on-chain valuation tools for regular Bitcoin investors, it helps them see more clearly and think differently about Bitcoin prices, and ultimately supports their Bitcoin investing.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardforkbasics/2019/10/16/understanding-bitcoins-smallest-unit-the-satoshi/,"Welcome to Hard Fork Basics, a collection of tips, tricks, guides, and advice to keep you up to date in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world.

Last week, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) included the word ‘Satoshi.’

To celebrate this significant milestone, we thought it would be a great time to explain what a Satoshi is, how it works, and why it’s important for Bitcoin.

What is the Satoshi

Put simply, a Satoshi is the tiniest unit of Bitcoin in existence.

As you’ve probably already guessed, it’s named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator — or creators — of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology.

Understanding it

Unlike fiat currencies such as the British Pound, the US Dollar, or the Euro, Bitcoin only exists in the digital world.

Despite this obvious difference, Bitcoin and fiat currencies have something in common: they can be broken up into smaller units.

So, the pound has pence, the dollar and the euro have cents, and Bitcoin has Satoshis (or Sats, for short). It’s essentially another way of expressing an amount of Bitcoin without making it unnecessarily confusing

A Satoshi represents one hundred millionths of a Bitcoin. By being able to break up Bitcoin transactions into smaller denominations, they become easier to read and understand.

So, 1 Bitcoin is equivalent to 1,000 millibitcoins (mBTC), 1,000,000 microbitcoins (μBTC), or 100,000,000 Satoshis.

Now, while the exact figure is unknown, estimates suggest that Satoshi Nakamoto may own 1 million BTC, which given what we’ve just explained, would be equivalent to 100,000,000,000,000 Satoshis.

Why are they useful?

Similarly to pence or cents, Satoshis come in handy when you want to send a relatively small amount of Bitcoin to someone.

Imagine you want to send someone 1,000 Sats – that’s a lot easier to understand compared to 0.0000001 Bitcoin.

Being able to count the Sats makes Bitcoin less intimidating, making users feel like they actually own something.

Finding a symbol

Bitcoin’s currency symbol or glyph (฿) has been around for some time. In fact, it was first used by Nakamoto in an early release of the Bitcoin client — Apple even added it to the iOS12 keyboard last year.

But, while ‘฿’ has become widely accepted among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the community is yet to find a symbol for the Satoshi.

The discussion has been going on for a considerable amount of time but no consensus has been reached.

And while there’s still time, Satoshis are likely to become increasingly relevant if Bitcoin’s price rises.

If people start to use Bitcoin to purchase mundane everyday items such as milk, bread, or even a cup of coffee, it’ll be necessary to have something in place which makes the technology easier to understand and communicate.

But if we’ve learned anything about this industry, it’s that it will take time.

The U.S. has many regulators responsible for overseeing different aspects of crypto assets, each with its own stance on how they should be regulated. Major regulators in the U.S. with strong opinions on cryptocurrency include the SEC, the CFTC, the Federal Reserve, Fincen, and the IRS.

Also read: Tax Guide: What Crypto Owners Should Know



The Securities and Exchange Commission

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has statutory authority over crypto assets that are deemed “security,” with its oversight extending to the offer, sale and trading in those assets. A number of companies have tried to obtain the agency’s approval for bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but all proposals have been rejected so far.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in an interview last month that the commission is closer to approving a bitcoin ETF than it was before. However, he added that “there’s work left to be done,” raising a number of questions he needed answered. “How do we know that we can custody and have a hold of these crypto assets? That’s a key question,” the chairman opined. “And an even harder question, given that they trade on largely unregulated exchanges, is how can we be sure that those prices aren’t subject to significant manipulation.” Clayton elaborated:

Progress is being made but people needed to answer those hard questions for us to be comfortable that this was the appropriate type of product.

The chairman and other SEC commissioners also appeared before the House Financial Services Committee last month for which they answered some crypto-related questions. Regarding Facebook’s planned Libra coin, Clayton told the committee that he had not discussed the matter with the company, concerning whether Libra will be a security, emphasizing that he was “not prepared to make a decision like that here.” He further remarked:

Cryptoassets, while they have benefits … can present a great deal of risk, particularly in cases where, in form, they are the same as securities or the same as currencies, or the same as payment systems, but they’re not regulated in the same way.

Meanwhile, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, aka Crypto Mom, said “I would like to see us be a little more forward-thinking” on the use of utility tokens, adding that “I am hoping we can work to create some sort of safe harbor.” The crypto-friendly commissioner has repeatedly spoken favorably on the subject. “As technology changes, we’ll see them becoming much more the money of the internet,” the commissioner recently said.

Peirce also believes the time is right for a bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, the commission has green-lighted two token offerings under Regulation A+.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has broad authority over derivatives and commodities, and crypto-asset derivatives and commodities are regulated in the U.S. in the same manner as any other derivative or commodity.

At the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in New York City on Oct. 10, CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert talked about CFTC’s jurisdiction over crypto assets. He said:

We’ve been very clear on bitcoin: bitcoin is a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act. We haven’t said anything about ether – until now. It’s my conclusion as chairman of the CFTC that ether is a commodity and therefore would fall under our jurisdiction.

“My guess is that you will see, in the near future, ether-related futures contracts and other derivatives potentially traded,” the chairman continued, adding that forked assets should be treated as the original assets. Tarbert succeeded J. Christopher Giancarlo as the chairman of the CFTC in April.

Under Giancarlo, the CFTC oversaw a number of crypto derivatives and approved several companies such as Ledgerx and Erisx. Two major derivatives exchanges, CME and Cboe, both self-certified to list bitcoin futures products. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, launched Bakkt last month. Giancarlo explained:

CFTC regulatory practice is for exchanges to self-certify that new contracts meet CFTC core principles before listing. This approach has allowed for robust and dynamic risk transfer markets to develop and test new products without a time-consuming application process.

The Federal Reserve

The Federal Reserve System, the U.S. central bank, is responsible for conducting monetary policy, promoting financial system stability, supervising financial institutions, and fostering payment and settlement systems. With increasing regulatory concerns over Facebook’s Libra digital currency project, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was asked last month during a discussion with Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas J. Jordan in Zurich, whether he believes that central banks are missing out on opportunities presented by digital currencies. He replied:

We are following very carefully the whole question of digital currencies … It’s not something that we are actively considering … For us, it raises substantial, significant issues that we want to see carefully resolved.

The chairman proceeded to talk about cyber issues and the lack of demand for cryptocurrency, asserting that “consumers have plenty of payment options.” His statement echoes his testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs in July when he said “We haven’t seen widespread adoption” of cryptocurrency. He believes that no one uses bitcoin for payments, noting:

They use it more as an alternative to gold, really. It’s a store of value. It’s a speculative store of value like gold.

Nonetheless, he admitted the possibility that the need for a reserve currency in the traditional sense would be diminished or even removed should cryptocurrency become prevalent throughout the globe.

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen) is the lead regulator for the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), the primary U.S. AML/CFT regulatory regime. Fincen announced back in March 2013 that AML laws apply to “persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting, or transmitting virtual currencies,” subjecting them to money services business (MSB) registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations.

In May, the regulator published a 30-page document entitled “Application of Fincen’s Regulations to Certain Business Models Involving Convertible Virtual Currencies,” which clarifies registration requirements for MSBs. On Oct. 11, Fincen issued a joint statement with the SEC and the CFTC to remind anyone engaged in crypto activities of their AML and CFT obligations under the BSA.

The Internal Revenue Service

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been active in taxing crypto owners. The agency has sent several warning letters to remind them to pay taxes. In general, the IRS explained that “The sale or other exchange of virtual currencies, or the use of virtual currencies to pay for goods or services, or holding virtual currencies as an investment, generally has tax consequences that could result in tax liability.”

Last week, the agency issued new guidance for crypto taxation which supplements existing guidance published in 2014. The new guidelines answer many questions but also raise many more, especially regarding the tax treatment of coins received from hard forks and airdrops. Anyone receiving “cryptocurrency from an airdrop following a hard fork” will owe income tax “provided you have dominion and control over the cryptocurrency so that you can transfer, sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of the cryptocurrency,” the new guidance details.

The agency also published a draft of the new 1040 tax form used by over 150 million U.S. taxpayers which has a question on cryptocurrency. “At any time during 2019, did you receive, sell, send, exchange, or otherwise acquire any financial interest in any virtual currency?” the first question on Schedule 1 of Form 1040 reads.

Ever since governments worldwide started showing adversity toward cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, a few startups have dedicated their business model to blockchain surveillance. Two weeks ago, Chainalysis revealed the company is monitoring 21 different tokens that stem from Ethereum. On Tuesday, the firm Ciphertrace announced that it’s now tracking 700 cryptocurrencies providing “visibility into 87% of the global trading volume.”

Chainalysis Now Tracks 21 Popular ERC20 Tokens

Blockchain surveillance teams have been ramping up operations in order to appease governments and law enforcement agencies worldwide. On October 3, blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis told the public that the company was now tracking ERC20 tokens like maker (MKR), dai (DAI), and Basic Attention Token (BAT). Chainalysis’ cofounder Jonathan Levin said that regulators and investigators were interested in monitoring these tokens since they started being used in illicit and fraudulent activities. For instance, in September 2017, the ERC20 exchange Etherdelta was hacked for thousands of dollars when a hacker used a malicious code injection attack and drained ERC20 tokens from people’s wallets. Two years later, burglars robbed the trading platform Cryptopia’s ETH and ERC20 tokens stealing more than $16 million.

Chainalysis stressed that lots of businesses have been showing interest in investigating the ERC20 landscape, so the company built ERC20 support in a “matter of weeks.” The firm detailed that over 130 customers in 35 countries use the company’s system to monitor digital currency transactions. The ERC20 support added 21 well known tokens to the Chainalysis framework. By the end of the year, the company says it will be tracking a total of “39 ERC20 tokens in addition to nine other cryptocurrencies — covering 90% of the market by trading volume.” Chainalysis emphasized that the ERC20 support is also available for Chainalysis Reactor, the company’s investigation product.

“[Chainalysis Reactor] is already being used by law enforcement to investigate hacks and other illicit activity across blockchains,” the firm explained in a blog post.

Ciphertrace Combs 700 Blockchains, Accounting for 87% of the Cryptoconomy’s Global Trade Volume

The blockchain surveillance company, Ciphertrace, has also increased its monitoring and the business now tracks 700 different cryptocurrencies. Ciphertrace believes it is one of the world’s “most comprehensive” cryptocurrency intelligence teams out there and the latest update was considered a “giant leap.” Digital assets being monitored include LTC, USDT, BCH, ETH, BTC, and ERC20 tokens as well. “[The infrastructure] provides visibility into 87% of global trading volume with hundreds of millions of attribution data points,” Ciphertrace disclosed. The company’s announcement added:

The Ciphertrace platform maintains the industry’s most accurate pool of attribution data. This includes 522 million attribution data points — such as account type, account holders, contract types, contract owners and other metadata — on cryptocurrency addresses.

Various government agencies worldwide have been utilizing Blockchain forensics for quite some time and the business model has become very profitable. In the U.S. alone, the IRS, DEA, ICE, FBI, and other three-letter agencies continue to hire firms like Chainalysis, Elliptic, and Ciphertrace. All of these crypto surveillance companies believe the software deployed has powerful de-anonymizing capabilities that can help financial institutions and government agents discover illicit behavior. Ciphertrace divulges that the company leverages monitoring schemes like advanced APIs, interactive visualization, a graph database, and pattern recognition in order to de-anonymize digital currency transactions.

Establish appropriate cryptocurrency regulations

On Oct. 16, Beau spoke at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum conference in London, where he discussed the role of cryptocurrency assets in today’s global financial payment system.

Beau stated that the traditional bank-based ecosystem could face significant changes due to the many technological developments, such as blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, explaining:

“With the emergence of so called crypto-assets [...] and so called stablecoins, we may also see new settlement assets develop which may compete against and possibly, according to their promoters, replace commercial and central bank money as settlement assets at the center of our payment systems.”

Beau continues by saying that stablecoins of a potentially large size and reach might present unforeseen challenges of “system-wide importance, to competition policy, financial and monetary stability.”

Beau adds that central banks really only have three available options to address cryptocurrencies.

The first would be to completely ignore crypto assets, which would not mitigate any of the potential risks. The second option would be to ban all cryptocurrencies — and the third available option, which is the most preferred one in Europe and France according to Beau, is to establish and standardize crypto regulations across the board.

The challenge of standardization

Indeed, the lack of standardization of regulations and procedures in the cryptocurrency and blockchain spaces has been identified as a problem both by regulators and industry players. ""Big Four"" professional services firm Deloitte noted the lack of standardization as a major obstacle to blockchain adoption in a report last year.

Monero (XMR) core developer Riccardo Spagni has previously suggested that uneven international regulatory standards will result in a cryptocurrency-related brain drain, as the talent involved in the industry moves to the most beneficial jurisdictions.

Lawmakers in some countries have attempted to get ahead of such an exodus of talent and investment by making friendly regulatory environments within their home jurisdictions.

Earlier this year, United States Representative Warren Davidson reintroduced the Token Taxonomy Act — a bill that would exclude cryptocurrencies from classification under U.S. securities laws.",,https://techround.co.uk/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-to-reach-1-million-and-facebook-to-become-the-worlds-largest-bank-this-is-the-future-of-cryptocurrency/,"Share

Josh anticipates that within the next 20 years Bitcoin will reach $1 Million in value and Facebook could become the world’s biggest bank

One of the leading experts in cryptocurrency and blockchain has predicted that supermarket shoppers will be paying for their weekly shop in cryptocurrency in just 5 years, Bitcoin will reach $1 million in value in the next 20 years and Facebook could become the world’s biggest bank.

Josh Riddett, CEO of Easy Crypto Hunter, the UK’s premier Cryptocurrency and Blockchain experts made the predictions following this week’s Libra Association announcements, the company behind Facebook’s new cryptocurrency.

Josh, who has been involved in cryptocurrency for more than 5 years also predicts that workers in the UK will start to be offered having their salary in cryptocurrency rather than pounds sterling.

Josh explains: “In New Zealand, salary payments are currently being offered in cryptocurrency and it won’t be long till this trend reaches the UK.”

When national supermarket chains in the UK such as Asda, coffee shops such as Starbucks and fast food outlets such as McDonald’s start accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment, which Josh anticipates will be within the next 5-10 years, there will be a demand for salaries to paid in the form of cryptocurrency.

Josh continues: “Lamborghini, some Microsoft stores and Whole Foods, which is owned by Amazon, are already accept cryptocurrency as payment. This is just the start; we will start to see more and more companies accepting cryptocurrency over the next few years. Even today there are contactless cards that exist that will convert your cryptocurrency into sterling so that you can pay for a pint at a bar, just like you can with your bank card.”

Even though the change, that is likely to impact billions of people, is on the horizon, Josh is eager to reassure the public that there is no need to panic, it’s actually something to be excited out moving forward: “It will be a natural progression into paying via cryptocurrency, 20 years ago, paying with cheques and cash was commonplace whereas now contactless payment has taken over. In the next 10 years we will see a similar transition from payment with sterling to payment with cryptocurrency.”

Josh also states that it will have huge benefits, he predicts that there will be no need to worry about the strength the pound or exchange rates when converting currencies for your holiday in the future because cryptocurrencies will be accepted globally.

As it stands today there are 2,000 different forms of cryptographic coins, however, not all of these exist as forms of currency that can be used as payment, some are used for supply chain, insurance and medical data. Josh adds that: “In the next 10 years there will be most likely only ten forms of cryptocurrency that are used as payment, but there is a good chance that all of these coin types will be accepted as forms as payment, just at different rates.

“Bitcoin will be one of these currencies and within the next 20 years the value will most likely reach $1 million per coin. It has started to become traded more regularly as a ‘digital gold’, a trend that will continue moving forward.”

Cryptocurrency expert Josh also anticipates Governments will be looking at cryptocurrency very closely.

With the increase in different methods of Bitcoin trading, such as using a Bitcoin evolution trading robot, the industry is changing and moving into the future at a fast pace.

Josh explains: “In Venezuela, they are trying to rebuild their economy on a cryptocurrency model. In 50 years, a lot of global economies will move to an economy based on a cryptocurrency model, including a digital cryptographic payment system rather than a federal reserve banking system.

“It is something they need to be looking at following the news of Facebook’s new currency, because Libra, the new currency, has potential to be a game changer globally.

“The reason why there has been an uproar is because Governments around the world have no control over traditional cryptocurrency, however, because Facebook is a business, they can influence them and can put pressure on them.

“If the proposed currency goes ahead as planned there is a very good chance that Facebook could become the world’s biggest bank, which is a scary prospect for the current regulators.”

Josh Riddett is the CEO of Easy Crypto Hunter, the UK’s leading GPU mining experts. The mining rigs that Easy Crypto Hunter manufacturer essentially provide power to the blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies and in return collect cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.

The price of bitcoin is up 123% year to date, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Btc) (OTC: GBTC) is up 143.3%.

Bitcoin prices remain down about 33% overall since the beginning of 2018, and bitcoin prices have not made new all-time highs in nearly two years.

Transaction Value Falling

Despite the relatively solid year-to-date returns for the top global cryptocurrency, at least one metric suggests bitcoin usage may not be catching on the way investors had hoped.

The total dollar value of daily bitcoin transactions recently dipped below $1 billion for the first time in about five months, according to Blockchain.com.

Bitcoin transaction volume peaked at over $4.6 billion during the bitcoin bubble in December 2017. That daily transaction value dropped below $1 billion in March of 2018 and mostly stayed below $1 billion throughout 2018 and early 2019.

Transaction value broke above $1 billion in May and stayed above that threshold in the months that followed until finally falling below $1 billion earlier this month.

Silver Lining

The good news for bitcoin investors is that the number of daily transactions has remained relatively elevated, suggesting average transaction sizes are simply becoming smaller.

“What's funny is that the number of transactions hasn't gone down at all and actually remains extremely stable around 3.75 transactions per second,” eToro analyst Mati Greenspan said last week.

After troughing at around two transactions per second back in April, Bitcoin transaction rates have risen to around 3.68 today.

Peak transaction rates during the bitcoin bubble were around 4.77 per second.

Benzinga’s Take

It’s difficult to know for certain why bitcoin transaction sizes appear to be shrinking, but there could be a silver lining to this news.

A 2018 University of Oxford study found that approximately 44% of all bitcoin transactions involved illegal activity, such as money laundering. Oxford estimated criminals make about 36 million annual transactions annually worth about $72 billion.

In other words, criminal bitcoin transactions average about $2,000 per transaction in value.

Assuming the average retail user of bitcoin making purchases or cash transfers is averaging much lower than $2,000 per transaction, the falling average daily transaction value may simply be a reflection of regulatory crackdowns around the world discouraging criminal activity in bitcoin.

From a burst of institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum to new adoption for BTC and Litecoin, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.

Bitcoin and Ethereum

The institutional crypto investment giant Grayscale has released its third-quarter report for 2019, revealing a surge of Wall Street interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Grayscale offers a series of trusts that allow institutions to gain exposure to BTC and a long list of altcoins, including ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, XLM, ZEC and ZEN.

The firm’s latest report shows an exponential jump in growth for BTC and ETH that began early this year.

Grayscale says the biggest surge happened in July, with $75 million pouring into its Bitcoin trust in a single day.

“Quarter billion-dollar inflows ($254.9 million) mark [the] strongest demand for Grayscale products since firm inception: Inflows tripled quarter-over-quarter, from $84.8 to $254.9 million, despite recent declines in digital asset market prices.”

Ripple and XRP

Ripple says MoneyGram CEO W. Alexander Holmes will highlight the impact of digital assets and blockchain technology at the company’s upcoming Swell conference in Singapore.

The two companies partnered in July, with Ripple buying $30 million of shares in MoneyGram at a premium of $4.10 per share.

MoneyGram is implementing Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity solution (previously known as xRapid), which utilizes XRP to power cross-border payments.

In a recent earnings call, Holmes talked about the company’s early experience with XRP.

“I am so excited to announce today that MoneyGram is now live and transacting on the Ripple xRapid platform. We started executing trades earlier this week and all signs point to this being a tremendously beneficial relationship for all parties involved. We are literally settling currencies in seconds, and to quote my friend Larry, ‘This is really cool.’”

Bitcoin and Litecoin

The US-based payment merchant processor Aliant plans to pay its employees part of their compensation packages in both Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Aliant first began supporting crypto payments in September of 2017.

CEO Eric Brown says the initiative shows the company’s commitment to the digital economy.

“The fintech industry is growing and changing rapidly, and this is a way for our employees to be a part of Aliant’s involvement in this shift to digital currency.

Each member of the Aliant team now has a vested interest in cryptocurrency not just as something they work on in the office. The more our team utilizes digital currency, the better our customer user experience will be. This benefits Aliant as a company, and our employees as invested customers.”

Bitcoin sidechains: a nascent market

Data from block explorers confirms that as of Oct. 17, a total of 9,661 BTC ($76.96 million) or a tiny 0.054% of today’s Bitcoin supply resides in three major sidechain projects.

Sidechains are separate blockchains tied to a cryptocurrency’s regular blockchain, i.e. mainchain. Users can interact with it via a pegging mechanism; they send funds to and from the sidechain, with security features ensuring coins are not available on both chains at once.

Sidechains have existed for several years and have various functions depending on developers’ aims.

Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain, or LBTC, for example, focuses on interexchange operability while giving traders enhanced features not yet available on the Bitcoin mainchain.

Binance Chain leads balances

Liquid, which launched in October 2018, currently includes a modest 89 BTC ($709,700). That figure is dwarfed by the largest sidechain, Binance Chain, which has 9,001 BTC ($71.74 million).

Even the Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) sidechain, which is in fact an Ethereum-based ERC-20 standard token, has 571 BTC ($4.55 million) — more than Liquid.

WBTC debuted in January this year, while Binance Chain — cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s in-house project — got its mainnet unveiling in April.

This week, wallet provider Blockchain and digital asset manager CoinShares launched a Bitcoin sidechain of their own in the form of a gold token network.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/alleged-las-vegas-scammer-charged-for-11-million-crypto-binary-options-ponzi/,"Alleged Las Vegas Scammer Charged for $11 Million Crypto Binary Options Ponzi

A Las Vegas man is charged with raising at least $11 million from cryptocurrency investors he promised to trade binary options for, and make gains of up to 300%. According to the charges the money was sent from new clients to previous ones in a classic Ponzi scheme manner.

CFTC Charges Las Vegas Man in $11 Million Fraud

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced it has filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, charging David Gilbert Saffron of Las Vegas as well as his company, Circle Society, Corp., with fraudulent solicitation, misappropriation, and registration violations. The case reportedly involves an $11 million binary options scheme Saffron operated through Circle Society. The court issued an order freezing the assets controlled by Saffron and his company following the filing.

“Digital assets and other 21st century commodities hold great promise for our economy,” stated CFTC Chairman Heath P. Tarbert. “Fraudulent schemes, like that alleged in this case, not only cheat innocent people out of their hard-earned money, but they threaten to undermine the responsible development of these new and innovative markets. America must be a leader in this space, and we will only succeed if these markets have integrity.”

Guaranteed up to 300% Returns

From December 2017 to now, the Las Vegas man and his company raised at least $11 million worth of bitcoin and U.S. dollars from people in the U.S. in order to trade off-exchange binary options on forex and cryptocurrency pairs. According to the complaint, they solicited funds from at least fourteen investors to participate in a pool operated by Circle Society, an entity Saffron created for this purpose, by making false claims about his supposed trading expertise and guaranteeing rates of return up to 300%.

The CFTC found that instead of using the funds to trade in binary options contracts as promised, the assets were misappropriated, including by keeping pool participants’ money in Saffron’s personal cryptocurrency wallet and by using funds to pay other participants, which is a hallmark of a Ponzi scheme. The man and his company are also accused of lying to pool participants in order to conceal their fund’s misappropriation.

The CFTC seeks from the court a full restitution to defrauded investors, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations. However, it warned the alleged victims that restitution orders may not result in full recovery of their lost money because the accused may not have sufficient funds or assets left to pay them in full.

Starting a debate by calling nearly everyone in the room “economically illiterate” doesn’t usually end well for someone attempting to persuade an audience, but that’s just what American economist Nouriel Roubini did on Tuesday, in his debate with Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver. The 40-minute, high-energy volley of arguments and ad homs is as entertaining to watch as it is enlightening.

The Fate of Crypto

The debate, which took place at London’s CC Forum, was an informal style back and forth with loose moderation provided by Eric Van der Kleij, entitled “Will Cryptocurrencies Fail or Succeed?” From the starting gun the discourse takes on a life of its own, with American economist and professor Nouriel Roubini refusing Ver’s offer to receive some free BCH, saying “These are not currencies, so I don’t accept them.” He then notes:

Most people in this space don’t know anything about money, about monetary policy, about banking, about central banking, about finance, about financial institutions. There’s a massive amount of financial illiteracy.

Roubini argues that cryptocurrencies are not true currencies, claiming “bitcoin or any other shit coin” is “absolutely not” a unit of account or means of payment. He cites the relatively small amount of users worldwide and volatile prices. Ver counters what will become Roubini’s mantra throughout the event, that cryptocurrencies have lost most of their value (when looking at peak prices), by producing a ¥10,000 note and detailing the inflation that has already decimated fiat currencies around the globe.

Ver retorts:

This piece of paper in my hand that’s today worth around $90 … used to be worth over $200,000 not all that long ago. How is that a stable store of value?

Roubini rises to the defense of central bankers, claiming “there is low inflation in all advanced economies,” and adding “the idea that central banks are debasing money with high inflation may have been the story for Venezuela or a couple other countries, but it’s not the story for most advanced economies.”

Terrorists, Tax Evaders and Criminals

Things really kick off around the 11:47 mark of the debate video, when Roubini raises his voice and proclaims in southern baptist preacher-like cadence:

No government in the world can allow criminals, terrorists, tax evaders, crooks to move money … without AML and without KYC … you don’t give a shit about them, but they’re gonna crack down on you.

For all his logical flaws throughout the discourse, Roubini does finally manage to ask (or at least to imply) a pertinent question as to how regulation of violent crime could be managed in the context of the financial freedom advocated by Ver, but fails to address Ver’s question about his own personal preference. As the Bitcoin evangelist repeatedly tries to ask Roubini if he personally prefers control over his own funds, and the ability to freely send them, the New York professor shouts him down each time.

Ad Homs and Good Questions

The rest of the debate plays similar, with Roubini falling back on the mantra of bitcoin cash’s loss of value since “the peak” and the presupposition in a room full of crypto users that “nobody uses it.” That notwithstanding, the preponderance of engaging moments and quotable gems makes this debate worth watching all the way through. Ver’s promotion of “a level playing field” for all humans inspires regardless of one’s philosophical biases. Roubini’s uncompromising stance on regulation is thought-provoking.

For all the ad hominem assertions that all of crypto is a shitcoin, and Roubini refusing to yield the floor when he’s hammering a point home, a real highlight occurs during the Q & A period, when a veteran of asset management poses a question. The audience member addresses Roubini, saying:

“Professor, I’m just amazed, having been in the asset management industry for nearly 30 years, the continual lies that I hear from people like you. The $320 billion that so-called safe banks have been fined in the last 10 years because of money laundering … I’m off to California in two days’ time, I’ll go to an ATM. I’ll pull out some U.S. dollars, 90% of which have trace cocaine. Does that make me a money laundering drug dealer?”

After asking why criminals would want to leave a digital footprint and choose crypto over dollars, he goes on to implore the American economist to be a bit more open-minded about the future of finance.

A Thought-Provoking Exchange

The debate ends no less amusingly, the two contenders ramping up the battle in a close-to-the-net series of attempted game-winning spikes, as someone shouts from the audience: “willful ignorance.” The small pandemonium inspires the moderator to call it, and Ver implores sharply over the din of Roubini’s wooden, anti-crypto monologue, “Why are you afraid to try it?” Whatever one’s view of the contenders, or of BCH as a currency, the debate can be seen as a thought-provoking resource for learning why some people may be hesitant to use crypto, and understanding why so many are becoming excited about this new permissionless money that is borderless, decentralized, and censorship-resistant.

The Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) has come a long way since its inception and more than 4,900 SLP tokens have been created to date. During the last few months, SLP usage has grown significantly with people constructing various types of unique ideas that create more use cases for these token concepts.

Close to 5,000 SLP Tokens Created and Dividend Payments

Lots of individuals have been creating SLP tokens on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. Using the SLP explorer Simpleledger.info shows that there’s been 4,922 tokens created and 182,956 SLP transactions. Transactions using the SLP framework have increased a great deal over the last eight months and since August transactions have spiked considerably. Some of the most popular tokens being used today include the Tribeos Token Test #3, Spice, Bread, Honk Honk, SLP Official, Dogecash, ACD, Honestcoin, and Realmx.

Additionally, there’s been roughly 4,121 SLP-based token burns since the project started. The most popular SLP token designed by Tribeos is a trial token for the firm’s security token offering (STO). Tribeos founder Matt Gallant told news.Bitcoin.com in March that the Tribeos STO was approved by the Bermuda Minister of Finance under new digital asset laws. According to Electron Cash developer Jonald Fyookball and Gallant at the time, the official Tribeos token will be called FIRE.

Another popular platform that leverages the SLP framework is Bitcoin.com’s dividend payment tool and BCH proponents have been using the product regularly. For instance, SLP-centric exchange Cryptophyl has been airdropping tokens to registered traders and just recently the platform airdropped 2.1 million Spice using onchain dividends. Rhett Creighton, the creator of zclassic and bitcoin private, also established an SLP token for his group #800cc. Creighton recently gave away $20,000 in crypto in order to spread more adoption and created an #800cc SLP distribution concept using onchain dividend payments. On Wednesday, Creighton showed his excitement for Bitcoin.com’s dividend payment tool and said:

Wow — If I paste this into a Bitcoin.com wallet, it gives me a transaction to send 1 BCH split between all #800cc members with only 1 3-cent fee. Who is ready for magic?

SLP Token Universe Continues to Show Innovation

On forums and social media, BCH proponents discussed the current SLP trend and showed appreciation for the onchain dividend payment concept. One person remarked “It’s the dividends that really make this a game-changer — One could create a token that tracks eg. Exxon stock and when Exxon pays a dividend you get that in BCH. That’s custodial obviously but imagine having your entire PA stock portfolio in non-confiscatable borderless crypto?” “Coinex should move CET to SLP and pay dividends directly,” he added. Another SLP-related website launched this week called Pulse Monster shows a price index of a few popular SLP tokens like Spice, Drop, and Sai. Alternatively, individuals can visit the markets.Bitcoin.com token section for a price index on SLP tokens like ACD, Spice, and Honestcoin (USDH).

In addition to the traditional type 1 SLP tokens, people have been creating nonfungible tokens that can be grouped by a single ID. Since the release of the nonfungible token concept called NFT1 and the Simple Ledger Protocol virtual hackathon, people have been creating digitized assets and collectibles. The sandbox game built on top of the BCH chain Realmx uses SLP tokens for in-game items and weapons. For instance, there’s the Realmx Diamond Token, which has seen over 500 transactions since the coin’s inception. Moreover, all 4,900 SLP tokens in existence can be easily stored on one of many noncustodial clients like Ifwallet, Crescent Cash, Badger, Electron Cash, Honeypoints, and Memo’s native wallet. As the future of the SLP universe continues to blossom, the innovative concepts tied to the protocol should help cushion the value and utility of bitcoin cash.

But that, at this point, crypto faces a variety of constraints, Moody’s said, including scalability, security and the reliability of the technology, along with possible regulatory action if digital currencies gain traction.

“Over time, the rising prevalence of digital currencies will shape the development of digital platforms by companies in many different sectors. But for now, the scalability, security and reliability of these currencies are key constraints to their widespread adoption,” Moody’s said.

Given these limitations, Moody’s said that cryptocurrencies are “unlikely to displace official currencies as a medium of exchange.”

“We are focused on providing the best services, tools, and capabilities available to meet the accounting and verification needs surrounding cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets.”

According to Canty, strategic funds will be earmarked primarily for sales and marketing for the Ledgible platform.

Canty and co-founder Nathan Eppinger used their strong blockchain backgrounds to pinpoint a need for a cryptocurrency accounting tool while conducting an audit for an accounting firm with bitcoin assets. They founded Verady to commercialize the Ledgible accounting platform.

“We provide a ‘bank statement for blockchain’ capability and the tools to report and seamlessly integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional finance and accounting systems,” says Canty.

Miami based bitcoin ATM maker Bitstop has recently installed Miami International Airport’s first crypto ATM, according to a press release issued October 15. The installation adds to the 106 machines the company has already placed across the U.S. Further, it raises important questions about the benefits and legality of traveling with crypto in lieu of cash, when it comes to declaration of assets.

Traveling Privately With Crypto

While the installation of another crypto ATM doesn’t exactly herald groundbreaking change in the crypto space, per se, Bitstop’s new ATM in Miami International Airport’s concourse G does merit some attention. First, though Bitstop advertises the user experience as “private,” travelers must first register with the company using a valid “ID or mobile device.” Given the current regulatory climate in the space, it seems that the days of legal, non-ID ATMs may soon be a thing of the past. Though there are still some ATMs allowing for non-ID purchase, regulatory bodies worldwide are taking unified steps to better track the flow of digital assets.

Second, travelers have been talking for a while now about the process of declaring declaring crypto holdings when passing through customs. Owing to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), countries have hard rules on the amounts of fiat cash, gold or other assets travelers can bring across their borders without an official declaration. With crypto, though, it’s not so cut and dried.

Though a bill was submitted by the U.S. Senate in 2017 which would require travelers to declare digital currencies over $10,000 if made law, it has still to make its way to the customs declaration cards familiar to travelers. The bill reads in part:

Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall submit to Congress a report detailing a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments, at border crossings and other ports of entry for the United States.

Though the latest iteration of the bill has yet to pass Senate, the reality of newly implemented decryption laws, in places like Australia, has some wondering when these practices might become more commonplace. According to a local media outlet, the accused in such cases “who refuse to provide access to a device face dramatic­ally increased penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment as a result of the laws, passed in December. Previously, the penalty was up to two years’ imprisonment.”

Bitstop Co-Founder Cites Security and Convenience

Bitstop’s co-founder Doug Carrillo relates in the press release: “More and more people prefer to travel with Bitcoin instead of cash for convenience and security. Miami International Airport is a perfect place for our customers to conveniently exchange their dollars for Bitcoin and vice versa when traveling domestically or abroad.”

Carrillo’s proclamation raises even more questions about the possibility of travelers converting funds en route so as to avoid the necessity of declaration at their destination. Thanks to ID requirements, however, tracing such transactions would prove easy for law enforcement should legislation prohibiting such actions be passed.

Bitstop’s 107 bitcoin ATMs nationwide deal in BTC, and require extensive user identification. For some this is still a convenient and viable option. For others who prefer to acquire crypto in a less privacy-invasive manner, trading platforms like local.bitcoin.com exist, facilitating peer-to-peer trade of bitcoin cash (BCH) with multiple payment options and utilizing an end-to-end encrypted escrow system.

Second generation blockchains were presented as being faster, cheaper, and more scalable than Bitcoin. Third generation chains (basically anything that came after Ethereum) promised even greater optimizations. In the event, these networks have run into the same difficulties as Bitcoin, with competition for scarce resources leading to mounting costs and congestion. To tackle these problems, an array of scaling solutions has been proffered – some of which could also benefit UTXO blockchains such as BCH and BTC.

At the annual Ethereum developers’ conference in Osaka last week, most of the talks were about scaling. So was a good chunk of the informal talk between delegates, many of whom have grave concerns about Ethereum’s ability to meet growing network demand. Eth 2.0, the much-vaunted upgrade that will involve a transition from PoW to PoS, is still years away, with many Devcon attendees conceding that it may never happen. This impasse has prompted rival smart contract chains such as Qtum to position themselves as more scalable alternatives.

Over on EOS, there are similar problems stacking up. Unlike Ethereum, EOS isn’t really gunning for the decentralized finance crown, but it does share one thing in common: growing demand for finite resources. On Ethereum, those resources manifest as block space which pushes up gas prices. On EOS, it takes the form of computational resources: RAM (virtual storage) and CPU, which is the amount of time a block producer will allocate to transactions from a particular account.

Rising and erratic computational costs on EOS have forced developers to seek scaling solutions of their own. The architecture of blockchains such as Bitcoin, EOS, and Ethereum differs substantially, but this much holds true: onchain resources are limited and there is an open market competing for space. Just as your car moves more slowly and is less fuel efficient during rush hour, at peak times on crypto networks, your transaction is likely to be slower and more expensive. Fixing this problem calls for some out the blocks thinking.

Virtual CPU and Offchain Transactions

For EOS, scaling salvation has come courtesy of Liquidapps, whose vRAM product has now been complemented by a vCPU counterpart. This approach involves taking these precious resources off-chain to a separate network of nodes that perform the computation at low cost, before broadcasting the verification to the EOS main chain. Although currently being provisioned on EOS, the same technology can be applied to Ethereum, or even to Bitcoin Cash, for developers seeking to create decentralized applications that require access to cheap storage.

For Ethereum, the scaling solution presented as the likeliest to succeed is Plasma, which can handle hundreds of transactions per second, and now supports smart contracts. As co-founder Jinglan Wang puts it, defi projects saying they don’t need Ethereum scaling solutions right now is like a New Yorker saying they don’t need a Metrocard in rush hour. Plasma is a layer two solution, whose BTC analogue is Lightning Network.

Dapp Developers Must Choose Wisely

Developers pondering the best network on which to launch decentralized applications have some tough choices.

Ethereum has a large ecosystem of users, devs, and companies, but it’s running near capacity, and network fees have been rising for months. Scaling solutions such as Matic can help.

EOS provides free transactions at the point of access, making it more consumer-friendly, but popular dapps risk landing their developers with rising computational costs. Secondary solutions such as vRAM can mitigate this however.

Qtum has just undergone its first hard fork, adding a new EVM that’s enhanced its smart contract capabilities, while retaining the UTXO model first pioneered on Bitcoin. It’s basically Ethereum without the scaling problems, albeit with a smaller ecosystem at this point in time.

Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

Taking transactions offchain, be it to a sidechain or layer two, is not without compromises. Generally speaking, there is a reduction in decentralization and in transaction finality. The architects of these solutions stress that a micropayment doesn’t need the same level of security and trustlessness as a $1 billion BTC transaction. Gaming and gambling dapps, for instance, are fine to use a product like Liquidapps’ vRAM for offchain storage, or Plasma for low-cost transactions.

To return to the traffic analogy, side streets can be used to skirt the traffic snarling up the freeway, but they’re not designed to support 16-wheelers. Blockchain scaling solutions can therefore be more accurately described as scaling options: choices that will be suitable for some projects, and unacceptable to others.

Vertical scaling is the process of increasing throughput by increasing block or node capacity. It’s the approach taken by Bitcoin Cash, for instance. The solution to Bitcoin blocks becoming full, its proponents argue, is simply to add a couple more lanes to the highway. It’s a simple approach, but one that has proven very effective so far. Horizontal scaling entails taking as much of the load off the main chain as possible, pushing it out to third party solutions that add extensibility.

Despite the millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours poured into blockchain scaling, the truth is, we still don’t know which solutions will prevail. Bigger blocks; more sidechains; building up the stack; developing horizontally. Through trial and error, discourse and debate, a path will be found to make blockchains ready for the mass adoption that all crypto advocates see as inevitable. In the here and now, though, the architects of so-called next-generation blockchains are learning a lesson that bitcoiners learned long ago: onchain, there’s no such thing as infinite scalability.

Bitcoin’s 50- and 200-day moving averages (MAs)look set to produce a death cross in the next week or two. Historical data shows the cryptocurrency could bottom out if the cross is confirmed.

BTC may drop to support near $7,430 before then.

A break above $8,820 is needed to invalidate the bearish lower-highs set up and confirm a bullish reversal.

Bitcoin may be close to bottoming out, as a popular contrary indicator is teasing a bearish turn for the first time since March 2018.

Potentially producing a so-called death cross, the 50-day moving average is falling fast and may drop below the 200-day MA over the next week or so. If confirmed, the chart event would be the first such crossover of these averages since March of last year.

A death cross is a long-term bear market indicator, according to technical analysis theory. In reality, however, it is a lagging indicator and often ends up trapping sellers on the wrong side of the market, as seen in the charts below.

The 50-day MA fell below the 200-day MA on March 31, 2018 (above left), following which the sell-off stalled around $6,500 and the cryptocurrency rose back to highs near $10,000 in the first week of May.

Note that the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions when the crossover happened.

A market is often oversold by the time a cross is confirmed, as the MAs are based on past data and the crossovers are a product of price rallies or sell-offs.

In mid-September, 2015, bitcoin’s pullback from highs near $250 also ran out of steam near $220 with the confirmation of a death cross.

The cryptocurrency remained sidelined in the range of $220–$250 in the following weeks before breaking into a bull market at the end of October 2015. What followed was a meteoric rise to a record high of $20,000 by December 2017.

The impending crossover may also turn out to be a bear trap, as bitcoin will most likely be oversold by then, having dropped more than 40 percent already from June’s high of $13,800.

Additionally, the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020 and may repeat history by picking up a strong bid six months ahead of the event, as pointed out by popular analyst @100trillionUSD.

That said, the ongoing pullback from the recent highs above $8,800 looks to have legs, as per the technical charts. Therefore, bitcoin will likely remain on the defensive in the days leading up to the crossover and bottom-out below recent lows near $7,750.

The spread between the 50- and 200-day MAs currently stands at $417 – the narrowest since early May – and indicates that bullish sentiment is at its weakest in over five months.

Daily, 6-hour and weekly chart

Bitcoin bounced up from the 100-week moving average last week and witnessed a double bottom breakout on the 6-hour chart (above left).

Even so, the cryptocurrency failed to take out the 200-day MA on Oct.11 (above right) and has dropped to levels below $8,000, forming a bearish lower high pattern above $8,800.

Put simply, the bearish sentiment is still quite strong and a deeper slide below the 100-week moving average at $7,755, possibly to support near $7,430 (multiple daily lows in early June) could be in the offing ahead of the death cross confirmation.

The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above $8,820, invalidating the bearish lower highs setup.

The banks and electronic payment companies that will distribute the new digital currency already require users to authenticate their names and identities. And officials have made clear that the central bank will be able to view data on transactions.

Chinese consumers have for years paid for everything with their phones, and the country’s two dominant mobile payment services, Alipay and WeChat Pay, have become pillars of the Chinese economy. Alipay says it has processed as many as 256,000 payments per second. By comparison, Visa says it can handle 65,000. Libra is promising to do 1,000, at least at the start.

But many transactions on the Chinese platforms move exclusively between digital wallets, never making contact with the state-dominated banking system. That means the Chinese government has to go through the platforms’ privately owned parent companies, Ant Financial and Tencent, if it wants to track and scrutinize those movements.

Not so with the new e-currency.

“This is highly controlled, manageable and decided by the central government,” said Gary Liu, an economist in Shanghai. “This is very different from the original concept of a cybercurrency.”

Chinese officials use something of an oxymoron to describe what their new currency will offer: “controllable anonymity.”

“As long as you aren’t committing any crimes and you want to make purchases that you don’t want others to know about, we still want to protect this kind of privacy,” Mr. Mu, the deputy director of the central bank’s payments department, said in another recent online lecture on China’s cryptocurrency plans.

Clamping down on the true anonymity that paper money allows could bring real benefits in a country where corruption and fraud are widespread. But the government also risks alienating people in China who have grown increasingly sensitive to how their personal data is collected and used.",2019-10-18,https://www.coindesk.com/kik-sells-messaging-app-reaffirms-kin-crypto-integration,"The Kik messaging platform has been bought by MediaLab, a holding company which operates Whisper and a number of other apps, the company announced Friday.

Kik Interactive, the company behind the messaging platform, previously announced that it would be shutting the app down in October, though CEO Ted Livingston announced last week that a company had signed a letter of intent to purchase the app. Details of the sale were not disclosed.

“We believe that Kik’s best days remain ahead of it,” the blog post read. While MediaLab plans to commit to Kik long-term, the company is looking to raise revenue through the messaging app, and will integrate ads on the platform as a short-term effort to do so. (Livingston has previously pushed back against the idea of enabling ads on the platform.)

Kik Interactive, the company behind the messaging platform, is currently embroiled in a legal fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged Kik violated securities law when it raised $100 million in a token sale in late 2017. Livingston vowed to fight the SEC, but announced in late September that Kik would be shutting down the messaging app portion of its business. Livingston directly attributed this shutdown to the SEC fight in a blog post at the time.

Livingston did pledge that the company would continue to build out the Kin ecosystem, referring to the cryptocurrency Kik built as part of the token sale process.

In Friday’s blog post, MediaLab said the messaging app would continue to enable kin transactions, writing:

“We are fans of Kin and believe in its long term potential. We are excited to further partner with Ted and his team on expanding the Kin integration and have plans to further support the project. We’ll have more to share on that front soon.”

Going forward, MediaLab plans to improve the app, reduce the number of bugs, and solicit feedback from the app’s users to determine what features they want or issues they have.

“Ted Livingston and the rest of the team at Kik have spent the last 9 years building something truly special,” the announcement read. “At the risk of sounding cheesy we are still passionate believers in what the internet promised to bring in its early days – a connected and shared experience amongst people regardless of geography or time zone. Kik is one of those amazing places that brings us back to those early aspirations.”

Circle first acquired the crypto exchange back in February 2018, around peak interest in the crypto market. Does the company switching gears signal that interest has left the crypto market? Or are there additional implications for the US-based company around the regulation potentially coming to the space?

Poloniex to ‘Spin-Out’ Into Own Independent International Crypto Brand

Back in February 2018, before the bear market and dreaded crypto winter got fully underway, Goldman Sachs-backed finance firm Circle, acquired cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex for $400 million. Even major finance brands were FOMOing into the emerging market.

Circle failed to elevate the status of the crypto platform, and it fell far behind Coinbase, Binance, and other industry leaders, prompting Circle to “spin out” the crypto platform into its own independent firm, called Polo Digital Assets, Ltd.

Circle says that they faced “challenges as a US company growing a competitive international exchange,” but didn’t disclose what those challenges may be, however, the exchange taking a stance similar to Binance by barring US-based investors could be evidence of something more going on behind the scenes.

Backed by an “Asian investment group,” the new Poloniex will close trading to US crypto investors as of November 1st, potentially signaling that pressure from financial regulators in the United States may have prompted Circle to dump Poloniex.

If you’ve got a few thousand satoshis burning a hole in your wallet, the darknet beckons. There’s no obligation to spend a single sat while scouring the darker recesses of the web, but it’s nice to know that should you get the urge, your crypto’s good. There are few certainties when shopping on darknet markets (DNMs), but acceptance of BTC, XMR, and other leading cryptos is a given. Here’s a snapshot of what the current crop of darknet markets has to offer.

Sliding Into the DNMs

Although darknet markets are under increased threat from law enforcement, business continues to boom. Every time a darknet market is taken down, a new head of the Hydra springs up in its place. Dark.fail lists around 20 DNMs, as well as forums and other darknet resources. A cornucopia of forbidden pleasures is but a Tor connection away, but as with all endeavors that involve dabbling in gray or black markets, discretion is advised. Intrepid bitcoiners eager to indulge in a little retail therapy can boot up their browser and mosey down any of the following bazaars.

Empire Market

Reliance on any single DNM is unwise, as you never know when a site might be busted, backdoored, DDoSed into oblivion, or head for the exits. That said, at this point in time, Empire is the DNM leader by some distance. It’s got almost 40,000 listings for drugs alone and has a thriving ecosystem of vendors and customers who congregate on darknet forums like Dread. Empire’s a little over a year old, but you wouldn’t think it to look at the size of the place. Its subdread board of over 8,000 users vastly exceeds that of any other DNM. If there’s one criticism of Empire, it’s that it’s often offline. That’s the trouble with being the king: everyone wants to topple you.

Grey Market

Grey Market is one of the newer DNMs, making its online debut in mid-2019. Despite its youth, it already boasts over 450 vendors and some 4,700 products, from cannabis vape oil to goods aimed at those with a stronger constitution. As a wallet-less market, there’s no need to deposit funds before you can shop. For every order, you dispatch coins from a wallet you already control to a newly generated address. In theory, this ensures better security for users. Grey Market accepts BTC and XMR and has a 10-tier EXP (experience) structure for vendors.

Cannazon

Cannazon’s logo gives a good indication of the sort of products it offers, with kush lovers well catered for. Like Grey Market, the accepted currencies here are BTC and XMR and there’s a multisig escrow system which is standard with DNMs. Cannazon has been operating since mid-2016, which is practically forever in the world of darknet markets. One good thing about Cannazon is that they vet vendors pretty hard to ensure a high level of product and service and there are 15 vendor tiers. Unlike Grey Market, Cannazon will not ship to or from the U.S.

Cryptonia

Cryptonia cares about security. That’s why, as soon as you alight on the site, you’re bludgeoned with reassurances: “Cryptonia features the most secure 2/3 Bitcoin Multisig implementation of any market, a transparent wallet-less escrow system” and so forth. XMR and BTC are the accepted cryptocurrencies, and though the UX isn’t a strong point, the thousands of product listings more than compensate.

Tochka

Whatever your poison, you’ll find it on Tochka. This DNM, which has been operating since 2014, offers a seven-day escrow system and two-of-three multisig. BTC, XMR, and LTC are the favored currencies. Over 6,800 products are on sale at the time of writing, from just under 600 vendors: everything from seeds and edibles to viagra and growth hormone. Interestingly, Tochka has joined forced with DNMAvengers, a forum dedicated to reducing harm and spreading awareness via testing of products suspected of containing adulterants. What’s more, the site allows dead drops, should customers wish to subtly pick up their wares from a prearranged location.

Apollon

With over 10,000 listings for drugs alone, Apollon can’t be accused of scrimping on choice. It accepts a good selection of cryptocurrencies too: bitcoin cash as well as BTC, XMR, and LTC. It’s a traditional direct deposit market, so you need to fund your wallet address and wait for the deposit to clear before you can order. There’s nothing novel about Apollon, but that’s okay. The mere existence of multiple DNMs, no matter how generic, lessens the likelihood of them all becoming unavailable at once.

Needless to say, if you do decide to avail yourself of any of the aforementioned darknet markets – or any others not included in this list – keep your opsec on point and exercise caution at every pass.

On October 16, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) announced multi-currency support and integration with 15 platforms and wallets. The fusion will provide users with the ability to use a single ENS name across a wide spectrum of crypto applications alongside leveraging a variety of digital assets.

15 Wallets and Platforms Pledge to Support the Ethereum Name Service

Anyone who has used a cryptocurrency like bitcoin cash (BCH) or ethereum (ETH) knows that long alphanumeric addresses can be awkward, especially to newcomers. The Ethereum Name Service attempts to solve this issue by providing a decentralized method of using simple, human-readable names. So users who use ENS don’t have to rely on long addresses and anyone can use names like “alice.mywallet.eth.” In order to send ‘Alice’ funds, you simply use the ENS name with a compatible wallet.

ENS is already supported by well known platforms such as Opera Touch, Pandax, Cipher, Myetherwallet, Metamask, and Argent. On Wednesday, ENS detailed that 15 more wallets and applications will be supporting the ENS infrastructure. With a total of 24 platforms, multi-coin support will be available as well for a large number of digital assets. ENS representative Brantly Millegan said that the first version of multi-currency support will integrate with ETC, ETH, BTC, and LTC. However, the manager UI will be expanded for other assets like bitcoin cash (BCH).

The 15 new additions implementing ENS support include the Bitcoin.com Wallet, Atomic Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Opera, Imtoken, Dcent, Trustwallet, Portis, Haven, Squarelink, and Coin Request. Apart from the new client support, ENS is going beyond .ETH namespace names Millegan noted. “We still plan on expanding the namespace available for use on ENS by integrating the DNS namespace. For example, the Ethereum Foundation owns the DNS name “ethereum.org”; with our system, they could also have an ENS record for “ethereum.org” (notethereum.eth, which is a separate name). In this way, the Ethereum Foundation could use “ethereum.org” both for their normal website (using DNS) and for receiving cryptocurrency payments (using ENS).” Millegan added:

This already works for .XYZ names, as well as in a special way for names on .LUXE, .KRED, and .ART. And soon we will be rolling out this functionality to all DNSSEC-enabled DNS TLDs, which includes all the major ones.

Infrastructure and Governance for the Distributed Web

With multi-coin progression and the integration with major DNS namespace names, the ENS team believes the project is key in creating a powerful decentralized web. Millegan stressed that ENS and IPFS are accessible in Opera and the Metamask extension. He further highlighted that Ethdns with .LINK can be an answer to the Tor .onion address naming problem. “Support for voluntary personal Whois data has a project underway for serving traditional DNS records,” Millegan said.

The nonprofit hopes the project will bolster a censorship-resistant system for the internet’s name system. Further multiple wallets pledging to support ENS will help spread human-readable addresses as well. The team behind ENS thinks that with all the prior crypto-namespace attempts in the past with projects like Namecoin, “ENS operates in a distributed fashion for both its infrastructure and governance.” Other wallets and platform developers can integrate ENS support as resources are available like the EIP for ENS multi-coin support and the Github repository. Check out the Devcon5 video demo below showing off multi-coin support for ENS at the event in Osaka, Japan.

The cryptocurrency exchange first announced its futures platform in early July, at the time hinting it would allow 20x leverage. Now, futures traders can now choose leveraged positions between 1x and 125x, it said Friday.

“We have seen an increase in institutional participation in trading … And they are flocking to Binance Futures,” said Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao in a statement. “The market has been demanding a product with superior stability and performance; now we are providing one.”

Max leverage positions on Binance now exceed crypto exchange BitMEX’s futures leverage positions, which top off at 100x for some contracts.

Noted economist and crypto skeptic Nouriel Roubini has previously argued that, in providing such high leverage, exchanges are exposing traders to too much risk.

Binance said its BTC futures contract provides a built-in hedging tool to help traders manage that risk. Further, the exchange said it’s providing an “insurance fund” (the firm’s quotation marks) that “helps to limit the chances of auto-deleverage.”

The announcement comes amidst tightening competition in the bitcoin futures space. Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt bitcoin futures exchange launched this September. Although the exchange’s initial volume disappointed critics, the exchange has already conducted its first block trade for two institutional investors.

According to a blog post published by Circle, the cryptocurrency firm is releasing its subsidiary exchange Poloniex which is now owned by an “Asian investment group.” The trading platform will become an independent company called Polo Digital Assets, Ltd., and after November 1, 2019, U.S. residents will no longer be able to use the platform.

Circle Spins Out Poloniex

Circle, which specializes in digital assets and over-the-counter swaps, has decided to sell the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex. The terms of the deal are unknown, but Circle paid roughly $400 million for the trading platform in February 2018. In a message to the public, Circle cofounders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire disclosed that the exchange will be its own entity known as Polo Digital Assets, Ltd., and it is now backed by an investment agency located in Asia. Circle’s blog post disclosed that Poloniex will be performing “aggressive hiring” and the new entity will spend $100 million on operations management. On October 21, Polo is offering 0% trading fees until the end of the year but U.S. customers received some bad news.

“This transition will mean some significant changes for existing U.S. customers of Poloniex,” Circle’s blog post underlines. “As detailed in a separate announcement from the Poloniex team, U.S. customers will no longer be able to trade on the exchange starting on November 1, 2019.” Neville and Allaire’s announcement further details:

U.S. customers will continue to be able to access and use their wallets and withdraw funds through wallet and custody services operated by Circle until at least December 15, 2019.

US Regulations Stifle Digital Currency Businesses

The cofounders mentioned that it was “bittersweet” for the company to release the firm, but also highlighted that Circle “faced challenges as a U.S. company growing a competitive international exchange.” On social media and forums, U.S. residents were flabbergasted by Circle’s announcement. One person wrote that he was “getting really sick of losing access to crypto markets due to being a U.S. citizen.” “Someone needs to put up an easy how-to guide on how to set up an offshore corporation U.S. citizens can put their assets into, and then how to use a VPN to access exchanges,” the individual continued on the Reddit forum r/cryptocurrency.

Additionally, the cryptocurrency community discussed the Asian investment group that allegedly purchased Poloniex. Celia Wan and Frank Chaparro from The Block assert “Tron founder Justin Sun is behind Poloniex’s spin-off.” The founder of Digibyte, Jared Tate, remarked that it was “sad to see Poloniex is kicking all U.S. customers off their platform.” Tate added:

One major step backward for crypto in the USA.

U.S. residents have been at a loss when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges that offer a large assortment of digital currencies. Recently Binance shut down operations in the U.S. for a while and when it returned, the number of tradeable coins was far less. Bitfinex explained that it would “be discontinuing services to our existing U.S. individual customers” in 2017. Last summer Bittrex banned 32 cryptocurrencies from American citizens including QTUM, STORJ, and BCTP.

Poloniex is moving out of the US to focus on international markets. They won’t even let US customers use their products moving forward. This will become the norm if the US continues to create an overbearing and/or uncertain regulatory environment. We must get it right. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) October 18, 2019

Since 2017, interest in cryptocurrencies has surged and many U.S. states have implemented regulations toward digital currency trading platforms and money transmitters. There are certain states in the U.S. exchanges won’t go near like New York due to the strict Bitlicense guidelines. New York’s measure of regulations and guidelines consists of a 44-page document and lots of upfront fees. When the Bitlicense was enacted into law, cryptocurrency startups like Shapeshift, Poloniex, and Xapo left the state and never returned.

The Taiwanese smartphone maker on Saturday launched the Exodus 1s, a slightly smaller take on the Exodus 1, which it released last year. That phone initially cost 0.15 bitcoins — over $1,189 at current prices, similar to that of a high-end iPhone or Galaxy — although the company subsequently let people buy it in dollars for $699.

This new device costs 219 euros ($244), or the equivalent in cryptocurrency. But the big difference with this handset, according to HTC's Phil Chen, is that it comes packed with cryptocurrency-related features that will let users exchange, lend and borrow digital assets. He added that the first phone met the firm's own sales targets.

""This is a completely different device,"" Chen, who serves as HTC's ""decentralized chief officer,"" told CNBC. ""The Exodus 1 is still available and is hitting our internal targets. We've been delighted with the response.""

One standout feature on the new phone, HTC says, is the ability to run a ""full bitcoin node."" Buyers would have to fork out for a 400GB memory card that stores the bitcoin blockchain — a digital ledger used to validate transactions — on the phone. This basically means that users will be able to verify transactions on the underlying bitcoin network.

Chen explained this would enable cryptocurrency wallets on the phone to ""calculate the user's balance and ensure that future transactions are verified, further ensuring that the balance is actually owned by the spender.""",2019-10-19,https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-blocks-2-crypto-news-websites/,"Russia Blocks 2 Crypto News Websites

Russian authorities have restricted access to a couple of cryptocurrency news outlets. The formal reasons for the censorship move are different in each case but the end result is the same. In both, regulators have acted on the basis of a law that empowers them to block online sources of information that have been banned in the Russian Federation.

Moscow Restricts Access to Cointelegraph and Coinspot

The restrictive measures have been imposed against Cointelegraph, a global information source about the latest developments in the crypto space, and Coinspot, a Russian language portal spreading news and other useful information about decentralized digital currencies, fintech trends and financial innovations. Both have been blocked for readers in Russia, starting from October 16.

The formal reason in the case with Cointelegraph is a request from Russia’s Federal Tax Service filed on Dec. 25, 2017. The outlet explained that although Cointelegraph was blacklisted almost two years ago, the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media (Roskomnadzor) technically implemented the ban only this week. It remains unclear why it took the watchdog so long to act.

Cointelegraph quoted the developer of a Russian anticensorship browser extension who, on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the block, noting that the website’s URL has been added to the blacklist file Roskomnadzor emails to internet service providers. However, it seems not all of them have updated their databases at this point as the website is still available to some users in the country.

The other affected news outlet, Coinspot, has been blocked at the request of the Prosecutor’s Office of Danilovsky District in Volgograd region, Forklog reported. According to an August 22 ruling by the Central District Court of Volgograd, only a single article detailing how to find a blockchain casino had to be taken down. However, most Russian internet providers have restricted access to the whole site.

In both cases, Roskomnadzor’s decisions are based on the Law “On information, information technology and information protection,” which went into force in July, 2006. Its provisions are typically used to justify the blocking of websites containing information the dissemination of which in the Russian Federation has been prohibited for various reasons.

Sarkis Darbinyan, lead legal expert at Roskomsvoboda, confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com his organization is aware of these developments. The NGO, which is fighting internet censorship in the country, is currently trying to gather more details about the blocking of the websites.

Government Internet Censorship Intensifies

The Russian telecom regulator has in the past taken actions against other web portals related to cryptocurrencies, usually on request from other government institutions and the judiciary. For example, the supervisory service blocked the online exchanger Buybit.net in April of this year. But there have been also cases where such attempts have failed.

In May, Roskomnadzor had to take a similar platform, removing Bestchange.ru from its blacklist after prosecutors gave up efforts to block the website citing pending legislation expected to regulate digital assets. In March 2018, the Saint Petersburg City Court struck down a ban on 40 websites offering information and services related to cryptocurrencies, and in April, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to block the Bitcoininfo.ru portal.

Despite these positive developments, the government has been tightening the noose on the Russian segment of the internet. In March, Roskomnadzor demanded that 10 VPN service providers connect to the Federal State Information System, the register that keeps information about all websites that have been banned in Russia.

Later, in April, the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, adopted a law designed to channel Russian internet traffic through routing points controlled by authorities in Moscow and effectively isolate the Russian internet space (Runet) from the rest of the web in the future. It grants Roskomnadzor powers to go after internet providers that refuse to participate in Russia’s version of the Great Firewall.

Depending on who you ask, Brexit will affect every aspect of British life. But how will the UK leaving the EU affect the bitcoin market? And in particular, how will it affect the BTC/GBP market? (Updated at 15:21 UTC: updates in bold.)

Well, the answers to these questions depend largely on whether or not the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal on October 31. If it does, it's likely that the value of the British pound will decline significantly on currency markets. Will the Brits and other holders of GBP flock towards bitcoin as a safer haven? No one knows, as bitcoin still lacks strong proofs that it might act as a hedge, especially in developed markets.

However, if a deal is approved by the UK parliament at the eleventh hour, then it's equally likely that sterling could rally. As such, there will be even less impetus for traders to convert their pounds to bitcoin, and less of a speculative 'Brexit bounce' for crypto more generally.

No-Deal Brexit

""A no-deal Brexit would shake confidence in the pound and send investors into a panicky search for safe-haven assets,"" explains cryptocurrency expert and author Glen Goodman, speaking to Cryptonews.com.

To learn more on how to store your bitcoins safely, visit our guide on that subject or use Luno Bitcoin Wallet.

As of writing, the UK government has secured a new withdrawal agreement with the EU, but the chances of a no-deal Brexit are still high. British lawmakers on Saturday voted for a proposal to withhold support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal until formal ratification legislation has passed, a step that will oblige him to ask the European Union for a Brexit delay for three months, Reuters reported.

In either case, markets reacted to the new agreement positively and GBP rallied against USD, reaching the level last seen in May 2019.

However, Goodman explains that the U.S. dollar would most likely be the major beneficiary of any panic caused by a no-deal Brexit. Still, gold and bitcoin would also likely witness price gains in the event of a GBP dive.

""For investors, the problem with no-deal is it makes the future for Britain much more uncertain, and of course markets hate uncertainty,"" Goodman adds.

""This doesn't mean nobody will want to invest in the UK anymore, but it does mean that investors will be looking to hedge their sterling risk with non-correlated assets such as Bitcoin, because it's an asset that doesn't depend on the future of the British economy.""

________

Other analysts and experts are in agreement with Goodman on this. CommerceBlock CEO Nicholas Gregory said in August, ""Bitcoin has rediscovered its mojo this year with multiple mini surges but a no-deal Brexit could see a massive and unprecedented breakout.""

Importantly, Gregory points out that a no-deal Brexit would likely impact confidence in the euro as well as the pound, meaning that the bitcoin market would witness increased demand from two separate sources.

""Not only will a no-deal departure from the EU create turmoil and volatility across two major fiat currencies, it will also trigger an identity crisis for the global system as the contingency and vulnerability of major global fiat currencies is laid bare.”

Identity Crisis

This last point is important, because aside from increasing short-term demand for bitcoin, a no-deal (or badly managed) Brexit would likely have the longer term impact of weakening public faith in fiat currencies, which are strongly associated with the fortunes of national governments and economies.

And in concert with inflationary monetary policy in general, Glen Goodman suggests that the overall effect of Brexit might be a strengthening of the view that fiat currencies are inherently unreliable, and that bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) are the best way to go.

""Brexit has hammered home the realization that most major governments don't care about having a 'strong' currency anymore,"" he says.

""Indeed, they see having a weak currency as an opportunity to boost their export industries. This nonchalance is leading to a race-to-the-bottom, with loose monetary policy used as a way to devalue national currencies and compete in the ongoing currency war.""

Significantly, Goodman believes this situation will only get worse with each additional global or regional recession, which will have the cumulative effect of shaking investors' faith in national currencies.

""If all national currencies continue to fall together, alternatives like bitcoin will look more and more attractive. Bitcoin can't be endlessly printed, there is a finite supply hard-coded into the network. This rule might as well be inscribed on tablets of stone. No national currency can boast such a guarantee of fixed supply, and I think Bitcoin's guarantee will look more and more impressive in the future, compared to incontinent national currency printing.""

Deal-Based Brexit or Remain

Of course, given that a (superficially) new exit deal has just been negotiated by the UK and the EU, there's still a chance that a no-deal Brexit could be averted. At the same time, the weakened, minority status of the UK government also creates scope for Parliament to vote for a second referendum, which might result in a Remain vote.

And in either of these cases, Glen Goodman expects the pound to rally, although in the case of a deal Brexit, the pound still might slip if the market believes the deal to be a bad one.

""In a deal-based Brexit or a Remain scenario, we can expect confidence in the pound to rise, as it has done every time hopes of a deal have risen,"" he explains.

""The cancellation of Brexit altogether would probably cause the pound to rise significantly. All of these moves in the pound would, of course, have a negative impact on BTC/GBP.""

But in the end, even if markets approve of Brexit's outcome, recent global history would indicate that the next crisis is only just around the corner. And with it, bitcoin is likely to rise even further.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-roundup-adoption-stories-and-new-developments/,"Bitcoin Cash Roundup: Adoption Stories and New Developments

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) adoption, development, and participation continue to spread as there’s been a myriad of BCH-related announcements in the last few weeks. Moreover, there’s now over 18 million bitcoin cash in circulation and only three million coins left to mine.

Bitcoin Cash Adoption and Announcements

The last few weeks have seen a variety of new adoption stories, software development, and new platforms that utilize BCH. Proponents of the decentralized cryptocurrency have been relentlessly pushing for mass adoption while showing a strong dedication toward scaling. Right now the price of bitcoin cash is hovering between $210-230 after most digital assets dropped a few percentages in value last week.

According to Coin Dance statistics, it is 489x more expensive to transact on the BTC chain in comparison to using the BCH network. Additionally, at the time of publication it is currently 3.5% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. BCH fans have also witnessed the 18 millionth coin mined on the chain and there’s now only three million BCH left to mine. The fact that there are so few left makes bitcoin cash scarce and far superior to the fiat currencies that can be printed on a whim.

Bitcoincash.org’s Developer Portal

On October 10, the website bitcoincash.org announced it is launching a developer portal so programmers can utilize tools to develop and build on BCH. “Create amazing apps with Bitcoin Cash with resources for developers, by developers,” the website explains. The bitcoincash.org developer portal has tools like Python and Javascript libraries, vocabulary and associated APIs for Bitcoin Cash, the Badger Wallet software development kit (SDK), and an SLP SDK. The portal gives blockchain engineers the means to create infrastructure and third-party services for the BCH chain.

The 0.20.4 version is available to download now for a variety of operating systems. In addition to the recent release, BCH developers from across multiple clients are preparing for the forthcoming November upgrade. BCH engineers plan to implement two new features: Schnorr support for OP_Checkmultisig and enforcing Minimaldata in script, otherwise known as the “Minimaldata” rule.

Telefuel Accepts Bitcoin Cash

A new unofficial platform for the Telegram messaging application Telefuel has announced the firm is now accepting bitcoin cash payments for its premium-tier services. Telefuel is an application for Telegram power users who can leverage the platform for coworking, collaboration, and productivity offerings. For instance, with Telefuel users can access Slack-like services that can support individual and group workflows. Features include chat folders, workspaces, keyboard shortcuts, unread mention filters, and split tabs for DMs, groups, bots, and channels.

“We’re building Telefuel to serve power users on Telegram, so crypto-industry professionals are obviously an important focus for us,” Telefuel co-founder Alan VanToai detailed. “Bitcoin Cash is an important pillar in the industry, so we’re happy to include BCH among the currencies we’re accepting for Telefuel Pro.”

Visual Recognition Engine Visionati Accepts Bitcoin Cash for Services

Another service that now accepts BCH is Visionati, a visual recognition engine that leverages artificial intelligence (AI). Visionati believes it’s the “most robust computer vision API on the market” by offering advanced algorithms and data. Users can harness the platform to interact with image and video metadata. Services offered include image and video analysis so people can make images and films searchable with the ability to filter as well. This includes automatic tagging, NSFW filtering, facial recognition, logo detection, color analysis, and optical character recognition. For services, Visionati accepts BCH, ETH, and BTC. The startup believes it is one of the first visual recognition products enhanced by AI that accepts digital assets.

Blockchain.poker’s Tournament Feature

A new feature is available at blockchain.poker for users who want to play poker for BCH, BTC, or BSV. Users can simply log in and sit down for a game or they can create their own tournament on the platform with the added functionality. The site’s owners recently revealed the poker platform’s tournament update on Twitter, explaining: “You can now earn bitcoin by creating your own sponsored tournaments on blockchain.poker. Create a tournament by clicking the “+” button at the bottom of the tournament lobby.”

This morning a few players announced on the Reddit forum r/btc a 0.5 BCH guaranteed prize pool tournament on the web portal. BCH fans seemed to enjoy the poker site’s announcement and one person remarked: “Keep up the great work guys — I’m convinced this is going to be huge once the key features you described here are implemented. The reputation system should mitigate a good portion of the risk of cheaters if done right.”

Upcoming Consensus Changes and the Road Forward

Overall there’s been a lot happening within the BCH ecosystem and passionate Bitcoin Cash proponents continue to truck forward. Bitcoin Cash miners, businesses, and node operators are also preparing for the consensus changes coming November 15. The upgrade is a touch over two weeks away and according to developers, the added features will continue to bolster the BCH roadmap going forward.

With mainstream exchanges becoming progressively cumbersome due to privacy invasive policy and regulation, some crypto traders are switching to more private, face-to-face trading. While this route isn’t for everyone, and comes with unique risks, it does offer a very real solution to many of the problems plaguing mainstream exchanges currently. The goal of this breakdown is to provide a few best practices for safety and success when trading crypto in person.

Also Read: Bitcoin Cash Roundup: Adoption Stories and New Developments

Why Face to Face?

For anyone that’s ever had their money frozen on an exchange, this question is a no-brainer. Since most exchange wallets are custodial, meaning the service itself holds and manages user funds centrally, one bug in the code, hack, or audit from a governmental regulatory agency could mean that you and your money are parted indefinitely. Stomach sinkers of this nature have occurred often enough that many, understandably, don’t want to run these risks anymore. Others are concerned about privacy and the security of their personal data and information. Trading in person via a non-custodial platform or otherwise lets traders hold funds until the very last second, and guarantees more control. Still, there are important things to be mindful of in order to trade safely and successfully.

Best Practices

To avoid getting scammed, set up, or potentially endangered, there are some time-tested best practices for trading face to face. The overarching one is simple, though: just use common sense.

Choose a trustworthy platform / trader

Maybe you know someone in your community who also uses cryptocurrencies. Perhaps a friend of a friend, or an acquaintance interested in getting into crypto, but they don’t know how. Online, reliable peer-to-peer platforms such as that currently offered at local.bitcoin.com are great places to start. Platforms that offer blind escrow, and end-to-end chat encryption are the safest bets. Whatever one’s approach, testing first and vetting for reliability is critical.

Using shoddy, unproven platforms or trading with strangers who’ve no reputation for being honest probably won’t end well. There are scammers as well as government agents on some p2p networks, and in real life, more than happy to ensnare even innocent, legal users of crypto for their own benefit.

Well-managed platforms will have a reputation system in place so users can verify which traders have completed the most trades successfully, and feedback features for rating their quality of service. Be sure to work out all the specifics of the trading process and procedure in clear detail on an encrypted chat application prior to meeting for the trade.

Meet in an open, highly visible public space

After working out the specifics of your deal, and providing only necessary information to the contact, meet in an open, highly visible space that is frequented by people but also provides enough serenity to conduct business. A well-lit coffee shop or popular meeting spot in view of the public can be a great place to conduct crypto trades. Trust your gut in meeting someone for the first time, and if anything “feels off,” don’t hesitate to politely back out.

Show me the money, discreetly

A great way to get scammed face to face is to send your bitcoins to the guy across the table and watch him run off without paying you. In this situation you could give chase (risky), yell, flail about, or call the cops, but you’re more than likely just SOL. Be sure the other person lets you see the money, gift cards, etc., first, before sending any coins.

Most respectable traders will place money on the table discreetly (in an envelope or book) so that it is within reach of both parties, and sudden moves to bolt are not likely to succeed. Once the tx has enough confirmations for the buyer’s liking, they should slide the money over and invite the other party to count it. If you are the one buying crypto be sure to make the seller feel at ease by setting up the trade similarly. Crypto-to-crypto deals require a bit more creativity perhaps, but having both devices in reach and openly in view can help.

Horse Sense Is Number One

There are limitless options for working out trustworthy trade arrangements, including step-by-step, fractional trades to test the waters on first meeting, PGP contracts making it difficult for a party to lie about the agreement after the fact, and verification via other contacts of a trader’s reputation. However, as mentioned earlier, the main thing is to trust your reason, and gut instinct. If some aspect of a crypto trade arrangement feels spooky or inconsistent, it’s more than okay to kick the deal and get out. More often than not, however, in person trades are fun, friendly experiences that can be a good way to get out of the typically isolated, smugly self-referential hell that is crypto Twitter, catching a breath of fresh air while stacking sats and building the bitcoin economy.

This move was part of the exchange giant’s peer-to-peer (P2P) trading rollout for Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) against the Chinese yuan.

The public nature of this announcement did bring questions to the fore regarding the use of payment channels like Alipay and WeChat for crypto trading. Alipay did, in fact, release statements distancing itself from cryptocurrency trading activities, with Binance later clarifying that it wasn’t working directly with the aforementioned payment services.

Meanwhile the evolving narrative around the situation speaks to the legal status of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in China. Even with a trading ban in place, there are whispers of a booming P2P trading arena, with authorities in Beijing seeming to adopt a “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” approach.

However, whenever these reports do make it into the public domain, Chinese authorities and businesses are swift to put a lid on them. Perhaps the arrival of the country’s proposed digital currency might necessitate the emergence of more clear-cut handling of crypto commerce in China.

Alipay wants nothing to do with Bitcoin

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Alibaba-owned payment channel Alipay has moved to ban transactions involving Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In an email to Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for the platform wrote:

“Alipay closely monitors over-the-counter (OTC) transactions to identify irregular behavior and ensure compliance with relevant regulations. If any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, we immediately stop the relevant payment services.”

This statement came in response to reports that Chinese crypto traders were using the platform as a P2P trading marketplace. Crypto exchange giant Binance even announced that it had enabled support for fiat deposits via Alipay and WeChat.

Cointelegraph spoke with Filipe Castro, co-founder and chief information officer of Utrust — a Swiss-based digital payments processor — about the Alipay announcement. “AliPay, as many other established companies are still focused on their traditional business models and see this ecosystem as a challenger,” Castro said.

For the Utrust chief, Alipay’s status as a major player in China’s electronic payment arena means it has to work toward balancing the need for increasing revenue streams and compliance with directives from authorities in Beijing. Castro also highlighted the less than favorable standing held by the crypto industry in China, noting:

“Mainland China has strict laws banning gambling, and many still see cryptocurrency as such. Alipay and other providers still look at other cryptocurrency providers as investment outlets and not payment vehicles. Thus, until this perception changes, it is likely that current measures will stay in force.”

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Celine Lu, founder and CEO of BitDeer — a hashpower sharing platform — provided further insight. According to Lu, the Chinese government pays particular attention to the activities of popular third-party payment processors like Alipay:

“In these regulations, the state clarifies the nature of Bitcoin as a virtual commodity. At the same time, for the purpose of prevention of risks to the financial system, the relevant regulations limit the participation of financial institutions and payment institutions in Bitcoin-related activities.”

Alipay isn’t alone in coming out to distance itself from Bitcoin OTC trading. Back in May 2019, WeChat changed its payment policy, forbidding the use of its platform for P2P transactions.

Is it all about the narrative?

However, despite Alipay coming out to deny the use of its platform for Bitcoin OTC trading, several commentators say the practice is common in China. The summary of the arguments posited by many is that such activities while illegal on paper, fall into a regulatory gray area.

To clarify, Bitcoin OTC trading is not in itself illegal in China. Back in May 2019, the government revealed that the 2017 trading and initial coin offering (ICO) ban did not affect Bitcoin’s legal status as a property that can be held or exchanged via P2P channels.

Indeed, following the 2017 trading and ICO ban, reports began to emerge of growing P2P Bitcoin trading in China. Platforms like WeChat became marketplaces for the convergence of prospective buyers and sellers.

There are even reports that major crypto exchanges use these backchannel avenues to conduct P2P Bitcoin trading in China. These exchanges reportedly mask such activities by using the guise of running a P2P trading desk for the BTC/USDT trading pair. OTC P2P trading reportedly accounts for the overwhelming majority of Chinese BTC/CNY trading. Users place manual buy and sell orders, with the exchanges acting as the go-between.

Given the informal nature of the arrangement, counterparty risk becomes a major problem. The buyer reportedly has to send fiat payments first before receiving the agreed-upon Bitcoin. Thus, these marketplaces tend to put in a lot of effort in ensuring that participants hold to their respective ends of the bargain.

The fiat payment part of the deal requires channels like WeChat, Alipay or wire transfers. However, financial institutions in mainland China are barred from facilitating crypto transactions. Thus, users of such channels usually run the risk of having their accounts terminated.

However, some commentators allege that such practices are possible not because of regulatory loopholes but due to an unwritten “implied consent” of some Chinese government officials. These people claim that crypto exchanges have forged useful relationships with key actors in Beijing that help to smoothen any legal wrinkles.

While the Alipay/Binance situation was unfolding, a Twitter account named Blocfilo posted some startling revelations about the Chinese crypto trading scene. Allegedly, despite the trading ban, many cryptocurrency exchanges still operate and have their headquarters in mainland China. The self-professed crypto exchange analyst also tweeted that government officials are prepared to look the other way as long as they receive bribes from the platforms. Excerpts from the thread read:

“You just gotta pay the government officials some money and you can operate just fine under the radar. A lot of crypto exchanges have already become banks to certain extent. Only the legitimate ones will survive in the long run though.”

Cointelegraph reached out to several Chinese crypto exchanges to ascertain the veracity of these claims. The platforms that responded declined to comment on the matter. If such statements are true, then it appears authorities in Beijing seem more concerned with optics rather than actual trading activities.

Crypto-yuan: To be or not to be?

Back in April 2018, Chinese social media-based news platform cnLedger revealed that there was a booming Bitcoin OTC trade for crypto bulls in the country. As reported by Cointelegraph at the time, traders in China were paying a premium for BTC via these OTC desks. Chinese traders exchange CNY for USDT, which is then used to purchase BTC overseas. Such activities bring capital control issues with yuan deposits leaving the country.

Indeed, one of the objections raised by China to Facebook’s proposed Libra cryptocurrency project is the potential impact on its capital control efforts. Some countries in Europe, such as Germany and France, say Libra could have troubling implications for the monetary sovereignty of nations.

There has been talk for some time of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) creating a digital yuan currency. Some commentators suggest that such a move even presents greater prominence following the Libra announcement.

China already has a well-developed electronic payment ecosystem with the likes of Alipay and WeChat dominating the scene. The coming of a digital yuan is seen by some as an effort by the government to prevent the penetration of cryptocurrencies into the space.

Cointelegraph asked Utrust’s Castro about the potential impact of Alipay’s announcement distancing itself from Bitcoin trading on the future of crypto payments in China. According to Castro, Alipay’s stance is not surprising given what it has said in the past, adding:

“The advent of an e-Yuan digital currency, natively developed in China could help shape its strategic stance going forward. Competition from Libra and other private initiatives can undoubtedly act as a catalyst that accelerates this process.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, there is still no official consensus on the exact release date for the proposed digital yuan currency. Back in August, reports emerged that the PBoC was ready to roll out the central bank digital currency, or CBDC. However, conflicting revelations emerged a month later saying the central bank still required more time to study the pros and cons.

China’s proposed digital currency coupled with Facebook’s foray into the market has also reportedly spooked several key actors within the European Union. In an op-ed in the Financial Times, Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, urged the EU to consider creating its own digital currency. According to Le Maire:

“We [the European Central Bank] should consider the creation of central banks’ own digital currencies, in the medium to long term. We cannot let China be the only player in this field. Our independence is at stake.”

Le Maire’s aversion to the involvement of private institutions in global monetary affairs echoes some of the sentiments the Utrust co-founder shared with Cointelegraph. During the interview, Castro highlighted the still-prevailing negative rhetoric surrounding the industry, stating, “There are many challenges still ahead, namely the establishment of a good, credible and trustworthy brand reputation for the cryptocurrency ecosystem.”

For now, the likes of Alipay need to maintain a public perception of crypto-aversion, even if private dealings reveal otherwise. Perhaps a time will come when governments will no longer be able to cast the industry in a bad light and cryptocurrencies will usher in the expected global electronic payment revolution.",,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-tidbits-fidelity-bitcoin-ripple-xrp-grayscale-altcoin/,"Another week, another of Crypto Tidbits.

British lawmakers have voted to postpone a crucial Brexit vote and forced Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask the EU for an extension. News.Bitcoin.com talked to the CEO of a local crypto exchange to find out the effects a no-deal Brexit could have on the crypto industry.

Effects of No-Deal Brexit on Cryptocurrencies

On Saturday, the British parliament voted to put off a decision on Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s deal, forcing him to ask the EU for another Brexit delay. William Thomas, CEO of peer-to-peer exchange Cryptomate, explained to news.Bitcoin.com that many people are calling this deal “‘Brexit in name only’ as it still ties us in with many EU institutions, including future regulatory alignment,” adding that a no-deal Brexit is becoming even more of a possibility.

In the event of no-deal being reached by Oct. 31, Thomas said, “there will be substantial uncertainty within British and EU financial institutions.” However, in terms of whether it will create demand for bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, “I am not so certain,” he admitted, elaborating:

I would expect to see some upward movement on BTC/GBP markets shortly after the deadline, but since the British pound is a small portion of global crypto volume it may not have a large overall effect on price as some have predicted.

“It will, however, have a positive impact within the British market, but the degree of which this will affect the global cryptocurrency markets is speculative at this time,” he opined.

Cryptomate allows British users to purchase a wide range of cryptocurrencies via instant bank transfer. The platform claims to have served 11,250 customers, filled 44,853 orders worth approximately 14.43 million British pounds (~$18.74 million).

How the UK Crypto Industry Could Be Affected

Thomas further explained to news.Bitcoin.com how the U.K. cryptocurrency industry will likely be affected in the event of a no-deal Brexit. “For larger traditional financial service industries that operate out of London, there are safeguards that will see financial services ‘passporting’ to the EU market will continue until future agreements are made,” he remarked.

However, there is nothing in place and very little guidance from the British Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) about how this should affect the crypto industry and related services. “There is a huge lack of clarity in the area,” he emphasized. Nonetheless, he shared:

It’s my personal belief that a no-deal Brexit would be a huge positive for the U.K. cryptocurrency industry in the long term, as it enables us to create our own regulatory systems without interference from the EU – who are much less friendly to the industry as a whole compared to the U.K.

Other Expectations

For European Union customers who use British-based exchange/wallet services and vise-versa, Thomas said that a no-deal Brexit “will have very little impact” on them. “British and EU customers will still be able to use SEPA bank payments which account for most exchange deposits within Europe, so trading volume should remain unchanged,” the CEO continued, noting:

Britain will continue regulatory alignment with the EU the day after we leave (until December 2020) so there’s no reason to think there will be any major disruption to banking or money services on November 1st.

As for Cryptomate, Thomas confirmed: “We will continue to accept European Union customers who have access to UK banking and this policy will not change unless we’re told differently by the FCA.” He added that most sellers on his platform have indicated that they “will be keeping their trading funds in USDT, as opposed to GBP or EUR,” noting:

We would expect to see demand for bitcoin and others increase during November, as a no-deal is likely to see the pound weaken further against the euro (and the euro vs the dollar) as people look for safe havens outside of fiat.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex International is discontinuing operations in 31 countries, including Venezuela and Zimbabwe. The trading platform has justified its decision on the basis of the regulatory uncertainty in these jurisdictions. Some of the nations in the list are going through political turmoil and socio-economic challenges.

Zimbabwe and Venezuela Among Restricted Nations

Bittrex International, the global trading platform managed by the Seattle-based digital asset exchange Bittrex, has informed clients residing in the affected countries that they will no longer be able to use its services. The main reason for the decision lies in the unstable regulatory environment there, the company explained in an announcement published on its website this Friday.

“All trading and account access for these impacted customers will be halted on Tuesday, October 29 date at 19:00 UTC/21:00 CEST,” Bittrex detailed. Users have been asked to withdraw their coins and tokens from the platform before the deadline. To do so, they’ll have to log into their Bittrex International account, click “Holdings,” search for the wallet, and click the withdrawal button.

The exchange warns traders they won’t be able to withdraw their balance if it’s below a certain threshold. “The minimum withdrawal for all coins must be greater than 3 times the fee,” the company notes and provides an example: “Your balance in BTC must be .00150001 or greater as the fee is .0005.” Users can find additional withdrawal instructions in the FAQ section of the platform’s website.

Bittrex’s decision to halt exchange operations mostly concerns customers in developing countries. Many of these markets are in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, including crisis-hit Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Pakistan. Bosnia-Herzegovina is the only European jurisdiction on the list. Crypto traders in economically battered Venezuela are also among those that will not be able to use its exchange services in the future.

Crypto Exchanges Under Pressure From Governments

The move affecting its international trading platform comes after Bittrex delisted dozens of coins and tokens this summer that were available previously to U.S.-based traders. Although the exchange explains that a major criterion it considers in such cases is the lack of interest in a project, regulatory pressure in the United States may have also played a role.

Evolving regulatory standards and other compliance issues have been listed among the key factors in its official token removal policy, which the company takes into account when determining whether to delist a coin or remove a market. For example, in April this year the New York State Department of Financial Services ordered Bittrex to cease operations after rejecting its application for a Bitlicense.

International sanctions have also influenced the business decisions of companies in the crypto space. Towards the end of last year, reports came out that users of leading digital asset exchange Binance had been cut off in certain countries. Iran, Belarus, Serbia, Bosnia, Myanmar, and other restricted jurisdictions were affected. Some of those are on the sanctions lists of the UN Security Council and the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.

2019 has been the year in which crypto lending has really taken off.

Why be penalized for saving fiat when you can be rewarded for saving crypto?

Crypto Lending Options Are Stacking Up

Competition among crypto lending platforms is heating up. With major exchanges such as Binance throwing their considerable weight behind the movement, incumbent platforms have been sharpening the pencil in a bid to offer their lenders and borrowers a better APR. In May, Bitcoin.com and Cred introduced a partnership enabling Bitcoin.com customers to earn up to 10% on their BTC and BCH holdings. Terms are set at six months, but can roll over, if desired. No minimum is needed to be eligible, and interest is paid out in stablecoin every three months.

This week, meanwhile, Nexo, cut its borrowing rates to as low as 5.9%. Given that many crypto lenders are prone to charge up to 4% in origination fees and 5-13% in liquidation fees, Nexo is confident that its improved offer will entice crypto borrowers shopping around for the best deal.

That shopping process has gotten a lot easier thanks to the emergence of crypto lending comparison portals. These platforms provide a side-by-side comparison of what the leading centralized and decentralized lending solutions have to offer. Last week, Coinmarketcap launched a product that heralds its entry into the growing defi market. The tool, which the listing site has dubbed Coinmarketcap Interest, features finance data such as the best annualized interest rates for borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies across a variety of platforms.

Coinmarketcap doesn’t hold first mover advantage in this sphere, however, as there are already a number of high-level tools for analyzing the lending marketplace.

Loanscan

Loanscan is perhaps the gold standard in the sector, and after a redesign in May the site is better than ever. Originally built as a stealth tool for the crypto lending app Linen, Loanscan now serves as a standalone interest comparison product. The site is packed with features, information and graphical visualizations, making it fun just to play around with, depending on your love for data.

The site allows you to view address, protocol, or asset level analytics across a range of timeframes, such as 24-hours, week or month. For those who take a keen interest not only in where the market is today, but where it has been, Loanscan has a historical data tab too.

The range of possibilities with Loanscan is significant, so whether you want to know what the current value of all outstanding loans in the market is ($142M) or what the one-month repayments are ($67M) you shouldn’t have trouble finding the answer. Most importantly, Loanscan also provides comparison tables of the best interest rates for loaning and lending cryptocurrencies featuring DAI, ETH and BTC on platforms such as dYdX, Dharma, Fulcrum and Makerdao.

Due to its depth of information and rich presentation style, Loanscan is probably still the best all-round destination for experienced crypto users, however, there are simpler information sources out there.

Coinmarketcap Interest

While Coinmarketcap Interest doesn’t offer the same level of graphical wizardry as Loanscan, instead opting for a plain yet clean UI, it does pack a punch in terms of the information offered and ease of use. For those already well acquainted with the CMC layout and style, there is little adjustment required to get up to speed with Coinmarketcap Interest.

For the 30 or more stablecoins and cryptocurrencies which feature on CMC Interest, each has two tabs: “Earn Interest” and “Borrow Crypto.” All you need to do is select the currency you’d like to borrow or lend on the left, and then select a preferred platform depending on annualized interest rate, whether the platform is CEX or DEX, and the duration of the loan.

All in all it’s a pretty slick operation and while you don’t get the same level of control or information as you do on Loanscan, for those who just want to make money or borrow it without any of the deep-level analysis, CMC Interest works well.

Earn Crypto Interest

With 74 cryptocurrencies and 153 interest rates quoted, Earn Crypto Interest is packing stats. It has dedicated sections for new offers, popular interest-paying offers, and a widget for those who’d like to display the most popular crypto interests rates on their site. Click on the plus symbol alongside each currency to learn where you can earn interest for staking and lending it.

Defi Pulse

If you’re more interested in broader ecosystem statistics than individual loans, Defi Pulse is another great analytical tool for decentralized finance and statistics geeks. For instance, if you want to know the total amount of money locked up in smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, Defi Pulse has got you covered. Want to know the current public network capacity of the Lightning Network? Defi Pulse has that too. You can also find out how much is locked up in DEXs, derivatives, assets and more, making it a highly useful tool for anyone doing deep research into the overall market.

Crypto networks are built upon open access and transparency. Thanks to monitoring sites and comparison tools that tap into solutions built upon these blockchains, cryptocurrency users can determine the best way to maximize their holdings. If you’re interested in interest, it pays to do your research.

Seemingly every few weeks, the cryptocurrency would hit a new price milestone, mounting past $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and so on in rapid succession. This upward price action led many to make zany predictions.

John McAfee, the libertarian cybersecurity guru-turned-cryptocurrency proponent, for instance, argued that by the end of 2020, BTC would eclipse one million dollars.

While many cynics have laughed off this, well, lofty price prediction, McAfee is sticking to his guns. In fact, he recently upped his prediction…

Bitcoin To Hit 2 Million?

In an interview with AIBCSummit, McAfee said the following: “Run the f***ing numbers. If Bitcoin is less than $2 million by the end of 2020, then mathematics itself is a flawed disappointment.”

He backed this prediction by citing scarcity. In an interview with Forbes, he stated:

“Let’s get real, there are only 21 million bitcoins. Seven million of which have been lost forever, and then, if Satoshi [bitcoin’s anonymous creator] is dead, add a few more million.”

What he’s arguing is that with increased demand for Bitcoin, the ultra scarce nature of the cryptocurrency will lead to a surge in price as there won’t be enough coins being fed into the market at low price points to satisfy demand.

A Bit Too Optimistic, No?

Although McAfee has remained committed to his lofty price prediction through the thick and thin, not budging one bit, models — and even generous models at that — have shown that Bitcoin hitting $1 million by 2020 is highly unlikely, barring a fully-fledged collapse of the fiat financial system and a subsequent rapid global adoption of cryptocurrency.

An analyst at Munich-based financial institution Bayerische Landesbank wrote that Bitcoin’s next block reward reduction will give each BTC a fair valuation of $90,000, correlating the cryptocurrency’s inflation rate to its market capitalization. The same model says that the analyst uses says that a $1 million price point will only become feasible starting from the block reward reduction after that, expected to take place in 2024 at the earliest.

Also, engineer Harold Burger recently threw cold water on McAfee’s call.

In an article titled “Bitcoin’s natural long-term power-law corridor of growth”, Burger remarked that Bitcoin fits into a natural “power law” price corridor, which has been tightening over time from a logarithmic perspective. It predicts that the BTC price will not reach $1 million until 2028 at the earliest, if at all.

And, Bytetree, a BTC analytics firm, found that Bitcoin’s internal rate of return has fallen to 115% per annum, which implies that it won’t be until around 2029 that the cryptocurrency finally manages to crack into the seven-digit price point region.

Crazy, I know.

Few are as upset about the whole thing as those who are involved in crypto for ideological reasons—or, at least, those who say they are.



That brings us to Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer at CoinShares. A newly posted 37-minute in-depth interview with her on financial news channel RealVision [subscription required] is worth watching in its entirety even if one reaches different conclusions because she’s an articulate proponent of her viewpoints. Sure, her firm is all about offering products for those who want to trade in crypto in much the same way they trade other assets. However, Demirors repeatedly throws some shade at the “financialization” of digital assets.

“If we take 50% of the world’s Bitcoin and we put it in custody with a custodian that’s regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, the Fed and all of the powers that be,” pondered Demirors 18 minutes into the video, “and we take these bitcoins, and we put them in a vault somewhere… and then we issue Bitcoin depository receipts—pieces of paper that allow us to trade the underlying bitcoins sitting in a vault somewhere—but we never actually exchange bitcoin on the Bitcoin network, is that still bitcoin?”

“These are the types of questions I want us to be asking,” she said. “By the way, as an asset manager, we are a part of the problem. I don’t claim to have a grand solution, but I think it’s important to ask ourselves as the industry grows, as the industry matures, and particularly as many Wall Street types come into the industry who don’t share our values, who don’t share our principles, I like to say they’re LARP-ing—they’re live action role playing.”

In other asset classes where paper is traded, such concerns generally aren’t on the mind of investors. For example, few would ask if grain futures that settle for cash are edible any more than they would question whether the underlying asset isn’t. Yes, gold bugs will shout from rooftops that the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) is merely paper gold and not the real thing—and one can’t watch Fox News or listen to conservative podcasts without hearing a pitch for services offering physical gold (at a markup, of course). But for the most part, such worries are not keeping traders up at night and GLD’s net assets are around $44 billion at the moment.

What makes Bitcoin and other digital assets so different? Perhaps it’s their history.

At the start of the interview, Demirors offered a long and interesting take on the role of cryptocurrencies as seen through the lens of Polybius’ anacyclosis theory of how political structures are sequenced (For those who want the Wikipedia version, it’s “1. monarchy, 2. kingship, 3. tyranny, 4. aristocracy, 5. oligarchy, 6. democracy, and 7. ochlocracy.”).

According to Demirors, we’re at “ochlocracy or ruled by mob, which is [when] the loudest voices are really ruling. That’s the age I think we’re in now with Twitter and social media and the way information spreads… most ‘information’ is factually incorrect, or based on assumptions rather than corroborated fact.”

“Think about [Bitcoin] through that lens of how humans organize and the tools we need to enable these different phases of human social organization,” she then said, “because it started with libertarians and anarchists.”

That’s a darker view of the current state of the world given just how good things really are. Also, it’s missing an important point as it relates to gold.

Later in the interview, Demirors was asked about the similarity between gold and Bitcoin. Both are subject to the “3Ds” she said—demand, depletion (that is, future mining), and a relationship with the U.S. dollar—in other words, the opportunity costs of holding one in place of keeping cash.

“What I think is really interesting about gold and Bitcoin as analogs is gold has value in the physical world,” said Demirors. “It has this cultural cache, and so much of gold is not just about this 3Ds, but it’s also the psychology of it, and the role that gold has in our history as humans, the role it has in our society and culture and the physicality of it.”

“I think Bitcoin is digital gold,” she declared. “It’s the digital analog to gold.”

And while that sentiment is almost a mantra in the cryptoverse, the two are barely comparable.



Gold’s key part in wealth in our society came only after its utility proved its value. It’s a malleable metal that doesn’t rust and looks pretty. For our primitive ancestors, that was like magic from whatever heathen gods to whom they sacrificed their children. It’s why they mined it and ultimately valued the yellow metal so much, something that persists to this day.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, has gained in value solely for its potential—but not yet established—utility.

Anecdotes about Venezuelans using crypto in the face of hyperinflation or Chinese billionaires secretly buying bitcoins to escape capital controls still haven’t really proven how Bitcoin replaces fiat as the go-to method of getting paid for most of the world. In theory, it should. But it hasn’t, much the same way as you could have an affair with Beyoncé because she is alive on earth and so are you—yet it’s not happening any time soon.

As the price of bitcoins fell in 2018, so too did the use of the cryptocurrency to pay for things. But what didn’t go down were transactions using Visa that year. That’s not a sign of a successful revolution that will change the way we store, account, and spend our wealth unless that revolution is one run by Woody Allen’s Fielding Mellish.

It’s worth noting that the interview with Demirors was released just as the G7 issued a report critical of stablecoins.

“The first wave of cryptoassets, of which Bitcoin is the best known, have so far failed to provide a reliable and attractive means of payment or store of value,” the report said. “They have suffered from highly volatile prices, limits to scalability, complicated user interfaces, and issues in governance and regulation, among other challenges. Thus, cryptoassets have served more as a highly speculative asset class for certain investors and those engaged in illicit activities rather than as a means to make payments.”

Stablecoins, on the hand, are a “more readily usable as a means of payment and store of value, and they could potentially foster the development of global payment arrangements that are faster, cheaper and more inclusive than present arrangements,” it added.

Yet the report spends 28 more pages spelling out all the trouble with stablecoins. In other words, crypto’s more compelling byproduct has its own headaches.

Critics will argue that the G7 is merely a pile of bankers and politicians white-knuckle-grasping the current economic system as the glorious cryptocurrency revolutionaries sharpen their guillotines.

Further, they’ll cite Wall Street and other big businesses’ dalliance with blockchain as proof this is indeed the future. JPMorgan Coin and Facebook’s Libra come to mind. And central banks have been poking around the idea of applying the technology to what they do.

Yet these are relatively minor investments compared to their total assets. Perhaps it’s a hedge just in case the overthrow really does happen. Or it’s a way to tell clients and customers that they’re on top of the latest trends in technology.

Or—most likely—there’s indeed some value in distributed ledger technology but only in instances where an Excel spreadsheet or, say, a LAMP stack wouldn’t be secure enough. Co-opting the best parts and leaving everything else in the dust is how successful businesses move forward.

And there’s one final problem with the gold-Bitcoin analogy and it’s one the “self-sovereign” types who embrace cryptocurrencies refuse to recognize.

When discussing the post-War Bretton Woods System based on the gold standard, one doesn’t say it “went away.” Instead, one says it “collapsed.” The U.S. was spending extravagant amounts on guns and butter and couldn’t stabilize things using price controls. And once the system collapsed, inflation soared.

But then a funny thing happened. Over time, inflation came under control. The dollar devalued but the economy in real terms grew over the decades. And when the Big One came—the Financial Crisis—the world didn’t end. Quantitative Easing may have flooded economies with cash but runaway inflation didn’t happen as feared by many (including this writer).

The first Bitcoin block included a message, “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” Many took that as a symbol for why Bitcoin was needed. Yet Bitcoin launched to solve a horrible problem that never came about—namely, a complete and irreparable economic breakdown.

Money supply, it turns out, can grow with an economy over the long run and it doesn’t always lead to people walking around with wheelbarrows full of paper currency to buy a loaf of bread. Meanwhile, price controls with a finite asset—such as gold— backing the currency aren’t the greatest bargain either.

In a world where Bitcoin replaces all currencies, however, that’s essentially what maximalists envision. And in that world, the current order of things—who has the most wealth—is replaced by a new order, where the early adopters then become the wealthiest. And if anyone has ever been to a party where they’re cornered by a Bitcoin maximalist, it’s like listening to a cult member talk about how they’re going to be saved and you won’t, because they saw the light before you did. No one likes those people, and most would rather be in an economic Hell so long as they don’t have to grant power to such annoying people.

So perhaps instead of lamenting or worrying about the “financialization” of crypto, Demirors should be singing hosannas to it. Speculation in Bitcoin—and it’s becoming almost entirely Bitcoin again—is what keeps its value there. It attracts capital in projects that may otherwise not get funding. It keeps interest alive in hopes of finding that one thing that will survive even if every other aspect of digital assets were to be abandoned.

Wall Street isn’t the enemy of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology so long as investors and speculators hope financial types will find something to gain from it. It’s the biggest thing keeping the whole project going right now.

After sitting around $257 billion, the cryptocurrency market lost $35 billion in less than 30 minutes on September 24. Since then, many digital assets have found new support, but bears have started to claw away at these areas. Most cryptocurrencies are testing their weekly support trendline that started gathering steam in May as the market approaches a crucial turning point.

While Holding Foundational Support, Crypto Markets Face a Fork in the Road

On October 20, digital currency markets are meandering at levels not seen since spring and many traders are uncertain where the road will lead. The market cap of all 2,000+ cryptocurrencies is hovering around $220 billion and global trade volume is about $50 billion. BTC has wavered between $7,900-8,090 in the last 24 hours and prices are down 4.7% for the week. The overall BTC market valuation is $144 billion out of the $220 billion, representing 66% dominance over other coins.

Ethereum (ETH) is down 5.4% this Sunday and each ETH is swapping for $173. Behind ETH is ripple (XRP) as each coin is trading for $0.29 but prices are up 4% over the last seven days. The stablecoin tether (USDT) is sitting in fourth position today as lots of traders are using the coin to hedge. Tether is capturing the majority of global trades across nearly every digital asset in the economy and USDT is trading $3.8 billion more in volume than BTC today.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Market Action

The fifth largest market capitalization is held by bitcoin cash (BCH) with a total valuation of around $3.8 billion at press time. Each BCH is swapping for $215 per coin at the moment and there’s a touch over a billion in global trade volume today. BCH is down 0.44% this Sunday, and over the last seven days the asset has lost 4.7%. Additionally, BCH is currently the seventh most traded coin below EOS and above TRX. Tether (USDT) is the top pair traded with BCH, capturing 55% of the day’s trades and BTC has around 20% of trades.

This is followed by ETH (11.6%), USD (10%), and KRW (1%). During the last few weeks, honestcoin (USDH) has entered the top 10 pairs with BCH and currently sits in seventh position. The dumps taking place across the broader crypto markets have caused BCH to slide in value but its has steered clear of a key support level between $195-205.

Whale Movements and Rekt Long Positions

Traders have seen some significant price movements since the end of September and during this time large holders have been moving massive sums of cryptocurrencies. According to Whale Alert, a Twitter bot that tracks coins like BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, EOS, BNB, and XLM, millions of dollars (occasionally a billion) in single transactions have been moved by whales.

On October 17, a transaction for 9,999 BTC was seen and millions of tethers are moving between huge wallets and the top exchanges on a regular basis. In addition to the enormous movements, another tracker called Whalecalls shows that a bunch of traders playing long positions on Okcoin are being liquidated routinely. Similar action can be seen on leveraged markets on Bitfinex and Bitmex as well.

Futures Markets Might Be Smacking BTC Prices Around

People have been obsessed for quite some time trying to figure out why BTC prices move a certain way. The last two weeks of bearish action have been odd to some traders but other speculators believe the volatility is stemming from futures markets. When Bakkt first launched and the price of BTC dropped significantly on September 24, the senior market analyst at Etoro, Mati Greenspan, said: “The catalyst for today’s plunge, in my mind, seems to be the underwhelming launch of Bakkt. [This is a prime example] of buy the rumor, sell the news.”

“Bitcoin’s recent price drop is a result of technical and fundamental factors, including a breakdown of the consolidation range, Bakkt’s tame launch of futures, and a sudden network hash rate drop,” explained Joe DiPasquale, CEO of Bitbull Capital, after the initial price drop. On October 13, Zak Selbert, chief executive of Indexica, explained that the action is due to BTC’s maturity in traditional capital markets.

“Now that bitcoin is a big kid, anything can make it move, just like anything can make gold or a G-10 currency move,” Selbert said. “Bitcoin is part of the financial landscape in a very intertwined and mature way.”

Fear and Head-Fakes

During the last two weeks or longer, the general sentiment throughout the cryptoconomy has been quite bearish. At the time of writing, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (CFGI) indicates that investors are showing a level of “fear.” However, in August the CFGI score was an 11, which pointed to “extreme fear” in regard to the crypto community’s emotions and sentiments. Today’s data stands at 37, which is far better than the summer.

Good potential for a Head Fake in $BTCUSD. Wait for it. https://t.co/JR0rYZdUfS — John Bollinger (@bbands) October 16, 2019

The CFGI index dropped to a low of 24 on September 27, indicating that even though market trends have been dreary, the general sentiment is improving. While watching BTC/USD movements on October 17, technical analyst John Bollinger stated that there was a possibility of a “head-fake.” Essentially, a head-fake is when an asset’s price makes a swing in the reverse direction out of nowhere but traditionally when prices touch support foundations.

All Eyes Are Watching Crypto Charts, Indicators and Any Signs of Forecast Signals

At the time of publication, most digital asset prices are wandering aimlessly just above the support levels held months ago. Traders have their eyes peeled while closely watching moving averages, liquidity, global trade volumes, and major support or resistance levels. It’s safe to say that even the most prescient analysts do not know which way crypto markets will swing from here. However, veteran traders understand very well that market prices are at a pivotal position and face a fork in the road.

The complaint filed on Oct. 17 claims that Shapiro is “a two-time Emmy Award-winning media and technology expert, author, and adjunct professor at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts.” The lawsuit alleges that between May 16 and May 18 AT&T employees transferred access to Shapiro’s mobile phone to outside hackers:

“AT&T employees obtained unauthorized access to Mr. Shapiro’s AT&T wireless account, viewed his confidential and proprietary personal information, and transferred control [...] to a phone controlled by third-party hackers in exchange for money. [...] The hackers then utilized their control over Mr. Shapiro’s AT&T wireless number [...] to access his personal and digital finance accounts and steal more than $1.8 million.”

All accounts compromised

The document states that these actions allowed the hackers to also access Shapiro’s personal accounts on several cryptocurrency exchanges:

""While third parties had control over Mr. Shapiro's AT&T wireless number, they used that control to access and reset the passwords for Mr. Shapiro's accounts on cryptocurrency exchange platforms including KuCoin, Bittrex, Wax, Coinbase, Huobi, Crytopia, LiveCoin, HitBTC, Coss.io, Liqui, and Bitfinex.""

The plaintiff also claims to be in possession of chat logs in which AT&T employees and hackers discuss how the stolen money should be routed and brag about how much they took.

History repeating

Shapiro also claims that he fell victim to SIM-swapping multiple times, therefore his personal information and online accounts were already leaked in the past. The complaint states:

“AT&T’s Repeated Failures to Protect Mr. Shapiro’s Account from Unauthorized Access Are a Violation of Federal Law.”

More precisely, Shapiro alleges that AT&T is in violation of the Federal Communications Act for failing to protect the confidentiality of his account information.

He also claims that the telecom giant violated several California state’s laws, including the Unfair Competition Law, the Constitutional Right to Privacy and the Consumers Legal Remedy Act. Lastly, Shapiro also accuses AT&T of two acts of negligence.

Notably, this is not the first lawsuit against AT&T over SIM-swapping. As Cointelegraph reported on July 27, the federal judge overseeing the Terpin v. AT&T case dismissed the motion. At the time, this was the latest development in a legal battle pertaining to cryptocurrencies stolen via SIM-swapping that has been going on for almost a year.",,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-news-from-brazil-oct-1420-in-review,"Brazil has seen another tumultuous week in the cryptocurrency industry as the president of investment scheme Unick Forex said it will only pay customers who have kept their receipts, the 18th million Bitcoin (BTC) was mined, and the alleged pyramid scheme Atlas Quantum denied that videos with balances at Gate.io and HitBTC are fake.

Here is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph Brasil.

Unick Forex says it will only pay customers who have a receipt

The president of alleged cryptocurrency investment scheme Unick Forex Leidimar Lopes said that anyone who has lost proof of payment will not be compensated by the company, stating:

""[Unick customer] You should look for proof as it is the only valid document to show that you have actually purchased a product, enabling you to become a bonus member.”

Following a police investigation into Unick Forex, staff reportedly fled the firm’s offices with computers and other hardware in tow. Previously, the Sao Paulo Court of Justice issued an injunction against the scheme after a user of the platform complained about delay withdrawals.

Wish Money revealed to be a scam

On Oct. 17, a series of audio recordings of the leaders and CEO of cryptocurrency investment company Wish Money revealed that company managers knew the firm was bankrupt and was a financial pyramid scam. The audio files were reportedly taken from a meeting between company leaders responsible for attracting new investors and Wish Money CEO Sabrina Victor. The Wish Money company has not paid any of its investors in weeks.

Atlas Quantum denies videos are fake

On Oct. 13, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the cryptocurrency platform and alleged pyramid scheme Atlas Quantum denied that videos with company balances at Gate.io and HitBTC are fake, even though the exchanges themselves claimed that they were forged.

In September, Atlas released a video showing balances on three exchanges, HitBTC, Gate.io and Poloniex, stating that the balances were blocked by Know Your Customer issues, saying:

""The video below shows our balance on nine accounts from three exchanges in which we operate.”

However, the exchange HitBTC came forward and said that the video was fake and that Atlas never had any locked accounts in the exchange. Gate.io similarly stated that the videos were forged and made to fool users. The Atlas press office has denied the exchanges’ claims and reaffirmed the validity of the videos.

The allegedly forged videos surfaced after customers complained of delayed or halted withdrawals, which Atlas is now saying it will eventually pay out dues in reals, and that measures to redeem balances will be announced soon.

According to an official Medium post published on Oct. 17, this will allow crypto enthusiasts to use one ENS name for all of their crypto wallets.

Ongoing implementation

It is noted that ENS’s user interface currently only supports Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) addresses — and not all of the encodings. Still, the post promises that its functionality will be expanded in the coming weeks.

Among the new wallets committed to integrate the feature are D’CENT Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, Bitcoin.com, Opera, TrustWallet, imToken, Portis, MyCrypto, Haven, Atomic Wallet, Squarelink, Coin Request, DexWallet, Enjin and Wyre.

Expanding beyond .ETH

The team also plans to integrate the DNS namespace to support addresses like .org, .com and others. This functionality has already been implemented for such domains as .xyz, .luxe, .kred and .art, according to the announcement. ENS intends to roll out support for all DNSSEC-enabled top-level domains in the near future.

As Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 1, ENS name auctions were halted because of a bug that resulted in domain names being awarded to the wrong users and for lower bids. Still, the hacker — who stole 17 names by exploiting the bug — decided to return all the domains to the rightful owners some days later.",

The failure by bulls to push Bitcoin higher and reignite the FOMO from the crypto hype bubble has caused fear to take hold of crypto investors who are worried the bear market bottom isn’t actually in, and new lows may be set.

One crypto analyst, says that not only could new lows below $3,000 be set, but that Bitcoin could fall another 90% to as low as $300.

Crypto Analyst Doesn’t See Yearly Support Until $300 BTC

After a parabolic rally from April through August, Bitcoin was rejected at $14,000 and after consolidation for a few months under the resistance level, the price of the first-ever crypto-asset began to fall and is now valued at over 40% less than the local high.

The botched bull rally is a result of Bitcoin failing to recapture the interest of the mainstream public it once had, and the lackluster launch of Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt exchange hints that institutional investors aren’t interested either.

The lack of demand, says one crypto analyst, could cause Bitcoin to fall below its previous bear market bottom set in December 2018 at $3,100.

The analyst cites the yearly chart for the BraveNewCoin Liquid Index for Bitcoin – a chart that dates back to the origin of the crypto asset, and gives the widest-angle long-term view of the asset’s growth trajectory.

According to the analyst and the yearly chart, $4,000 is the “only decent” support level until “sub-$3K.” However, the sub-$3K the analyst is speaking of is a support zone that lies another 90% below Bitcoin’s bear market bottom of $3,100, extending as low as $300 per BTC.

On the high end of the support zone would be the 2014 yearly open price of $800.

Irrational Call? Or Is a Lack of Fundamental Growth Hindering Bitcoin Demand?

However, its worth pointing out that calls for such lows are as irrational as calls for $100,000 Bitcoin during the 2019 parabolic rally. When traders – bullish or bearish – become exuberant and make unrealistic calls, it often signals a reversal is near.

Some of the best investors in history advocate taking a contrarian stance, suggesting that such a call is a great buy signal. However, the analyst also calls out a lack of fundamentals driving demand in the asset.

In a news release published on Oct. 21, Bitmain revealed the project had been completed together with the Rockdale Municipal Development District and Canadian technology firm DMG Blockchain Solutions.

Pledges to boost the local economy

The news release places a strong emphasis on working with the local economy of Rockdale, which is located in Milam County, east of Austin.

The facility — currently developed to a current 25MW capacity, with a 50MW facility remaining under construction — sits on a 33,000-acre site and can expand to a capacity of over 300MW in the future.

The site is reportedly owned by the Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa, and formerly served as the location for a smelter.

DMG, which is to provide hosting and management services for the Texas facility, will cooperate with Bitmain to expand the facility’s capacity and ensure the efficiency of the site’s mining operations.

Both firms will work closely to establish the facility’s on-ground team together with the local workforce commission, the Rockdale MDD.

Bitmain says it is committed to seeking local Rockdale suppliers to support the ongoing construction work and will also purchase energy directly from Rockdale’s electric grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Aside from supporting the local economy, Bitmain also plans to launch educational programs and training on blockchain technology and mining data center operations, together with the Rockdale school district.

“Significant” for Bitmain’s global expansion plans

As previously reported, Bitmain’s plans for its Texas site was first announced in Aug. 2018.

At the time, Bitmain said it expected to create 400 local jobs in the first two years, quoting $500 million as its total planned investment into the economy over an initial period of seven years.

This January, local reports alleged that the project was being downscaled, with reports of staff layoffs and suspended operations. Adverse market conditions were thought to be the reason for the purported cooling-off.

Clinton Brown, Rockdale Lead Project Manager for Bitmain, has today said the facility’s launch is “significant to Bitmain's global expansion plans” and that the state’s stable and efficient energy resources will be fundamental to supporting what he believes is set to be the inevitable scale of growth of the mining industry.",,https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/43950/bitmain-opens-a-large-crypto-mining-farm-in-texas,,,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitmain-launches-50mw-crypto-mining-farm-in-texas/,"Bitmain, the leading crypto mining hardware manufacturer, on Monday, announced the launch of a 50MW cryptocurrency mining farm in the US state of Texas.

Though the construction of the first phase is complete, Bitmain will continue to expand the facility to touch 50MW of capacity. In addition, the site has been designed to expand the mining operation up to 300MW.

To ensure efficient operations of the mining facility, alongside the expansion, DMG will be responsible for providing hosting and management services for the Texas facility. In addition, the Chinese giant will also work with local authorities to grow its on-ground team.

Bitmain also assured that it would procure materials for construction from the local suppliers in the area to contribute to the economy of the region.

“This mining facility marks a major milestone in the development of the mining farm industry. We are proud to partner with Bitmain, the leading innovator in this sector,” Sheldon Bennett, COO of DMG and in-charge of Rockdale mining facility, added.

As an Oct. 21 press release notes, Los Angeles-based Bitcoin IRA has provided digital asset individual retirement account (IRA) solutions since 2016 and processed over $350 million in investments, onboarding 4,000 clients.

Genesis Capital — a spin-off of over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency broker Genesis Global Trading — has reportedly now lent in excess of $2.3 billion in cumulative originations and reported a 75% upturn in crypto and cash loans in Q2 2019.

Interest earned can help offset fees

Bitcoin IRA COO, Chris Kline, has argued that adding interest-earning accounts to the firm’s crypto and cash lending program will help spur decentralized finance forward, claiming that:

“Borrowing and lending using cryptocurrencies and cash are providing new and safe opportunities for our clients to maximize the growth of their retirement accounts. Interest earned by a client can offset trading fees or custodial holding fees, essentially creating a free account making these fees a thing of the past.""

The first interest-earning accounts will reportedly be rolled out in November to a limited number of participants on a first-come, first-served basis. According to the firm, annual interest rates will vary based on the given coin and term length, with finalized details of the program to be announced in the future.

The press release notes that the new product follows Bitcoin IRA’s recent launch of crypto swaps and biometric security.

Qualified with U.S. regulator FinCEN, Bitcoin IRA’s technology supports self-directed retirement accounts that allow investors to create a digital asset IRA account, transfer funds from an existing IRA custodian and trade their crypto holdings in real-time via an OTC liquidity provider.

The firm collaborates with BitGo to provide clients with multi-signature digital wallets.

Adoption

As reported, the popularity of digital asset IRA accounts was in full swing in 2017, notwithstanding concerns over asset volatility.

Experienced traders have meanwhile advocated for the significant tax advantages of IRAs.

As reported, ahead of its Q2 success, Genesis processed a $425 million in loans in Q1 2019 and $553 million in the first six months of its operations following its March 2018 launch.

This January, its CEO said that the previous cryptocurrency bear market had certainly helped to fuel the growth of the company, in line with other crypto lenders’ experience.",,https://www.coindesk.com/binance-ceo-russian-ruble-to-be-first-fiat-crypto-trading-option,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is soon to launch its first fiat-to-cryptocurrency trading pairs.

Speaking at the Open Innovations 2019 conference in Moscow on Monday, CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao confirmed that fiat options are on the way, kicking off with the Russian ruble:

“We’re adding support for fiat trading. In about two weeks or so, we should have support for Russian ruble trading, direct.”

Until now, the company’s primary service, binance.com, has only supported crypto-to-crypto trading. However, it has launched local fiat gateways in Uganda, Singapore, Jersey and, most recently, the U.S.

Binance had said in September that fiat payments were coming for over-the-counter OTC trading – effectively, bulk deals – this month. However, his comments today appear to indicate that general trading on the exchange will also support the new options.

Also announced by the exchange on Monday, a new token pegged to the value of the bitcoin cash (BCH) cryptocurrency has been listed on its decentralized exchange, Binance DEX. Binance said its “BCH-1FD” token would bring more options for DEX users.

The Exodus 1S is a much cheaper device at €219 (around $244), and offers much less powerful hardware built around a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor.

The Exodus 1S’s big new cryptocurrency feature is that it’s able to run a full bitcoin node, which HTC says is a first for a smartphone. It’s something the company has been talking about wanting to do since the announcement of the original Exodus 1. Speaking to Forbes, HTC’s Phil Chen said that being able to run a full node means that the phone can relay, confirm, and validate bitcoin transactions, which offers more privacy and also allows you to contribute to the security of the network.

Running a full bitcoin node is not without its limitations

Running a full bitcoin node on a phone comes with its limitations. HTC recommends that you connect the phone to Wi-Fi and plug it into a power source while it’s running the full node, and you’ll also need to buy an SD card with a capacity of 400GB or more if you want the phone to be able to hold a full copy of the Bitcoin ledger. The Exodus 1S will also not be able to operate as a mining node.

Outside of its blockchain capabilities, the HTC Exodus 1S features entry-level hardware. It’s got a 5.7-inch HD display, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and it has a single rear-facing 13-megapixel camera. It charges over MicroUSB, but at least you get a 3.5mm headphone jack.

HTC’s Exodus phones are an ambitious attempt by the company to appeal to cryptocurrency enthusiasts as its smartphone sales have plummeted in recent years. Compared to the Exodus 1, the cheaper starting price of the Exodus 1S could make it appealing as a secondary device to experiment with.

The HTC Exodus 1S won’t be available in the US, but you can now order it from HTC’s site in Europe, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Naturally, HTC will happily accept payment in bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, Binance coin, and bitcoin cash for the phone.",2019-10-21,https://cointelegraph.com/news/unicef-fund-manager-cryptocurrency-could-revolutionize-humanitarian-aid,"When disaster strikes the swift delivery of aid often plays a massive role in preventing disease, exposure, and the pause in the delivery of essential services from exacerbating an already dire situation.

The abysmal response in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria pummeled the island in 2017 serves as a perfect example. In fact, data from a Harvard University study estimated that the delayed response in distributing aid contributed to an excess death count of 4,645, whereas the official death count by the government of Puerto Rico remains at 64.

First responders and organizations that deliver humanitarian aid realize that urgent action saves lives and for this reason they are always searching for ways to streamline their processes.

Cointelegraph recently reported that the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) had announced the launch of a cryptocurrency-backed fund aimed at supporting the development of open-source technology that benefits young people around the world. According to UNICEF the Cryptocurrency Fund will “hold and make transactions in cryptocurrency,” specifically Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

UNICEF said:

“Under the structure of the UNICEF Cryptocurrency Fund, contributions will be held in their cryptocurrency of contribution, and granted out in the same cryptocurrency.”

We’re naturally curious when any large government-backed organization openly embraces cryptocurrency, so, we reached out to Sunita Grote, Program Funding Manager for UNICEF Innovation, to learn more.

Note: This transcript has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

CoinTelegraph: Tell us a little about yourself and how you got into this space.

Sunita Grote: I’ve been with UNICEF innovation for 5 years. I co-founded and manage the fiat fund, where we make investments in startups that are working in the countries UNICEF operates in.

Prior to joining UNICEF, I worked in health programming for about 10 years and I saw the need for approaching health services and other social services that impact children in a new way. The Innovation Fund allows UNICEF to explore innovative financing and new technology solutions.

CT: Could you explain why UNICEF decided to partner with the Ethereum Foundation?

SG: We had a number of conversations with leading foundations and partners in the space. It was clear that the Ethereum Foundation is closely aligned with the objectives of our fund. They’re focused on developing solutions on public blockchains, and that was key to our partnership and finding common ground.

CT: Does UNICEF have any concerns about the potential anonymity of contributions to the Cryptocurrency Fund?

SG: At the moment, all contributions follow the standard know-your-customer (KYC) and due diligence processes that UNICEF uses for the contributions it receives in any currency. UNICEF National Committees in France, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA are currently able to accept donations. They are the primary recipients of cryptocurrency donations and they conduct the necessary screening processes.

Over time we will refine our process and hope to increase the number of national committees able to accept contributions in cryptocurrency, however we will not be accepting anonymous donations. All donations will be publicly visible as part of an ethos of transparency and accountability, to ensure all transactions are traceable from source to recipient.

CT: Will UNICEF hold cryptocurrency in the Cryptocurrency Fund, or will it just be a pipeline that immediately converts cryptocurrency back to government-issued currency?

SG: No, cryptocurrency-based donations will not be converted to government-backed currencies. The idea is to receive, hold, and disburse crypto as crypto. At no point in the process does it get converted into any other currency. This allows us to fully leverage the benefits that crypto offers.

We can track all transactions via the blockchain, and can see how recipients use the funds. Recipients have also agreed to not convert the funds into any other digital asset or government-backed currency. UNICEF appreciates that all transactions are stored in the blockchain, and this is part of the reason why we prefer to leave crypto as crypto.

CT: What are your thoughts about the inherent volatility of digital assets? Does this pose a risk to UNICEF operations?

SG: No, the volatility of cryptocurrency does not impact our operations because we are choosing to leave crypto as crypto, including in our financial statements, where cryptocurrency will be reported as crypto. Because there is no conversion, and because contributions in crypto are accounted for separately from other currencies, volatility doesn’t impede our ability to provide services.

CT: Will proceeds from the Cryptocurrency Fund go towards UNICEF's general operations, or will it be directed to a specific project?

SG: Currently, the application of crypto-based donations is limited to our Cryptocurrency Fund and contributions are used to support companies expanding their blockchain solutions. Right now cryptocurrency donations are not used to support the services that UNICEF traditionally provides for children. UNICEF selected and funded these companies based on their ability to provide services and technologies that generate value and good for those in need across the world.

Our innovation fund has made more than 70 investments, including a handful of blockchain and crypto-oriented companies from developing and emerging markets. Three of these companies have received a grant from the crypto fund, and will use it to expand and refine their platforms.

The recipient companies are Atix Labs in Argentina, Prescrypto in Mexico, and Utopixar in Tunisia.

CT: Looking beyond cryptocurrency as a source of revenue, what potential do you see for blockchain technology itself in contributing to UNICEF's mission?

SG: At UNICEF’s Office of Innovation we explore various technologies to see if and how various applications can benefit children. We have been exploring the use of blockchain for a few years, and there are three key benefits:

– It lets us tap into a new resource base for UNICEF and expand our network to receive contributions

– Blockchain can improve efficiency and transparency by tracking the flow of resources and transactions in a more transparent way. Blockchain makes us more accountable and has the potential to reduce the amount of resources we need to do our work. We’re a $7 billion global organization that conducts a lot of transactions between various parts of our organization, so we are looking to see how blockchain can help us manage and track these in a more efficient way.

– We are exploring how how blockchain can disrupt and improve systems that deliver programs for children. Blockchain may allow us to make payments in a new way and improve how cash transfers are made.

UNICEF is able to make these explorations and establish the Cryptocurrency Fund thanks to the collaboration across the organization of different teams, including finance, legal and other technical teams. In this way, we are exploring and leveraging the benefits of blockchain for the whole organization, and hope that the broader UN system will also benefit from these efforts.",

The love-in between smartphone developers and cryptocurrency users is smoldering. What started out as a flirtation by HTC and Samsung has blossomed into a full-blown affair, incorporating hardware and software support from a string of companies. Today, Opera ramped up its cryptocurrency support, integrating Bitcoin Core and Tron into its mobile browser wallet.

Opera Sings Crypto’s Praises

Cryptocurrency users awoke this morning to the news of another smartphone integration. Opera’s Android wallet now supports BTC and TRX, in addition to ETH, with the promise of iOS to come. As the developer explained, “All of Opera’s features, like the free unlimited VPN, the built-in ad blocker and Crypto Wallet, follow the same line of thinking – you should be able to access them as fast as possible … You can now choose to add a Bitcoin card to your wallet, making it possible to send and receive money from the web.”

With 350 million users, the browser’s support for Bitcoin and Tron is significant. In the case of the former, it provides censorship-resist money directly within the web browser, enabling BTC to be spent on third party websites that accept the cryptocurrency. Tron integration, meanwhile, will prove a boon for decentralized applications, supplying smartphone users with access to a panoply of apps that exist beyond the purview of the Apple or Google Play stores. Opera has been supporting crypto for some time, having incorporated Ethereum into Android browsers last year, and Apple iOS this spring. It was the first major browser to integrate a crypto wallet, enabling crypto payments to be securely made on sites directly within the mobile browser.

The Convergence of Crypto and Mobile

Mainstream crypto awareness and ultimately adoption appear a realistic prospect at this rate. Whereas in the past major tech companies merely flirted with blockchain, recent developments suggest a full-blown love affair in the making, with the end result likely to be a wider appreciation of cryptocurrency among smartphone users.

Facebook’s much-vaunted crypto payments system Libra could help in this respect. Although it’s a centralized protocol, it opens the possibility of a few billion monthly users exploring the topic more broadly, which can only be a good thing. Libra launches in 2020, so expect the hype train to keep rolling until then.

Zuckerberg’s big beast is not alone. Last month, popular Japanese messaging app Line launched Bitmax, an app-connected cryptocurrency exchange boasting five assets: BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC and XRP. Staying in Asia, Taiwanese electronics firm HTC has unveiled its new Exodus 1s handset equipped with a built-in hardware wallet to hold crypto. Unlike its predecessor Exodus 1, the 1s runs a full Bitcoin node – the first smartphone to do so. This means that users can contribute more fully to the security of the ecosystem and verify their own transactions.

The Budget Blockchain Phone

The Exodus 1s is a device tailored for crypto devotees rather than neophytes, and barriers to entry are lowered from a cost perspective also: it’s just $250, a major reduction on the Exodus’ $700 outlay. Paradoxically, some geographical barriers remain: the device is only available in Europe, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with more locations to be announced in future.

The convergence of bitcoin and smartphone wallets certainly makes it easier for individuals to spend their chosen cryptocurrency and interact with decentralized applications (dapps) on the go. Just last month, HTC announced that its original Exodus 1 handset would start supporting Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through its partnership with Bitcoin.com, in a collaboration that has seen the Bitcoin.com Wallet preloaded on the handset.

Of course, HTC is not the only mobile platform which is touting crypto-centric handsets. Samsung has been blazing the trail for a while, and its Galaxy S10 now supports 18 dapps and over 30 cryptocurrencies including BTC, ETH and HT. Millions will soon be able to use bitcoin with apps via the Blockchain Wallet Samsung has started including on its flagship handsets this year.

Can we expect more mobile giants to enter the crowded cryptosphere? Absolutely. In fact, they’re already mobilizing: Apple released a cryptographic software called CryptoKit for iOS 13 in June, and LG have hinted at their own crypto wallet by trademarking “ThinQ Wallet.”

These tech companies aren’t operating in silos, either: several have come together to create a government-backed blockchain network that will allow citizens to ditch hard copies of important documents in favor of a blockchain-powered mobile solution. As well as LG and Samsung, the consortium includes financial IT company Koscom and South Korea’s Shinhan Bank.

The days of spending cryptocurrency solely on desktop, or locking it away in hardware wallets, destined never to be spent, are over. There’s no obligation to spend crypto of course – it’s yours to use or store as you see fit. At least now, thanks to the efforts of smartphone developers, you have the option to deploy your digital assets on the web and on the go.

Do you think smartphone integration of cryptocurrency will lead to broader adoption? Let us know in the comments section below.

This means Opera users can now carry out Bitcoin transactions directly in the browser without needing any extensions or following any other complex processes.

The Norwegian company first teased a crypto wallet for its Android app last July in private beta, before launching it to the public in December — making it the first of the major browsers to support cryptocurrencies natively. The company later expanded support to Opera on the desktop app and on iPhone.

Opera’s crypto wallet had until now only supported Ethereum, a lower-profile Bitcoin alternative, but back in July the company announced plans to support both Bitcoin and the Tron cryptocurrency and blockchain. They had been available in beta, but with today’s news both crypto networks are now officially supported in the main Opera Android app.

This launch follows a trend of big tech companies embracing blockchain. Earlier this week, HTC launched the Exodus 1s blockchain smartphone, which also comes bundled with Opera. Facebook too is making moves in the cryptocurrency sphere with Libra, though global regulatory scrutiny has led many of its initial partners to jump ship ahead of the planned 2020 launch.

As the original blockchain and cryptocurrency poster child, Bitcoin is a notable addition to Opera’s cypto wallet. With some 350 million users across all platforms, Opera is potentially bringing the popular cryptocurrency to the global masses, simply by making it more accessible.

“With this release, Opera opens its crypto wallet to the world’s most popular blockchain, making it possible to send and receive BTC directly from the browser the way one would an image or a music file,” the company wrote in a blog post. “This means anyone can now not only send Bitcoin and Ethereum to another person, but can also use it while interacting with websites to pay for goods or services.”

It’s worth noting that while Opera has limited its Bitcoin expansion to Android for now, we can likely expect support to land on other Opera platforms in the future — its recent launch history has shown that it usually starts with Android, followed by desktop, and then iOS.",2019-10-22 00:00:00,https://decrypt.co/10651/opera-web-browser-adds-support-for-bitcoin-and-tron,"Opera, a leading web browser, announced today the integration for Bitcoin and Tron wallets directly in its browser. This follows the integration of an Ethereum crypto wallet and dapp support last year.

Though it is already possible to use third-party services to access dapps and wallets within browsers, like the Google Chrome extension Moon, which lets Amazon customers pay with crypto, or Metamask, which lets you run dApps straight in your browser, Opera cuts straight to the chase. Customers can now use Bitcoin, Tron and Ethereum to pay for things in crypto.

Opera’s integration of the TRON wallet ends a beta that started back in summer. Opera users can also access dApps, providing them access to a variety of applications that exist outside of the Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. According to research by TheNextWeb earlier this year, 95 percent of activity on the TRON network was for gambling sites.

“Through social networking, gaming and entertainment, TRON is moving on all cylinders to unite the cryptocurrency community and bring blockchain to everyone,” said Ryan Dennis, head of marketing at TRON.

Opera announced earlier this year that users can buy Ethereum straight from wallets integrated into its browser, part of a partnership with Swedish crypto brokerage Safello. The service, though, is only available in Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.

And a few months before that, in a public release in December 2018, Opera announced support for ERC-20 tokens and crypto collectibles, like CryptoKitties. Opera’s crypto-ready mobile browser, the Opera Touch browser, is also available for iOS devices.

Crypto browsers

This makes Opera one of the only major browsers to have native crypto support. On Chrome and Safari browsers, users have to use third-party crypto extensions to access decentralised services.

Opera’s main competitor in the crypto space is the privacy browser, Brave. Brave rewards users in BAT tokens for watching advertisements, a move it says cuts down on intrusive advertising practises. Brave announced earlier this month it had reached 8 million monthly users, and proposed a new type of decentralized, crypto-enhanced VPN.

Other leaders in the crypto industry, including exchanges Coinbase and Binance, have either released or are working on mobile dapp browsers that integrate crypto wallets.

The addition of new features, part of Android 54, continues Opera’s advancement into new services. Opera offers a free VPN, built-in ad blocker, and integrated messenger, and has also overhauled the design of its Android app.",2019-10-22 10:39:10,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/fraudulent-transactions-in-crypto-explained,"2. Tell me more — what are the most common ways to be tricked?

Exchanges, businesses, wallets and people that aren’t what they say they are.

For example, there might be a crypto exchange that looks like it offers fantastic rates and low fees on the trading fees you use the most. But, once you have made a deposit, it could be almost impossible to withdraw your funds. Another risk is entrusting your assets with a platform that has inadequate security measures in place. Just look at Mt. Gox — an astounding 850,000 BTC was lost all the way back in 2014, and those who were left out of pocket are still fighting to be reunited with their funds. Due diligence is essential — and even positive reviews found on crypto forums and social networks should be taken with a grain of salt.

Ponzi schemes are particularly disastrous because the number of victims can grow exponentially. Investors in these scams are normally under pressure to recruit as many others as possible to ensure that their profits rise. Indeed, they may even get a few payments to begin with — meaning those being duped often fully believe that they have stumbled across a real business opportunity. Ponzi schemes usually collapse when the pool of new recruits runs dry.

Phony crypto wallets are another issue. Apps posing as official wallets for NEO, Tether and MetaMask have been uncovered on the Google Play Store before now — and alarmingly, it seems they had hundreds of installs. The apps often requested a user’s private key and wallet password, sensitive personal data that would subsequently be used by cybercriminals to steal even more money. Other malicious pieces of software have piggybacked on reputable crypto wallet brands like Trezor.

Then, there are fake mainstream news articles and “official” social media pages that aim to capture crypto consumers who may have very little experience of the market. We’ve seen fraudulent investment opportunities that have claimed to have the endorsement of A-listers such as Elon Musk, Kate Winslet and Richard Branson — with Dutch billionaire John De Mol going as far to sue Facebook after the public lost an estimated $1.9 million falling for crypto ads that featured his image.

Facebook has even been a target itself, with fake pages on its social networks claiming to be official entities for the upcoming Libra cryptocurrency. They offered the chance for consumers to supposedly buy the stablecoin at heavily discounted prices, even though they hadn’t been launched.",2019-10-22 19:09:00+01:00,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-extortion-on-the-rise-says-academic-study,"Crypto-based extortion – basically the process of using spam-flinging botnet armies to “ransom” dirty pictures and compromising information in exchange for bitcoin – has turned virtual crime into child’s play.

Speaking this week at the Advances in Financial Technology conference in Zurich, an international team comprised of researchers from the Austrian Technology Institute and security provider GoSecure sampled a population of email spam and found that the extortion process was quick, easy, and very lucrative.

Using public data hack info, the researchers found that a single instance of the popular Necurs botnet launched over 80 campaigns and in the 4.3 million emails surveyed by the team. In almost all cases the criminals had no incriminating information on the victims.

The team said that the botnet was surprisingly lucrative. By renting a botnet for $10,000 per month, the extortionists have been making at least $130,000. Compared to most extortion schemes, the spam campaign is incredibly simple, largely due to its employment of cryptocurrencies, said GoSecure’s Masarah Paquet-Clouston.

As such, the researchers expect crypto-backed email extortions to increase.

“If you look at traditional [product] spam, it’s much more complicated … [crypto] extortion spam is much simpler,” Paquet-Clouston said.

Examples provided in the paper describe an email informing the victim that the hacker will release compromising personal information if bitcoin isn’t provided in a timely manner. For example, one email claimed the hackers were performing surveillance via malware:

“Hello! As you may have noticed, I sent you an email from your account. This means that I have full access to your account. I’ve been watching you for a few months now. The fact is that you were infected with malware through an adult site that you visited.”

Tracking the bitcoin addresses used and languages employed in emails allowed the researchers to further understand how botnets operate. For instance, whoever was behind the botnet charged certain nationalities higher prices than others, with English speakers topping out around $745 per recipient compared to Spaniards on the lowest end at $249.

The botnet reused bitcoin addresses, backing up similar research which saw one address used 3 million times. The researchers speculate address re-use is employed to increase the tactics overall simplicity.

Only 0.135 percent of bitcoin extorted could be traced to publicly verifiable wallets on exchanges, signifying the use of CoinJoins and other measures to mask transactions before off-ramping funds into fiat currency.

Knowledge about bitcoin and methods to track payments have lead botnet campaigns to other cryptos, the team said, particularly litecoin. Counterintuitively, privacy coins like monero and zcash are not being heavily used.

Hacker image via Shutterstock",2019-10-23 04:00:23+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/fiat-to-crypto-carry-trade-may-tempt-traders-tired-of-negative-interest-rates,"With the era of negative interest rates well and truly here, return-hungry investors may increasingly borrow in low-interest fiat currencies and invest in higher-yielding cryptocurrency accounts.

“The fiat-BTC carry trade is the next step in bitcoin growth,” tweeted popular bitcoin quant investor @100trillionUSD on Oct. 10.

A carry trade is a strategy where a trader uses a low-yielding currency to fund a high-yielding investment.

For instance, the yen carry trade was popular in 2004-2008 when the Federal Reserve hiked rates from 1 percent to 5.25 percent and interest rates in Japan were stuck near 0.5 percent.

Investors borrowed in yen to fund dollar-denominated investments. As a result, the yen weakened by 20 percent against the U.S. dollar.

Currently, the carry trade in the FX markets is pretty much dead with almost every advanced nation having interest rates at or below zero.

But that situation bodes well for a new type of carry trade with a crypto twist.

Lucrative lending…

On the lending side, crypto-asset platforms like Binance, Crypto.com, Celsius Network, BlockFi are paying interest rates on cryptocurrency deposits. They fund this with interest earned from credit lines extended to margin traders and hedgers.

The interest rates are subject to fluctuations, either modified by the platform operator or influenced by the supply-demand mechanics of users interacting with the platform.

For instance, the Bitfinex exchange pays an annual interest rate of 0.66 percent interest on bitcoin deposits and provides loans at 0.59 percent, according to CoinMarketCap’s new Interest tracker.

In a sense, Bitfinex is operating as a commercial bank by charging a higher rate on loans and paying relatively less on deposits. (Think of the old 3-6-3 rule: “borrow at 3 percent, lend at 6 percent, hit the golf course at 3” – except unlike a bank, crypto exchanges never close.)

While Bitfinex is offering 0.66 percent, other platforms are paying significantly higher interest rates on bitcoin deposits, as seen in the chart below.

One possible reason for the disparity is that like a demand deposit at a bank, Bitfinex allows customers to withdraw at any time, whereas other crypto platforms require the money to be locked up for a period for weeks or months. Crypto.com, for instance, is paying 6 percent, but deposits need to be maintained at least for 90 days.

Then again, BlockFi also allows withdrawals any time (it even removed an early withdrawal penalty, allowing one free withdrawal per month) and it is offering an annual interest rate of 6.20 percent.

Meanwhile, crypto lending provider Nexo is offering up to 8 percent yield on deposits of stablecoins DAI, USD Coin (USDC), Paxos Standard (PAX), TrueUSD (TUSD) and Tether (USDT). Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar.

…and cheap borrowing

The annual interest rates paid by crypto lending platforms are significantly higher than the rates across the advanced world, as seen below.

Central banks in Europe and Japan are running a negative interest rate policy (NIRP), under which financial institutions are required to pay an interest rate for parking excess reserves with the central bank.

The Swiss National Bank, which introduced negative rates in 2015, currently has the lowest rate in the world at -0.75 percent. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) cut rates to -0.1 percent in January 2016 and has been running the negative interest rate policy ever since.

The yield of -0.12 percent seen on the 10-year Japanese government bond is the side effect of BOJ’s market-distorting policies.

Also, corporate debt yields have recently hit unprecedented lows. For instance, Toyota Finance Corp will be issuing three-year notes at an unprecedented low yield of 0.0000000091 percent, according to Bloomberg. It means a trader buying 1 billion yen of the bonds would not even make 1 yen on maturity.

The situation is somewhat better for investors in the U.S. and U.K., where the target short-term rates set by the central bank stand at 1.75 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively. The benchmark 10-year government bond yields, however, are significantly lower than the interest rates paid by the likes of Nexo and Celsius Network.

More importantly, central banks running NIRP are unlikely to normalize their policy anytime soon, given the bleak outlook for the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently slashed its 2019 global growth forecast to 6 percent – the lowest since 2008.

All-in-all, interest rates across the globe are low and could slide further, boosting the allure of high-yielding crypto deposits.

Halving factor

Aside from the interest rate differential, there’s another reason borrowing fiat to buy bitcoin could pay off.

In May of next year, the amount of new bitcoin awarded to miners every 10 minutes or so will be cut in half for the third time in the cryptocurrency’s history. Historically, reward halvings have boded well for bitcoin’s price.

The next halving could reduce the amount of new bitcoin added to the market by $51 million per week at current prices, according to Alistair Milne, chief investment officer of Altana Digital Currency Fund.

As of writing, BTC is trading above $8,200, representing 120 percent gains on a year-to-date basis.

And, if the carry trade becomes popular, all else equal BTC should appreciate sharply against the USD, the way the greenback did against the Japanese Yen.

Cashaa’s Banking Solution

U.K.-based online banking platform Cashaa announced Monday that it will start enabling users to buy cryptocurrencies with INR on Oct. 23. The company explained that “While access to crypto in India through banking no longer exists, Cashaa was able to find a solution,” elaborating:

On the occasion of Diwali, an Indian festival for wealth and prosperity, Cashaa will be enabling INR deposits and purchases of crypto in India for Indian residents, up to 1 crore INR per month.

Cashaa cofounder Janina Lowisz confirmed to news.Bitcoin.com on Tuesday that “people can buy BTC, ETH and our own token CAS with INR so far,” noting that BCH will be added by Christmas.

To access Cashaa’s banking services, users need to have the platform’s native token. “We will enable this [buy crypto with INR] service for Indian residents who have at least 2,500 CAS in their Cashaa wallet,” CEO Kumar Gaurav said earlier this month. The coin, currently trading at $0.008, can be used to pay for services and fees on the platform.

Founded in June 2016, Cashaa currently offers personal and business accounts. A large number of its users are in India, the company revealed. Its services allow users to purchase cryptocurrencies using credit or debit cards, deposit funds via bank transfer in over 200 countries, and withdraw funds in users’ local currency. In addition, the company claims that its “crypto-friendly bank accounts have received a huge demand including more than 700 business signups, many of which are in the process of onboarding.”

Banking Restrictions and Regulatory Uncertainty

Cashaa explained that it has been working to provide a solution to users in India ever since the RBI banned financial institutions from providing services to businesses dealing in cryptocurrencies. The ban went into effect in July last year and banks subsequently closed accounts of crypto exchanges, forcing some of them to shut down. Several writ petitions have been filed with the country’s supreme court to challenge the ban. The court is scheduled to resume hearing the case on Nov. 19.

A number of crypto exchanges responded to the RBI ban by launching exchange-escrowed peer-to-peer (P2P) trading. Bitcoin.com also has a P2P marketplace for bitcoin cash available to users in India.

Meanwhile, a bigger issue is looming in India — the legal framework for cryptocurrency. A draft bill that seeks to ban all cryptocurrencies except state-issued ones is being considered by the Indian government, which has told the supreme court that this bill may be introduced in the next session of parliament. However, many people in the Indian crypto community believe that the bill is flawed and are heavily campaigning to convince the government to reevaluate the recommendations in the bill.

Forbes reported Back’s remarks on Oct. 21, noting that he is also the co-author of the “Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains” paper about Bitcoin sidechains released about five years ago. In the document, he and his fellow researchers first expressed the idea that Bitcoin’s sidechains will have substantial advantages over altcoins.

It is worth mentioning that Back’s Blockstream is the company that launched the Liquid Bitcoin sidechain. In July, Blockstream also launched a new tool that allows users to execute atomic swaps for all assets supported by the Liquid network.

Bitcoin sidechains to decrease altcoin pull

During the aforementioned conference, Back explained that — despite five years already passing since the sidechains proposal — he still believes that Bitcoin’s sidechains will diminish the appeal of altcoins in the long run. He also gave his own take on the evolution of altcoin development:

“In the history of altcoins, it seemed like there was a period where there were a huge number of them that had no features. [...] And that played out. And then people started to need a new way to market them, so they added features. Some of them were real features, and some of them were stories to market [their altcoins].”

Back explained that sidechains could bring the features of altcoins to Bitcoin, but that economic incentives decrease the motivation to develop such systems.

Creating an altcoin is simply more profitable than developing a sidechain with no new crypto asset. Still, he also foresees some changes to take place after sidechains become more viable than they currently are:

“This financial incentive will remain, but it will have less credibility because if you have a very easy to use extension mechanism for Bitcoin and examples of extensions that do something simple that you can build on, there’s not really a good story about why you’re doing it somewhere else.”

Trustless, secure sidechains still ways off

He also noted that his ideas do not only apply to sidechains but to every second-layer solution built on top of Bitcoin, such as scalability solution Lightning Network. Nevertheless, he admits that current sidechain solutions are still not trustless or secure enough.

Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra previously expressed the idea that bleeding edge cryptography Zero-Knowledge Proofs may eventually enable better sidechains. Back also touched the subject but said that such implementations could still need a few years of development. He said:

“That’s an enormous proof, and all of the current proof systems are orders of magnitude away from being able to do that, and some of them make experimental security assumptions. [...] Maybe the bulletproof-like security and scalability will improve enough, and then we can make general, fully-secure sidechains just by having the main chain block verify a list of them. That would be very nice.”

As Cointelegraph recently reported, almost $77 million of Bitcoin is currently locked in the network’s sidechains.",,https://www.coindesk.com/why-bitmain-is-building-the-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mine-in-rural-texas,"The Takeaway

Bitmain, the world’s largest maker of bitcoin-mining computers, chose an old Alcoa aluminum-smelting plant in Rockdale, Texas, for a new bitcoin mine.

The Beijing company says the plant has an initial power size of 25 megawatts but will be expanded to 50 megawatts and potentially 300 megawatts.

Texas has an abundance of power resources, so the new plant is unlikely to affect local electricity prices, say officials.

ROCKDALE, TEXAS – In the concrete-and-iron shell of a mostly-abandoned Alcoa aluminum smelter, Chinese and Canadian executives in business suits mingled with local residents in cowboy hats and baseball caps.

They assembled, just outside the town of Rockdale, in the central-Texas countryside, to celebrate the opening of a new bitcoin-mining plant constructed by Beijing-based Bitmain, the world’s largest manufacturer of computers designed to mine cryptocurrency.

County Judge Steve Young, the top elected official in rural Milam County, kneeled to snap photos. Tao Wu, an Arizona-based Bitmain executive sporting a thin bolo tie, gave a tour to curious local residents and journalists, shouting over the whirring of thousands of cooling fans.

“There’s going to be jobs, there’s going to be revenue,” Rockdale Mayor John King told the entourage during a ribbon-cutting ceremony. “We’re going to see great things coming in the future.”

Many of the locals on the tour had little if any idea how bitcoin mining worked, or even what bitcoin was.

“How do I monetize that?” said one person on the tour. “It’s not tangible.”

Texas, long known for its bountiful commodities, from cotton to crude oil, is now drawing a new breed of speculators in search of bitcoin, invented just a decade ago.

Bitmain says its operation in the state, which is flush with cheap electricity and plenty of space, represents an alluring opportunity – especially after prices for the cryptocurrency more than doubled this year to about $8,200.

In 2018, the company inked a deal with local officials to set up a bank of computers inside the Alcoa plant to mine bitcoin. Thousands of processing units run 24 hours a day, sending trillions of numbers per second via the Internet to mine bitcoin. The configuration has roughly the height and width of a railroad boxcar but extends in length for three football fields.

Bitmain declined to disclose the cost to build its new facility or the total bitcoin that it will produce. It did reveal that the plant during its initial phase will use 25 megawatts of electricity, the same amount as about 20,000 average U.S. households. The company says it plans to build out the plant to use 50 megawatts, and that eventually capacity could reach 300 megawatts, making it the world’s largest bitcoin mine.

Cryptocurrency-industry officials familiar with the technology say a 50-megawatt bitcoin mine would cost about $80 million to $100 million to build. Using the rated specifications on Bitmain’s Antminer S17 Pro mining computers, along with the website CryptoCompare’s mining profitability calculator, the Rockdale facility could generate an estimated $73 million of revenue per year, based on current prices. The only main input for these mines is electricity, and among U.S. states, Texas has the fourth-lowest power costs for industrial customers, according to government data.

The project was initiated last year, then shelved in early-2019 after bitcoin prices tumbled roughly 75 percent from their 2018 highs. As prices rebounded this year, Bitmain rushed to start up production.

“Once the price turned around, we ramped up,” says Clint Brown, 54, a former construction contractor, who now serves as a Bitmain project manager. “And it was like, ‘hurry up, we need to get this done.’”

The new Texas facility is Bitmain’s largest-ever mining project to date, the company’s managing director for marketing, Bill Zhu, said in an interview under a shady tree outside the nearby Rockdale Country Club. The company’s signature product is its line of Antminer computers. Officials said the new Rockdale site is named Dory Creek, after the ant genus Dorylus, which includes driver ants from southern Africa.

Zhu responded to a concern expressed by some local residents that the new facility might quickly be shuttered if the bitcoin market suffers a downturn; people in these parts are all too familiar with commodity cycles.

“We really can find some good resources in North America, and then we pick up Texas, and we think these resources are good enough to invest in for the long term,” he said, adding:

“Our investment is not so sensitive to the bitcoin price. We don’t care so much how much it is next month. We care three years from now how much it is.”

The project has caused a stir in Rockdale (population: 5,595) which was hit hard in late-2008 when the giant Alcoa smelting facility closed down, leading to the loss of more than a thousand jobs.

On Friday morning, a group of former Alcoa workers assembled for morning coffee and breakfast at Lee’s Landing, a diner where the walls are adorned with country implements including a pitchfork and set of stirrups. A sign in the bathroom reads, “Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he will sit in a boat and drink all day.”

Locals skeptical

One of the men at Lee’s, Royce Hudson, 73, said he got out of the Marines in November 1967, returning to central Texas and a job at the Alcoa smelter. He worked there for the next four decades, becoming a furnace operator, until he retired in 2008 when the facility closed, he said.

These days, he laments the fate of the local community, where the next generation is finding jobs harder to come by, and many people endure long commutes to work in Austin, Round Rock, Temple and Bryan-College Station.

Hudson says he’s happy that Bitmain is investing in the community, though he admits to knowing very little about what they do: “People are a little skeptical, because nobody really understands how it works,” he says, declining to have his coffee refilled. “We’re just not technically advanced enough.”

One of his former colleagues from the plant remarked that he couldn’t understand why there was nothing shipping out of the new plant, in the way that aluminum ingots used to issue forth from the old smelter.

The reality is that bitcoin mines represent a new type of industrial facility, with a glaring absence of heavy machinery and spewing little to no pollution, aside from the sizable emissions from the associated power generation. The output — the mined bitcoin — is delivered virtually, and almost instantaneously.

In some other states where bitcoin mining projects have gone in, including Washington, residents have complained that their monthly electricity bills shot up because of the added demand on the local grid.

Texas, by contrast, has a big enough electricity market — the biggest in the U.S. — that it can absorb new users. The state’s total annual power consumption is more than 50 percent higher than that of second-place California, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Cheap power

Power prices are held in check by the state’s abundant local supply of natural gas, used to fuel generators, as well as by the relative isolation of the state’s electric-transmission network from the rest of the nation’s, on a grid known as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. For the most part, whatever gets generated in the state, stays in the state. It doesn’t hurt that most Texas cities and towns feature a competitive electricity market, so businesses and households can shop around for a good deal.

Greg Pendley, president of CGP Solutions, a Houston-based energy consultant who helps big wholesale power purchasers find suppliers, says he often arranges deals for governments where the contract size can range from 5 megawatts to 8 megawatts. His point was that the Bitmain account is quite large.

The project has another unique attribute, he noted: “100 percent load.” Unlike some factories or government offices that might throttle back on power usage at night, when workers go off shift, Bitmain’s computers are constantly working.

“With this kind of industry, they’re looking for bitcoin, so they don’t make money if they’re not running,” Pendley said in an interview at the plant, where he joined the tour.

The facilities are light on employment compared with big factories or auto-assembly plants whose personnel can easily run into the thousands. Bitmain currently operates the Rockdale mine with a staff of fewer than 50 people.

“Once you get it up and running, it doesn’t take that many guys,” says Sheldon Bennett, chief operating officer of the Canadian company DMG Blockchain Solutions, which manages the new plant under a contract with Bitmain.

King, the mayor, said in an interview that the project looked pretty good to him, even after Bitmain won tax abatements from the county government.

It’s all in the name of economic development — a well-honed instinct in a business-friendly state like Texas that has never been shy about monetizing its natural resources for profit.

“If they’re housing people locally, and they’re shopping locally, we’re going to benefit,” King says. “It’s the first step in trying to regrow our economy.”

Investors are still speculating about the cause of the crash, but hopeful cryptocurrency bulls before today had hoped that $8,000 would be the new floor for Bitcoin.

No longer. Today the price of Bitcoin dropped to $7,448.75, down from around $8,000 earlier in the day.

Investors aren’t sure what’s behind the crash, but Bitcoin’s commentariat pointed to two likely culprits.

One was the underwhelming performance of Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in testimony before Congress on the Libra cryptocurrency that his company is leading the charge to create.

However, an underwhelming performance from Zuckerberg and the potential fate of Libra, which cryptocurrency purists have scoffed at anyway, may be less concerning for the Bitcoin crowd than developments happening in Google’s quantum computing research labs around the world.

Earlier today, Google declared quantum dominance, indicating that it had solved a problem using quantum computing that a supercomputer would have taken years to solve. That’s great news for theoretical physicists and quantum computing aficionados, but less good for investors who’ve put their faith (and billions of dollars) into a system of record whose value depends on its inability to be cracked by computing power.

When news of Google’s achievement first began trickling out in late September (thanks to reporting by the Financial Times), Bitcoin experts dismissed the notion that it would cause problems for the cryptocurrency.

“We still don’t even know if it’s possible to scale quantum computers; quite possible that adding qbits will have an exponential cost,” wrote early Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, on Twitter.

It means nothing because Google's quantum breakthrough is for a primitive type of quantum computing that is nowhere near breaking cryptography. We still don't even know if it's possible to scale quantum computers; quite possible that adding qbits will have an exponential cost. https://t.co/wSmO6ycaJk — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) September 24, 2019

The comments, flagged by CoinTelegraph, seem to indicate that the economic cost of cracking Bitcoin’s cryptography is far beyond the means of even Alphabet’s multibillion-dollar budgets.

Still, it has been a dark few months for cryptocurrencies after steadily surging throughout the year. The real test, of course, of the viability of Bitcoin and the other cryptographically secured transaction mechanisms floating around the tech world these days is whether anyone will build viable products on their open architectures.

Aside from a few flash-in-the-pan fads, the jury is very much still out on what the verdict will be.

That uncertainty affects more than just Bitcoin, and, indeed, the rest of the market also tumbled, as Coindesk pricing charts indicate.",2019-10-23,https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-likely-reasons-why-bitcoin-price-crashed-and-whats-next-for-btc,"The moment many traders have anxiously anticipated arrived this morning as Bitcoin price (BTC) plunged below $7,800 and eventually settled near $7,400. It’s possible that the bleeding isn’t over yet and investors will likely wait for the 4-hour and daily close before making any strong moves.

Many traders anticipated a decisive move occurring sooner than later simply based on the fact that Bitcoin has been bouncing around in the $7,800 to $8,300 range since Sept. 26 and the digital asset’s consistent failure to sustain above $8,200 to $8,300 suggested that momentum was waning.

Let’s explore several reasons that caused the price of Bitcoin to suddenly plunge today.

1. Technicals: support finally gives after 9th try

Since dropping from $9,500 on Sept. 24, Bitcoin has dropped below $7,800 on eight separate occasions and today’s price dump is the ninth. So from a technical point of view, Bitcoin was already biased towards bears on the short-term timeframe and this bias has also steadily increased on the longer time frames.

Today’s price dump liquidated $200 million worth of leveraged longs at BitMEX. According to twitter analyst “taiwandan” the Bitcoin liquidation at BitMEX could have begun with a 3,600 BTC sale at Bitstamp. Taiwandan said that “every bid from $7,800 to $6,200 wiped out in less than 15 minutes.”

Data from TradingView also shows that price dramatically fell at Bitstamp shortly before cascading significant price drops occurred at other major exchanges.

Interestingly, data from Skew also showed that open interest was coming close to a multi-month high of 110,000 BTC ($900 million) and this figure peaked one hour before the dump occurred.

2. Mr. Zuckerberg goes to Washington

Similar to traditional markets, the crypto sector is heavily influenced by media and it’s possible that recent news might have exacerbated the shock to Bitcoin’s price.

Today, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is testifying before U.S. lawmakers about the Libra project, political ads, and the proliferation of fake news on the platform. It seems every time the U.S. Congress discusses cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s price drops.

Adding to the fear, on Oct. 22, U.S. congresswoman Sylvia Garcia presented a draft bill proposing that all stablecoin be categorized as securities. If passed into law, all stablecoins and their issuers would fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

3. Google’s quantum breakthrough spooks Bitcoin investors?

Additional news that could be impacting Bitcoin’s price is Google’s announcement that a quantum computing breakthrough has enabled one of its machines to carry out tasks that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years to execute.

Quantum computers solving complex algorithms seem to make investors nervous that the Bitcoin network is under threat and it’s possible that some crypto investors jumped ship as the story circulated through the New York Times, Bloomberg and crypto media.

Clearly, a lot is happening during a short time span and this is weighing on Bitcoin’s price. Let’s take a brief look at the charts to see what might happen next.

BTC price double top hinted at today’s drop

Bitcoin formed a double top at $8,312 and this was a sign that a reversal was on the cards. Previously, bulls defended $7,800 and buyers consistently stepped in to prevent the price from dipping below this point.

But today’s sell-off broke through the $7,800 and $7,500 support. The 111 Daily Moving Average (DMA) still appears en route to cross below the 128 DMA and today’s downside break pulled the price far below the 20-MA of the Bollinger Band indicator.

BTC USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

Prior to the break, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator was trending upward on the daily time frame whereas Bitcoin price had descended since Oct. 11.

One could also argue that the head and shoulders pattern on the daily was completed and repeated failure to break above $8,300 increased the chance that BTC price would take the southern route.

To reverse the trend, bulls need to push the price to $8,225, $8,600 and $8,800 to set a higher high. The $8,600 mark also aligns with the upper arm of the Bollinger Band indicator and above the $8,200 to $8,400 resistance zone. Then the volume profile visible range shows open-air until $9,300, which would also place price above the 111 and 128-DMA.

Telltale signs of today’s drop were a tightening range over the past 3 weeks, decreasing volume and a bearish weekly MACD and (Relative Strength Index) RSI.

Day traders will attempt to play both sides of Bitcoin’s interim chop, while swing traders are likely licking their chops and eyeballing the 50% Fibonacci retracement on the weekly time frame as it is this price point that has three things going for it:

Some traders have pointed to the importance of variations (100, 111, 128, 200) of the weekly moving averages; this could be a make it or break it point for Bitcoin.

BTC USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview

The 50% Fibonacci retracement level is an important point with support reaching all the way back to March 26, 2018. BTC spent a lot of time in the $6,000 to $6,500 zone so a drop to this level could serve as strong support.

BTC USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview

The VPVR also shows demand at the $6,000 to $6,500 zone so it could at least provide a strong oversold bounce or two for interim traders, and if price settles in this region investors will be looking to open leveraged longs from this price.

Across multiple time frames Bitcoin appears to be in bear territory but some traders see a silver lining in the current scenario.

For example, veteran trader and crypto analyst Scott Melker hinted that the 4-hour chart appears to suggest a reversal could be in order. Melker identifies a possible bullish divergence taking place on the 4-hour and daily timeframe.

BTC USD 4-hr chart. Source: Tradingview

BTC USD daily chart. Source: Tradingview

If Bitcoin price can find support at $7,300 to $7,400 after a few 4-hour candle closes, traders may be induced to re-enter long positions. The 4-hour chart also shows that the RSI and Stoch RSI are deeply oversold so an oversold bounce could be in play before the daily candle closes.

Ultimately, similar drops in Bitcoin price occurred at $12,500, $9,400, $8,300 and now $8,000.

Often, BTC price seemingly settles on the 4-hour timeframe before plummeting even harder so traders are advised to approach with caution and wait for further confirmation that a bottom has been reached before making their move.

The total crypto market capitalization has broken below the $209 billion mark from where it had bounced on two previous occasions in late September. It has psychological support at $200 billion and below this point the total market capitalization could drop to $170 billion.

At the moment, there is not a direct reason that explains today’s strong correction. Some analysts believe that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony before the United States Congress on Libra might have triggered the fall. They believe that the stiff opposition to Libra shows that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will not be able to mainstream easily.

While there is no clear reason on the fundamental front, the technical picture was pointing to a large breakout or a breakdown because Bitcoin had been stuck in a tight range for the past few days. We were expecting a breakout to the upside but the markets had other plans. Once the support at $7,702.87 cracked, it would have triggered several stop losses resulting in a long liquidation, which extended the fall.

During the current decline, most major cryptocurrencies have either broken down from their support levels or are very close to them. While a breakdown is a significant event, we will watch whether the bears are able to sustain the lower levels or if the price snaps right back quickly.

If the price can quickly reverse direction and swiftly climb higher, it will indicate that the current fall was a bear trap – a last shake out before a new rally begins. Hence, the next three days are critical as it will provide us an insight on what to expect.

Let’s analyze the cryptocurrencies and determine whether the critical support levels have broken down or not.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin’s price action has repeated a similar pattern that it followed in late September. After failing to cross above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), the price plunged. The cryptocurrency has broken down of the immediate support at $7,702.87, thus triggering our stop loss for the aggressive traders.

The BTC/USD pair has another critical support at $7,337.78, which is 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. If this support also cracks, the pair will become immensely negative and could drop to $5,533.90, which is the 78.60% Fibonacci retracement support.

However, if the bulls defend the support at $7,337.78 and quickly push the price back above $7,702.87, it will indicate demand at lower levels. This move, coupled with the bullish divergence on the RSI might indicate that the current fall is a bear trap to scare the weak hands before reversing direction.

ETH/USD

The failure of the bulls to push Ether (ETH) above the 20-day EMA in the past few days has attracted selling. It has broken down from the immediate support at $161.056. This move triggered our suggested stop loss at $160 which was the point suggested for aggressive traders.

The next support on the downside is $151.829. If this support also cracks, the ETH/USD pair could resume its downtrend towards $122.

However, we have not turned completely bearish yet as the bullish divergence on the RSI is still intact. If the bulls buy this dip and quickly push the price back above the downtrend line, it will indicate that the current fall was a bear trap. Therefore, we will closely watch the price action for signs of a reversal and suggest a trade if we spot one.

XRP/USD

The bulls again failed to keep XRP above $0.29227, which shows that bears are selling aggressively close to $0.30368 levels. The price dipped below both moving averages and fell close to the support at $0.24508 where some buying emerged.

If the XRP/USD pair can climb and sustain above the 50-day SMA, the bulls will again attempt to push it above $0.30368. If successful, the pair can rally to $0.34229. There is a minor resistance at $0.32668 but we expect it to be crossed. For now, the traders can keep a stop loss of $0.24 on their long positions.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is consolidating in a downtrend. The bulls failed to push the price above the $241.85 to $203.36 range in the past two days. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels.

If the bears can sustain the price below the support at $203.36, the downtrend will resume. In such a case, a drop to the next support at $166.98 is possible.

Alternatively, if the bulls buy the dip to $203.36, the BCH/USD pair will extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The first signs of a turnaround will be when the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance of $241.85 and the 50-day SMA. Until then, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines.

LTC/USD

The consolidation in Litecoin (LTC) has resolved to the downside. This is a negative sign as the downtrend has resumed. If the price sustains below $50, the next support on the downside is $40.

If the bulls buy the current dip and push the price above $50 quickly, the LTC/USD pair will extend its range-bound action for a few more days. The first sign of strength will be if the bulls can propel the price above the 50-day SMA. As the pair has been in a long-term downtrend, we will wait for the price to form a reversal pattern before proposing a trade in it.

EOS/USD

EOS has been consolidating in a downtrend. For about a month, the price has been stuck inside a tight range. The failure of the bulls to propel the price above both moving averages shows a lack of urgency among buyers. This shows that traders are not confident that a bottom is in place yet.

If the EOS/USD pair plummets below $2.4001, the downtrend will resume. There is a minor support at $2.18 below which a drop to the yearly low of $1.55 is probable. As the trend is down and the sentiment weak, a long position can quickly turn into a loss-making affair. Therefore, we have withdrawn the buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.

We will wait for a reversal pattern to form before suggesting a trade in it. A breakout of the moving averages will be the first signal that a trend change might be around the corner. For now, we remain neutral on the pair.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) has been in a downtrend for the past few months. The failure of the bulls to push the price above the 50-day SMA has attracted selling that has dragged the price to the first support at $16.50.

If this support cracks, a retest of $14.2555 is likely. A breakdown of this support will resume the downtrend.

Conversely, if the bulls buy the dip to $16.50, we anticipate another attempt to break out of the critical resistance of the 50-day SMA. If the bulls can propel the BNB/USD pair above the 50-day SMA and the channel, it will indicate a probable change in trend. This can offer a low-risk buying opportunity, hence, traders can initiate long positions as suggested by us in an earlier analysis.

BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV (BSV) broke out of the 50-day SMA and the overhead resistance of $107 on Oct. 21. However, the bulls could not sustain the breakout as the price slipped back below $107 on the next day. Currently, the price has plunged below the 50-day SMA, which shows that bears continue to pound the altcoin.

The 20-day EMA is the immediate support. If it holds, the bulls will attempt to push the price back above the $107 to $115.170 resistance zone. A breakout of this zone will indicate that the downtrend has ended. Conversely, if the bears sink the BSV/USD pair below the 20-day EMA and $90.40, a drop to $78.506 is likely.

XLM/USD

The tight range in Stellar (XLM) has resolved to the downside. This is a negative sign as it shows that bears have asserted their supremacy. The next support on the downside is close to $0.056 and below it $0.051014.

If the support levels fail to hold, the downtrend will resume and the next target objective is way lower at $0.028934. Therefore, traders can keep a stop loss of $0.051 on the long positions.

However, if the bulls defend the support levels, we anticipate another attempt to break out of the downtrend line.

TRX/USD

After trading close to the moving averages for the past few days, Tron (TRX) has broken down. It has a minor support at $0.0136940 below which the decline can extend to the next support zone of $0.0116262 to $0.011240. A break below the zone will be a huge negative as the downtrend will resume.

However, if the TRX/USD pair bounces off the immediate support at $0.0136940, the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance of $0.018660.

Considering the negative sentiment, we will withdraw our buy suggestion given in an earlier analysis. We will watch the price action for the next few days and look for signs of a possible turnaround before proposing a trade in it once again.

Market data is provided by HitBTC exchange.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-tanks-to-four-month-low,"Bitcoin’s low volatility consolidation has ended with a violent drop beyond four-month lows near $7,500.

The premier cryptocurrency fell by $500 in just 15 minutes at 12:50 UTC to hit a low of $7,500 – the lowest level since June 10, according to Bitstamp data. It is currently hovering at that price.

The global average price, as represented by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), also hit a low of $7,549. With the price slide, BTC’s market capitalization also tanked to $135 billion.

A big move was overdue as bitcoin’s price volatility had dropped to a 6.5-month low of 2.58 percent earlier today, according to Coinmetrics.

The cryptocurrency was largely trapped in a trading range of $8,500 to $7,850 since the end of September. The consolidation was expected to end with a bullish breakout as technical charts were reporting signs of seller exhaustion near $7,850 – a key Fibonacci retracement level.

The range, however, has ended with a violent move to the downside, possibly due to massive long squeeze reported by @WhaleCalls. A long squeeze occurs when a drop in prices forces long holders to unwind their positions. That adds to the downward pressure, leading to a deeper price slide.

The range breakdown has exposed support at $7,430 (multiple daily lows in June). As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $7,600, representing a 7 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.

Other cryptocurrencies are also flashing red. Names like binance coin and litecoin are reporting 8 percent drop and ether, XRP and bitcoin cash are shedding 6-7 percent, according to CoinMarketCap.

The strict financial regulator in Malaysia is trying to help the local fintech industry scale up and attract new investors. As part of that trend the Malaysia Securities Commission is recognizing the right of cryptocurrency exchanges such as Luno to serve local customers.

Malaysia Approves Digital Asset Exchanges

Luno, the London-headquartered company formerly known as Bitx, has announced on Tuesday that it has been given approval by the Malaysia Securities Commission to operate as a recognized market operator in the Southeast Asian country. Luno is one of only three initial companies that the Malaysian regulator allowed to register when it began the process in June. Luno has now been found by the regulator to have satisfied all the required conditions for approval.

“We’ve been working closely with regulators and banks from day one and we’re now excited to be able to provide customers the ability to buy, sell and trade crypto on our platform,” Luno general manager of Southeast Asia, David Low said. “This is a significant achievement and shows the importance of digital assets today and the long-term value of cryptocurrency.”

The Malaysia Securities Commission was hosting its annual fintech conference on Tuesday, focused on the regulator’s move to broaden the opportunities for a new generation of investors to raise capital or achieve their financial goals. The regulator was happy to note that the Malaysian fintech ecosystem is now home to alternative financing platforms as well as a diverse range of ventures such as digital asset exchanges.

“We are pleased to note that these platforms continue to serve a number of MSME [micro, small and medium enterprises] sectors including high tech, education, retail, F&B and consumer product; and have attracted many new investors especially young investors aged 35 and below,” stated Datuk Syed Zaid Albar, Chairman of the Securities Commission.

Strict Approval Process

When new regulations came into force in June there were nineteen other companies operating in Malaysia during the application process, besides the three that were finally allowed to register, which were all then ordered to cease operations. Before that twenty-one other exchanges were ordered by the regulator to cease operations on March 1. The rate of approved to non-approved exchanges makes the process highly selective and limits the trading venues open to Malaysians.

Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of Luno, commented on Wednesday: “The announcement yesterday of more exchanges being granted Recognized Market Operator (Digital Asset Exchange) status in Malaysia is important as it is a regulator looking to work with and develop digital assets for the benefit of businesses and communities. As regulatory oversight increases around the world this will help stabilise and develop the sector.”

Luno claims to have around 3 million users worldwide, spread across 40 countries. The company also has local offices in South Africa, Indonesia, Nigeria, Singapore and Malaysia, with a workforce of over 300 employees around the world. It recently added bitcoin cash trading to the platform following feedback from its client base, making BCH only the third cryptocurrency available for trading on the exchange.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bitcoin’s price dropped on Wednesday to its lowest level against the dollar since the middle of May after Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerbeg, in testimony before Congress, expressed doubts about whether the company’s cryptocurrency project Libra was going to work.

Bitcoin's price on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange was last down 6.95% at $7,471 BTC=BTSP, after hitting a five-month low below $7,300.

Appearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, Zuckerberg admitted that he did not know if Libra would work. But he sought to reassure lawmakers that Facebook would not back any move by the crypto project, which comprises a consortium of 21 members including venture capital firms and nonprofits, to launch the digital currency until it had satisfied all U.S. regulatory concerns.

“Bitcoin quickly broke once Zuckerberg’s testimony got started,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York. “Right now there’s a growing sentiment that we may never see Libra live and that’s just a potential setback for the entire crypto space.”

Libra is intended to be a digital currency backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and held by a network of custodians. The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilize the price.

The plans have attracted intense scrutiny from regulators concerned about its impact on the financial system, user privacy and its potential for use in money laundering.

Aside from concerns about Libra, Charles Hayter, chief executive officer of CryptoCompare also pointed out that after an early upswing in the year that galvanized prices in the crypto sector, “we have seen weakening volumes and regulatory tightening from a number of jurisdictions.”

A bank in Belarus has effectively gotten the green light to process transfers related to digital assets. DFS, an affiliated company of Belveb Banking Holding’s member VEB Technologies, was recently registered as a resident of the High Technologies Park. The country’s special economic zone has already become home to many crypto businesses.

Crypto Investment Platform to Pay Dividends to Bank Accounts

DFS LLC is the operator of Finstore.by, a platform for token sales and trading. Belveb Bank will provide its clients with regular banking services, the Belarusian news outlet Dev.by reported. Corporate entities and private individuals will be able to purchase tokens from various coin offering projects that Finstore hosts.

The first such sale begins on Nov. 1, 2019 and will be conducted on behalf of Belwest, a shoe manufacturer and supplier founded by the German concern Salamander. Finstore will offer 63,000 of its digital tokens and sell them for euros, Russian and Belarussian rubles. The platform plans to issue its own token next month which will be used to facilitate future deals.

Investors buying the coins from this and other offerings will enjoy a fixed income from their investments, much like with bank deposits, at least before interest rates in Europe entered subzero territory. They will also be able to withdraw their dividends to a regular checking account or a bank card account.

Belarus legalized crypto-related activities with a presidential decree signed by Alexander Lukashenko in late 2017. Decree №8 “On the Development of the Digital Economy” came into force on March 28, 2018 to regulate crypto exchange services, initial coin offerings, mining operations, and smart contracts. A five-year tax holiday and other incentives were introduced for HTP-registered crypto entities.

The decree provides legal definitions to key terms used in the crypto space. For example, ‘cryptocurrency’ has been described as “bitcoin, other digital sign (token) used in international circulation as a universal means of exchange.” To improve the decree’s implementation, Minsk adopted new accounting standards for the industry and later expanded the applicable regulatory framework.

HTP Registers 129 New Businesses Including Crypto Companies

Finstore is designed for buying and selling digital tokens representing securities – not exactly cryptocurrencies. But it is not the only digital asset trading platform operating out of Belarus. At least two other full-fledged crypto exchanges provide services to traders and investors under the preferential terms of their registration with the Belarus High-Tech Park.

Currency.com, for instance, facilitates the purchases and sales of decentralized cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin core (BTC) with a choice of fiat currencies, including the euro, the U.S. dollar, the Russian and the Belarusian ruble. Another Belarus-regulated platform supporting trading pairs with BCH is Iexchange.

The number of crypto and blockchain businesses applying for HTP residency is constantly growing. According to the park’s website, 684 entities are currently registered in the special economic zone. Earlier this month, its supervisory board accepted another 129 new members, including crypto companies like Belveb’s affiliate DFS.

Bitcoin nosedived Wednesday as Congress members highlighted the downsides of cryptocurrency on Capitol Hill.

The world's largest digital currency fell as much as 9% to a low of $7,435.26 Wednesday. That marked bitcoin's lowest level since June.

The plunge came as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to defend plans for a new cryptocurrency, libra. Zuckerberg's testimony follows a July congressional hearing with David Marcus, the former PayPal executive in charge of Facebook's libra project, in which lawmakers blasted the project and potential for cryptocurrencies to be used for money laundering and terrorism.

""Today's selloff is a continuation of the themes that have been plaguing crypto for the past few months — increased regulatory scrutiny,"" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca.

While some analysts say Facebook's involvement put crypto on the map, it has also brought new scrutiny to the fledgling technology. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., was among those from both political parties Wednesday who highlighted libra's potential use by drug dealers, tax evaders and terrorists.

""Cryptocurrency either doesn't work, in which case investors lose a lot of money, or it does achieve its objectives, and displaces the U.S. dollar as the sole reserve currency in the world,"" Sherman said during the hearing.

SAN FRANCISCO — When the value of the XRP cryptocurrency skyrocketed, so did the assets of Rippleworks, a nonprofit foundation with an endowment based on cryptocurrency.

Rippleworks launched four years ago with a mission to help social ventures to scale, primarily by pairing business and technology experts with social enterprises based in emerging markets. A personal donation from Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple — a company that leverages blockchain technology to send money around the world — kicked off the effort.

“We may be a funder, but we’re an entrepreneur-first funder.” — Doug Galen, co-founder and CEO, Rippleworks

The value of XRP grew from next to nothing in 2015 to the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin — growing by over 30,000 % in 2017. The jump prompted the foundation’s co-founders to think bigger.

Rippleworks funds its operations by converting a tiny fraction of its XRP into dollars. And with new resources at its disposal, the foundation saw an opportunity to build on its work in human capital by expanding into financial capital. Doug Galen, co-founder and CEO of Rippleworks, expanded on the thinking behind this shift in a meeting with Devex at its offices in Redwood City, California.

With assets now valued at $370 million, the organization has stayed true to its focus on supporting entrepreneurs as it transitions from operator to funder, Galen told Devex

A crypto-powered foundation

Galen and Larsen, who built the online lender E-Loan together, are both interested in broadening the perspectives of Silicon Valley executives who might otherwise be detached from ways to make an impact on the rest of the world.

Nonprofits explore the newest fundraising frontier: Cryptocurrency UNICEF can now receive, hold, and disburse digital currency built on blockchain technology — and nonprofits are taking note. Those considering cryptocurrency fundraising can learn from early adopters on which currencies to accept and whether to hold or convert donations.

After Galen talked with a range of experts from the world of social entrepreneurship, philanthropy, and impact investing, he arrived at a model that pairs executives from leading tech companies with social enterprises based in emerging markets. For example, the chief security officer at Slack, a company that builds collaboration software tools, worked with M-Kopa, a Kenyan solar energy company, to strengthen its data security. Then, as the value of XRP went up, Galen and Larsen discussed how the foundation could provide new forms of support, including funding.

“We had some idea that those resources could turn into more resources,” Larsen said, who is now a billionaire thanks to the value of XRP, which like other cryptocurrencies has seen a lot of volatility over the years.

The only problem was, the foundation was not yet set up as a funder. Rippleworks could have met the 5% minimum distribution required of private foundations in the United States by putting its money into a donor-advised fund, vehicles for philanthropy, which does not have to distribute those funds to nonprofits. But instead, the foundation worked to develop its approach to funding in consultation with other entrepreneurs.

A pro-entrepreneur investment approach

Galen and his team organized dinners with CEOs and fundraisers to ask: Who are the best and worst funders? What makes them that way? And what might it look like to build a foundation from the ground up with a focus on supporting entrepreneurs?

The foundation drew on that feedback to design its pipeline, diligence, and funding process.

Now, Rippleworks supports entrepreneurs with debt, equity, and grants. One of its early investments supported Kiva Protocol, a digital identification system that is using blockchain to provide access to financial services in Sierra Leone, with a $5 million convertible grant that will convert to equity if Kiva decides to go with a for-profit structure. Because the foundation trades into dollars, it funds in dollars, not XRP.

The foundation has been co-investing with other funders in debt and equity deals in order to use its capital as a “bridge to somewhere” or as a way to “crowd in other funders,” Galen said.

“Where can we be catalytic? Where do we see the gaps? And what is the right role for foundation dollars?” said Ayesha Wagle, head of investments at Rippleworks.

Wagle, former president at Komaza, an organization that partners with smallholder farmers in Africa to plant tree farms, came into the organization sensitive to the power dynamics between those who have money and those who are asking for money, she told Devex.

At Rippleworks, Wagle suddenly had capital that was flexible, geography and sector agnostic, and entrepreneur-friendly — news that traveled quickly among social entrepreneurs.

“I had heard that Rippleworks had to get money out really fast, so I reached out really fast,” said Anushka Ratnayake, CEO of MyAgro, a social enterprise that developed a mobile layaway system for smallholder farmers.

The changing face of KfW As Germany grows into its role as an aid leader, its development finance institutions are evolving.

Ratnayake had just gotten its first large government grant from KfW, the German development bank, “But the deal almost fell apart when they saw our balance sheet,” she said.

Without a reserve, government donors would not be comfortable funding MyAgro, Ratnayake said, because they feared the social enterprise would not be able to withstand an unexpected event, such as a grant coming in late.

Rippleworks awarded MyAgro with a grant of $3 million and a loan of $1.5 million.

Ratnayake said she appreciates how Rippleworks began by asking her what she needed, used materials she had created before for other donors, then worked quickly to get this money out the door on a timeframe that worked for MyAgro.

“We said: ‘Dream big. Forget what other funders say. What do you actually need instead of tailoring your ask to somebody?’” Wagle said, reflecting on her conversation with Ratnayake. “I felt like I got to be the funder I wanted to talk to when I was raising money.”

From one-to-one to one-to-many

After several years refining its model pairing experts with projects in emerging markets, Rippleworks wanted to do more to address what it sees as a human capital crisis facing social enterprises.

With the rise of the price of XRP, and the growth of the Rippleworks endowment, the foundation now holds in-person convenings to serve more people, Galen explained. These workshops draw on and teach from the same frameworks that Rippleworks experts have used in projects with social enterprises over the years.

“Our philosophy is: identify a critical problem, get in, solve it, have an endpoint, transfer knowledge, keep in touch,” Galen said.

For example, the foundation recently hosted a convening in Sao Paolo, Brazil with Flourish, an initiative that spun out of the Omidyar Network with a focus on investing in financial inclusion.

Within 10 weeks of each convening, Rippleworks reaches back out to participants, and their goal is to have more than 60% of them rank the experience a 5 out of 5 with plans underway or in the works to implement what they learned.

While the Rippleworks model has expanded far more quickly than most foundations experience, Galen wants to make sure the organization stays true to its initial mission.

“I want to make sure we never lose our pro entrepreneur DNA,” Galen said. “We are former entrepreneurs. We are about entrepreneurs. And we may be a funder, but we’re an entrepreneur-first funder.”",2019-10-23 12:12:36+00:00

The Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund will allow weekly withdrawals and require minimums higher than $25,000.

The world of cryptocurrency can be confusing at the best of times, but if you throw in the terms “whale,” “bear,” and “bull,” you’re probably left wondering what these animals have to do with digital currencies such as Bitcoin.

Luckily for you, Hard Fork has produced a quick overview to define each term and explain why they’re important for the cryptocurrency space.

The whales

By definition, a cryptocurrency whale is a term used to refer to individuals, or entities, that hold large amounts of digital currencies. Both feared and marvelled upon in equal measure, much like the marine mammals with whom they share a namesake, Bitcoin whales move around the cryptocurrency space causing waves at every turn.

Many Bitcoin whales are anonymous traders, exchanges, and hedge funds, identifiable only by their public addresses. Well-known whales include Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin‘s mysterious creator(s) who is thought to have at least one million Bitcoin. The Winklevoss twins, Tyler and Cameron, were at one given time estimated to own 1 percent of all Bitcoins in existence.

But, why is this an issue? Well, if you bear in mind that Bitcoin‘s blockchain is decentralized, you can start to understand why several individuals holding large amounts of coins could be problematic for the market.

With their digital wealth, and the fact that the cryptocurrency market remains largely unregulated, whales could have sufficient influence to move the market in their preferred direction. It’s therefore not uncommon for traders to pay close attention to whales, observing how, when, and where they trade.

The bears

When we talk about a cryptocurrency bear market, we are referring to a market situation defined by caution and pessimism during which traders are much more likely to sell than buy.

During a bear market, you can expect to gain lower highs and lower lows. A good example of this is Bitcoin‘s downturn at the start of 2018.

It’s important not to confuse a bear market with a price correction.

A bear market is a sustained period of time characterized by noticeable downward movements. A price correction takes place when the price of an overvalued currency, or commodity, corrects itself.

The bulls

A cryptocurrency bull market is the opposite of a bear market.

So, if the market trend is up, then we’re witnessing a bull market. In this sense, bull markets are generally characterized by optimism, and investor confidence.

For example, Bitcoin reaching $20,000 apiece in December 2017 is a clear example of a cryptocurrency bull market.

So, there you go: bears, bulls, and whales go hand in hand in the cryptocurrency arena and you should hopefully now have a better understanding of what they are and how they operate.",2019-10-24,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/24/watford-lead-way-crypto-express-new-technology,"Can digital currency bring supporters from all over the world together and give them a role in the club, or is it just a gimmick?

Last month, Watford took an unusual decision. Not the one to sack Javi Gracia four matches into the season; that was kind of standard. Rather it had something to do with the sleeves on the kit that, the club said, would be sporting the logo of Bitcoin. Hoping to “educate the public on the benefits of using cryptocurrencies”, the sponsorship would form part of a “wider campaign to improve awareness”.

Another measure allowed supporters to pay with Bitcoin at the club’s online store. In doing so, Watford became one of the first football clubs in the world to accept digital currency. Suspicion remains they will not be turning over vast amounts of the stuff, however, when even Bitcoin’s cheerleaders – including the gambling company sportsbet.io, which is Watford’s main shirt sponsor and paid for the sleeve endorsement – accept a campaign is necessary to explain what Bitcoin is.

Cryptocurrency (crypto for short) cannot be readily reduced into a simple concept, but here’s an attempt: it describes a digital form of money created independently of any central bank that is encrypted and so is anonymous and verifiable. If that still seems impenetrable then be assured you are not alone. But for now it’s enough to recognise that a lot of people see crypto – and the blockchain, the technology that underpins it – as the future, even if they’re not quite sure how. These people are generally interested in making money off the back of it. That football should want to be involved is predictable and also revealing.

Watford are not alone in joining the crypto express. Bayern Munich have launched a series of blockchain “collectibles” that is a kind of crypto Top Trumps. Manchester City have done the same, except theirs is a crypto Tamagotchi (the game is called FC Superstars and is made in conjunction with a South Korean company called Superbloke).

Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid, Roma, Galatasaray and West Ham have signed deals with Socios.com. The plan here is for fans to acquire club tokens, some for free, others bought using Socios’s own cryptocurrency, Chiliz (one of 3,000 cryptocurrencies being traded online). These tokens would confirm you as a supporter though what you do with them next is not clear.

He’s a crypto enthusiast, former poker entrepreneur and the man behind Socios.com. “99.9% of fans, especially fans of big teams, are not in the stadium,” he says. “Because of globalisation and digitalisation there are now hundreds of millions of fans elsewhere in the world. We feel there’s a gap of engagement with these supporters.

“There is currently no solution for clubs to say: ‘This is a fan and I connect with them.’ Tokens are a way of knowing these fans. There is also an activation play too. Clubs don’t have many things to sell to fans in Asia. They can buy shirts, but most of them are fake. [Fan tokens] are a way to engage and monetise globally.”

Dreyfus envisages a future where token holders have a say in the running of their club (perhaps helping to choose the next kit design, say). He says that this is a commitment shared by Socios.com’s partners . One of those partners, however, said they would not be countenancing such measures for fear of creating two tiers of support: those that had the tokens and those that didn’t.

As for the selling of stuff, that seems mainly to involve fan tokens themselves. Dreyfus’s Twitter feed features a mock-up of a talk show with people chatting about clubs and their tokens as an index of their value flashes alongside. It’s a cross between Soccer Saturday and a business channel and as baffling as that sounds.

Socios.com does not exist yet, either. The first sponsorship deals, with Juve and PSG, were announced a year ago but the company’s website still offers the chance only to “stay in the loop” about the product’s launch. Plans for a Pokemon Go-style token hunt this summer never materialised. Dreyfus said he expected a soft launch this month and on Twitter has suggested lift-off in “the next few weeks”.

There are now hundreds of millions of fans elsewhere in the world

Crypto went mainstream a couple of years ago thanks to an explosion in the value of Bitcoin. Despite falling back since (a single Bitcoin is still worth more than £6,500) the enthusiasm remains and while practical uses appear limited there are ways crypto and sport, particularly football, intertwine seductively.

First, shopping in crypto allows fans in Hong Kong to behave like fans in Harlow, Essex. Second, it allows them to gamble like them too (as Watford’s sponsors are no doubt well aware). Third, it is at least an attempt to create something like a stake in a club for fans who only ever follow the team on the screen. These fans, it should not need pointing out, outnumber the physical variety by orders of magnitude.

“We can compare it to the early days of the internet,” says Iqbal Gandham, managing director of digital investment company, eToro. “Currently they’re dabbling to see what the benefits are. One of those, I would say, is the ability to go global very quickly. But at this stage it’s probably not [built on] a business case, but more about getting involved in order to get a better understanding.”

Gandham believes the current offering remains unclear. “The companies that release these tokens have to have a long hard think and ask: ‘Are we really giving something back to the fans?’” he says. “Do they get ownership in the club? Do they get voting rights, and if so what do they entail? If it’s a real change it could become a useful thing for an individual to have. If it just gives you a discount on a shirt, I’m not sure fans will react in the way that the clubs and companies want them to.”

Scepticism about crypto is healthy and there have been a number of scams associated with digital currency, with the Financial Conduct Authority estimating Britons have lost £27m this year. Questions of utility remain, too, but people such as Dreyfus are plugged into a digital world still not well understood by professional sports clubs or their governing bodies.

“We are just one tool that clubs can have to compete with other entertainment products,” Dreyfus says. “Recently we had the CEO of Liverpool [Peter Moore] saying Fortnite is a competitor to a Liverpool match. Youngsters want more [from their entertainment] – they are used to being connected.”

Where, in his mind, might the crypto-fication of football end up? “My dream is that one day we would launch a Socios Cup, and the starting XIs would be decided entirely by fans,” Dreyfus says.

The U.S. remains a challenging environment for centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, with major players significantly scaling back their operations and others heading for the door. The most recent casualty of America’s stringent regulatory climate is one time market-leader Poloniex, which has “spun out” from parent company Circle, spinning out of the U.S. market in the process and leaving a void for other exchanges to fill.

Poloniex Heads for the Door, Other Exchanges Enter

Until fairly recently, American citizens could freely trade hundreds of digital assets across exchanges such as Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex, and Binance. Those options have been rapidly whittled down, however, as centralized exchanges have been forced to either exclude the U.S. altogether or render the majority of their assets off-limits to traders east of the Atlantic.

Following a buyout from an Asian investment group, Poloniex will continue to operate internationally, but U.S. customers will be forced to cease trading from as early as November 1. Binance and Bittrex have also been given pause to reconsider their American strategies, vastly reducing the number of trading pairs available to customers in the USA. As centralized exchanges continue to struggle with regulation and red tape, the market seems primed for alternative solutions such as decentralized exchanges and token swapping protocols that aren’t so easily cowed by regulators. It’s a lucrative space which new players are actively seeking to exploit.

The Decline of Centralized Exchanges

American traders find themselves particularly ill-served by centralized exchanges. Not only do they have fewer platforms to trade on, but the available options are severely crippled and a poor reflection of the true state of the crypto market in 2019. Poloniex has officially hit the iceberg and is abandoning ship, Bittrex is severely wounded and a shadow of itself. Coinbase, Kraken and the relaunched Binance US are all options, but each has limitations due to a need to appease regulators, resulting in a sub-optimal experience. Coinbase is more truthfully a brokerage in any case, Kraken is struggling to innovate in the strict regulatory climate it finds itself in, and Binance US is possibly the least satisfying iteration of the exchanges, providing only a fraction of the trading pairs enjoyed by customers elsewhere.

U.S. traders are effectively operating with one hand tied behind their back while being force-fed the decaf soy milk latte of crypto. For those who want to enjoy full mobility and to drink in the “full fat” experience, two practical options remain: VPN or DEX. In the case of the Binance DEX, U.S. customers would need to use both, firing up a VPN to connect to the DEX, which defeats at least one of the reasons for choosing a decentralized exchange in the first place. Moreover, should an exchange find that U.S. customers are illegally accessing it, it could potentially freeze funds, which presents another headache.

From a legal perspective, a DEX is bound by the same rules and regulations as any centralized exchange, but if it is decentralized enough to have no formal company structure, U.S. regulators are largely powerless to act. Quite simply, if a DEX can be accessed from the U.S. then it can be traded upon. Of the existing options, Uniswap and Bancor are the leading Ethereum-based candidates, in terms of UX certainly, but also with regards to liquidity. Bancor has cracked the liquidity problem through the use of liquidity pools that enable conversion between tokens through the use of multiple smart contracts. Cotrader has built a DEX on the Bancor protocol that promises a “free, open source, unrestricted portal into the Bancor network,” enabling anyone, anywhere to trustlessly trade ERC20s.

Can’t Poloniex the DEX

Decentralized exchanges have been a long-held dream of the crypto community, but until recently, the drawbacks of using one mostly outweighed the benefits. Now the tide is finally turning as decentralized trading matures and key players become more adept at meeting customer expectations. The user experience has been greatly improved, order matching is faster, and slippage has been minimized through plugging into multiple liquidity pools.

Further, the very nature of decentralized exchanges means they cannot be easily censored and stopped. Without a central point of attack, DEXs avoid the vulnerabilities inherent to centralized exchanges, including being at the mercy of U.S. regulators. Now ever greater numbers of Ethereum DEXs are emerging including Nash, which bridges Ethereum and NEO, Loopring’s Dolomite DEX, and Dex.blue. There are also P2P platforms such as local.Bitcoin.com which enable users to swap BCH without the need to deposit funds.

Another decentralized exchange which has opened to the sort of fanfare you would expect from a John McAfee project is McAfeeDex. As one of crypto’s most prominent and colorful characters, McAfee is certainly more than capable of getting the word out on his latest venture, but whether his eponymous DEX will fill the vacuum left by centralized exchanges remains to be seen.

It would be naive to think that decentralized exchanges can replace their centralized counterparts at this point in time; the fact that most DEXs are native to one blockchain only means the tech isn’t even capable of supporting seamless trading of multi-chain assets; wrapped workarounds such as WBTC are the closest substitute, currently. For U.S. traders craving the full trading experience, a combination of top 20 assets on centralized platforms and the long tail of ERC20s on decentralized protocols is about as good as they’re gonna get.

Which centralized and decentralized exchanges do you think will gain market share in the US? Let us know in the comments section below.

Sherman: Crypto could “achieve its objectives”

During the latest hearing over Facebook’s Libra digital currency on Oct. 23, Brad Sherman used his chance to speak to deliver fresh criticism of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and their alleged use cases.

Sherman, who was already well known as an opponent of any money that challenges the U.S. dollar’s role as a global reserve currency, built on his previous claims from May when quizzing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

“I’m not here to be anti-Facebook; I was anti-cryptocurrency back when you were anti-cryptocurrency,” he told Zuckerberg.

Continuing, Sherman nonetheless appeared to give unlikely weight to the idea that a disruptive financial instrument can succeed in taking power away from the dollar.

“Cryptocurrency either doesn’t work, in which case investors lose a lot of money, or it does achieve its objectives perhaps and displaces the U.S. dollar or interferes with the U.S. dollar being virtually the sole reserve currency in the world,” he said.

Tired dollar arguments

As Cointelegraph reported, Sherman has made it known he is no more a fan of Libra, which he called the “Zuck Buck” in July than Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.

His comments coincided with a dramatic slide on Bitcoin markets, however, with BTC/USD plunging 8% to hit levels not seen since before Facebook published Libra’s whitepaper in June 2019.

Sherman added that he thought the dollar was a poor choice for criminals, contradicting various findings that showed fiat remains preferable for money laundering and financing of terrorism over publicly-traceable Bitcoin.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-to-launch-options-on-its-bitcoin-futures-dec-9,"The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is launching bitcoin options contracts through its subsidiary Bakkt.

Bakkt announced Thursday that it would “launch the first regulated options contract for bitcoin futures,” adding a new product to its current slate of physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts. CEO Kelly Loeffler said in a Medium post that the contracts were built in response to customer feedback, and that ICE Futures US self-certified the contract through the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

“We’re committed to bringing trust and utility to digital assets and the options contract is an example of the many products we’re developing for regulated markets,” she wrote. “The Bakkt Bitcoin Options contract will be based on the benchmark Bakkt Monthly Bitcoin Futures contract and represents another important step in developing this asset class for institutional investors, their customers and investors.”

Notably, customers will have the choice of options contracts settled with cash, meaning customers receive the fiat equivalent to the contract’s value at expiration, or physically, meaning they receive the actual bitcoin.

When Bakkt launched its bitcoin futures contract a month ago, the company saw low trading volume. However, it appears to have picked up in recent days.

Loeffler added:

“We’ve been working closely with market participants to build liquidity, create market transparency and build open interest. Notably, we saw a record 590 contracts of Bakkt Bitcoin Monthly Futures change hands yesterday, October 23. We also completed a milestone with seamless physical deliveries in both our daily and monthly bitcoin futures contracts.”

Bakkt is joining CME in launching options. The Chicago-based exchange announced it would launch bitcoin options on top of its futures contracts in the first quarter of 2020.

In addition to its options contracts, Bakkt is launching a market maker program to boost trading of its monthly contract, according to a letter addressed to the CFTC.

“The Exchange believes the new Program will incentivize additional liquidity and volume in the new Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Monthly Futures Contract,” the letter states.

This week, as he endured a bitter hearing before the US House Financial Services Committee, it felt as though Zuckerberg’s cryptocurrency project Libra was on trial. As they did in July, lawmakers railed against Libra, worrying it could facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing. They questioned Facebook’s CEO about his company’s unchecked expansion and expressed fears that Libra could threaten the US dollar.

But while Zuckerberg endured another public humiliation, he demonstrated exactly what not to do for companies contemplating a crypto strategy. Creating private money (like Libra) is not the answer. The CEO of another social network realizes that.

Although he’s also pursuing a crypto future, Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Twitter and Square, hasn’t absorbed a beating. He’s actually been celebrated by the open-source software community. That’s because, unlike Facebook, he’s not reinventing the wheel and trying to profit off it.

Rather than propose a new digital currency as the savior of the financial system, Square has embraced what already exists: bitcoin. Over the last year, the company has hired a team to contribute to the original cryptocurrency through Square Crypto. And while they’re technically employed by Square, these engineers are working on bitcoin virtually as a public service. Square Crypto is focusing on perhaps less thrilling but critical issues like code reviews, ensuring that GitHub contributions are free from performance and security bugs. They’re thinking about how to make the open financial system—the heart of bitcoin—work for everyone, not just a club of corporate elites. Dorsey believes that money ought to be free-flowing, much like the internet itself, he said in a June interview with TheNextWeb:

An internet company can launch something and it’s available around the world. Whereas with payments, you have to go to each market and pay attention to regulators. You need a partnership with a local bank. This is a very slow process in any new market. The Internet having a native currency will enable us (Square) to be more like an Internet company.

It’s not surprising that Facebook doesn’t get this. Everything you do on the social media website—every click, every like, every poke—is supposed to enrich the company’s shareholders. Today, Mark Zuckerberg is the fifth-richest person in the world. (And I’m guessing, he’d probably like to stay there, if not move up.)

Given that he is also a billionaire, it’s perhaps surprising that Dorsey is different, that he has the open-mindedness to bet on bitcoin, which realistically, he has no control over. He seems to envision a future where Square and bitcoin can coexist, even thrive together.

“The creation of [bitcoin] was very pure, and focused on a public good, rather than any other particular agenda,” Dorsey told Quartz in June. “The fact that it’s meant to be deflationary, meant to incentivize savings instead of spending, I think is a net positive for the world and how we think about consuming. Because it is a scarce resource, it has a probability of always increasing in value, which makes you consider a lot more how you spend it.”

So how does Jack view Libra? He offered his perspective yesterday (Oct. 24) at the Twitter News Summit:

Indeed, if Mark Zuckerberg—or the members of the Libra Association (past or present)—actually want to make a difference, they’d probably be better off following Square’s lead. Dorsey can point them in the right direction.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-jumps-12-as-chinas-xi-embraces-blockchain-boosting-crypto-sentiment,"View

Bitcoin prices are rebounding from a five-month low touched earlier this week.

Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country should seize opportunities afforded by blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin.

Despite China’s ban on cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017, the comments from the leader of the world’s second-largest economy could boost sentiment toward digital assets in general, providing a positive market backdrop for bitcoin, says eToro’s Mati Greenspan.

Bitcoin prices shot up 12 percent Friday, climbing off a five-month low touched earlier this week, after Chinese President Xi Jinping said his countrymen should “seize the opportunity” afforded by blockchain technology.

Although China’s central bank ordered mainland-based coin exchanges to close in 2017, Xi’s comments in support of enterprise blockchain, which share the distributed-ledger technology underpinning bitcoin, is good for sentiment around the crypto industry, said Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at exchange eToro.

And that in turn could be boosting sentiment toward bitcoin, the original blockchain-based digital asset invented a decade ago, Greenspan said.

“It’s bullish for the entire crypto industry, in general, when you have the leader of one of the world’s largest economies coming to embrace blockchain technology like this,” Greenspan said in a phone interview from Tel Aviv. “Bitcoin, as we know, is a central player in the blockchain industry.”

Bitcoin jumped 12 percent in the past 24 hours, reaching $8,392 as of 16:02 UTC (12:02 p.m. New York time). Earlier this week, the cryptocurrency touched $7,363, the lowest since May 18.

Friday’s price jump-started right around 10:15 UTC, right after Xi’s favorable blockchain comments were published in Chinese media.

The Chinese president’s statements on blockchain are believed to be his first in-depth remarks on the technology. Chinese officials are developing a digital version of the country’s own currency, but have forbidden other coins from being traded.

President Xi said on Thursday:

“We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.”

eToro’s Greenspan said that the price jump appeared to be directly correlated with the Chinese leader’s comments.

“It seems like this is what investors were reacting to,” Greenspan said. “There’s only so much amount of good news that can be ignored. Xi is one of the most important people in the world.”

Bitcoin remains well off its 2019 high of $12,920 reached in June, though prices are still more than double where they started the year.

The Chinese leader said they have no choice but to embrace blockchain tech due to its importance “in the new round of technological innovation and industrial transformation.”

President Xi also noted that China should focus on accelerating the adoption of blockchain architecture to ensure its use in financial transactions, saying that the promising technology could set the stage for resolving the real economy’s issues.

China favors blockchain over cryptocurrency

Crypto proponents are taking encouragement from a string of recent headlines showing greater interest in the space from China. Apart from Xi’s speech, the news comes amid China’s desire to launch the world’s first government-backed cryptocurrency. Several Chinese officials have publicly spoken out over the past several weeks about the need for China to launch its own digital currency, and the country’s central bank appears to be making rapid progress in the process.

China previously declared war against cryptocurrencies, prohibiting initial coin offerings and clamping down on its promoters. But China’s raid on the virtual asset class, which started in ‎‎September 2017, failed to dampen local investors’ ‎enthusiasm, as many have resorted to other channels to get ‎around the crackdown. ‎

Despite such reservations, the government supported the underlying blockchain technology to revolutionize economic sectors and even included the technology in its roadmap for the nation’s development by 2020.

Besides start-up companies, the affiliates of technology giants such as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent appeared in the list of firms exploring blockchain’s potential uses.

During a meeting with the Politburo Committee yesterday, President Xi highlighted the potential for blockchain to bolster the Chinese economy, while remarking on plans to spearhead the development of blockchain technologies.

After starting off today relatively flat, since news of the announcement broke, Bitcoin has seen a sudden surge upwards. Its price has climbed from just over $7,500 up to its current value of $7,652—a gain of around 2%—and appears to be still rising.

The news has also sent the rest of the market into a minor recovery. As it stands, practically every major cryptocurrency is seeing gains of between 1 to 5% in the last day, while Bitcoin SV has shot up by over 15%.

The move comes just two days after Bitcoin experienced a dramatic sell-off, falling from over $8,000 to just $7,500 over a period of three hours. Despite this recent mini-rally, Bitcoin is still performing poorly as of late, having lost 4% this week and more than 20% in the last month.

On the site, which has a 2.4 million user base, Tether currently accounts for 30% of volume, which is 30 times more than a year ago.

Tether undermines Ether’s leadership?

Bitcoin application as a means of payment has seen a nearly 60% drop in volume from 80% last year, according to CoinPayments, while Tether has pushed Ether out of second place. Users purportedly choose Tether due to the stablecoin’s capability to avoid price fluctuations. Sean Mackay, operations lead at CoinPayments.net, said:

“Merchants used to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and convert it into Tether in order to hedge against the volatility. Now we are seeing the payments just being done directly in Tether.”

Bitcoin has charted a so-called death cross with recent the drop to $7,400. The bearish cross comes as a result of the 47 percent slide from the 2019 high of $13,800, and as such is a lagging indicator.

Historical data shows BTC tends to bottom out after a death cross.

The cryptocurrency has picked up a bid at press time, but is yet to invalidate the bearish case with a move above the Sept. 30 low of$7,714.

A long-term bitcoin price indicator has turned bearish, courtesy of the cryptocurrency’s sharp drop in the last four months.

The 50-day moving price average (MA) crossed below the 200-day MA today, confirming a “death cross” for the first time since March 31, 2018, according to Bitstamp data.

The long-term bearish cross was preceded by a sharp drop from the 2019 high of $13,880 (June 26) to the low of $7,293 (Oct. 23).

To put it another way, the death cross is the product of the 47 percent slide from the high of $13,880. After all, the 50-day MA responds to the data that is at least 2.5-months old and the 200-day MA is sensitive to 6.5-month old data.

Daily chart

BTC topped out at $13,880 on June 26 and fell back to $9,000 in mid-July. The 50-day MA, however, continued to rise and topped out in mid-August, 6 weeks after BTC topped out above $13,800.

Meanwhile, the 200-day MA maintained an upward trajectory throughout the sell-off from $13,880 to recent lows below $7,300.

Currently, the 200-day MA is sidelined near $8,895 and the 50-day MA is trending south and is now around $8,890.

All-in-all, it seems safe to conclude that the death cross is a lagging indicator and happens when most of the correction has already taken place, as tweeted by popular trader @CryptoTutor following the confirmation of the bearish cross on March 31, 2018.

As seen above, the April 2014 death cross marked a major bottom in BTC from where the cryptocurrency rallied 100 percent.

It’s worth noting the bearish crossovers seen in September 2015 and April 2018 trapped sellers on the wrong side of the market, as discussed last Friday.

The latest bear cross poses the same threat, as prices have already dropped more than 45 percent. In fact, BTC is showing signs of life on confirmation of the death cross.

At press time, BTC is changing hands at $7,600 on Bitstamp, having picked up a bid near $7,393 earlier today. That said, it is still too early to call a bullish reversal.

Daily chart

The range breakdown confirmed on Wednesday is intact. Further, 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. The relative strength index’s (RSI) downside break of the ascending trendline is also a bearish development.

BTC, therefore, remains on the hunt for a drop to key support levels at $7,200 (three-day chart 100-candle MA) and $7,000 (three-day chart 200-candle MA).

The bearish setup on the daily chart will remain valid as long as prices are holding below the former support-turned-resistance of $7,714.

The outlook would turn bullish if and when prices rise above $8,314 (Oct. 21 high). That would also validate the argument that the death cross is a contrary indicator.

Ministerstwo Finansów unveiled this month the new PIT-38 (personal income tax) form which will simplify the reporting and settlement of taxes related to cryptocurrencies. The form will be used by private individuals residing in Poland. The country’s finance ministry claims it will make crypto taxation easier and more transparent.

The updated form allows Polish taxpayers to enter proceeds from the sale of virtual currencies and provide data about the costs of acquiring digital coins and tokens. Investment costs from consecutive years can be added until they are fully deducted. However, no deduction should be claimed from other sources of income such as the sale of shares.

To properly report their profit from cryptocurrency trading, Poles need to obtain and provide financial statements from the digital asset exchanges they have used to purchase and sell the coins, Polish news outlet Kryptowaluty detailed.

Efforts to Regulate Crypto Taxation in Poland

The executive power in Warsaw has been taking steps to regulate the taxation of proceeds received from cryptocurrency trading since last year. The framework that has been developed and implemented since the beginning of 2019 covers personal as well as corporate income tax.

In the first case, profits from digital asset trading should be taxed as income from cash capital. If the trading is private, the revenue is classified as income from property rights and taxed according to the regular progressive scale with rates between 18% and 32%. If the profit comes from a business activity, the income may be subject to a 19% flat rate.

Revenues from trading conducted by corporate entities are regarded as capital gains. The base rate paid by larger companies is again 19%. Smaller corporate taxpayers enjoy a preferential rate which was 15% in 2018.

Since January 2019, however, entities reporting revenues of up to €1.2 million within a tax year and startups established this year will pay only 9% income tax if they meet certain conditions. The “small taxpayer” threshold will be increased to €2 million in January 2020.

The new tax regime for crypto trading does not concern entities registered and operating as providers of cryptocurrency exchange services. That includes crypto-to-crypto trading platforms as well as those exchanging decentralized digital money such as bitcoin cash (BCH) with traditional fiat currency like the Polish zloty.

Per the report, the new regulatory framework aims to set standards for the application of cryptography and the management of passwords. The new regulatory framework establishes the role of a central cryptographic agency meant to lead public cryptographic work, creating guidelines and policies for the industry.

Implicit cryptocurrency regulation

The draft of the law was published on May 7 by a Chinese news outlet. The text is largely focused on government centralized password management and does not explicitly mention cryptocurrency, though it does focus on cryptography, a key component underpinning cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

Wan explained:

“The key take away is — the developing of new cryptography, hashing algo, even the usage of the tech, will be in the official legal realm. This means you need to follow the CCP standard for all ‘encrypted’ behaviors, which can be VERY broad, from mining to block propagation.”

Preparing for China’s national crypto

She concluded that the law is building the foundation for the upcoming Chinese national cryptocurrency, though there is no official timetable for its launch, one Chinese official confirmed in September.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, China’s President Xi Jinping has called for the country to accelerate its adoption of blockchain technologies.

Meanwhile, this past week, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg warned that Chinese superiority in the digital currency space could put the U.S. dollar at risk in an attempt to sell lawmakers his plans for the Libra stablecoin.

""China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months. We can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate,” he argued in an official statement.",,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-hits-five-week-high-above-10000,"Bitcoin’s price was quoted in five digits across cryptocurrency exchanges earlier today, but the breakout into $10,000 was short-lived.

The number one cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $10,350 at 01:45 UTC – the highest level since Sept. 24 – according to Bitstamp data. Meanwhile, the global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, clocked a high of $10,332.

Just 24 hours ago, the cryptocurrency was reeling under bearish pressures below $7,500 and prominent chart analysts were calling a deeper drop, courtesy of the so-called “death cross” – a bearish cross of long-term moving averages.

BTC, however, picked up a bid around $7,500 in the early U.S. trading hours on Friday and rose to $8,800 at 17:20 UTC. Prices then consolidated in the narrow range of $8,500 to $8,700 for a few hours, before printing highs above $10,000 earlier today. Essentially, the death cross trapped sellers on the wrong side for the fourth time since 2014.

Biggest single-day gain since April

Bitcoin closed (UTC) at $8,662 on Friday, representing a 16.51 percent gain on the day, as per Bitstamp data. That is the biggest single-day rise since April 2. Back then, BTC had rallied 18.45 percent from $4,133 to $5,080.

Further, the rise from lows below $7,400 to highs above $10,300 is reportedly the third-largest 24-hour price gain in bitcoin’s history, as pointed out by crypto-asset analyst Yassine Elmandjra.

Experts have associated the latest double-digit surge with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s comments that the world’s second-largest economy should accelerate its adoption of the blockchain technology. After all, China was one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies during the 2017 bull run.

Prominent observers like Anthony Pompliano are of the opinion that the Chinese president’s public support of the blockchain technology will force the U.S. and other major nations to embrace the technology, perhaps boosting bitcoin.

The investor community, therefore, is expecting the rally to continue. Some observers, however, are worried that the market optimism is premature, as China is developing a digital version of its own currency and is unlikely to lift its ban on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

It remains to be seen whether Xi’s comments power further gains in BTC. The cryptocurrency is losing altitude at press time.

As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,320 on Bitstamp, representing a $1,000-plus drop from the Asian session high of $10,350. Technical charts indicate a bullish breakout would be confirmed if prices find acceptance above $9,750.

Daily chart

The daily chart shows early signs of a bullish reversal. For instance, bitcoin’s convincing move above $8,352 (Oct. 21 high) has invalidated the bearish lower highs setup. The cryptocurrency has also violated resistance at $8,820 (horizontal line).

However, the cryptocurrency is yet to exit the falling channel, represented by trendlines connecting June 26 and Aug. 6 highs and July 17 and Sept. 26 lows.

A UTC close above the upper edge of the bearish channel, currently at $9,750, would imply a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 seen on April 2 and put the cryptocurrency on the path to re-test of the high of $13,880 hit in June.

Put simply, a channel breakout is needed to confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

After tumbling to as low as $7,300 in the middle of last week bitcoin BTCUSD, -0.16% shot up to over $10,000 on some exchanges overnight Friday and Saturday, for its biggest single-day rise since April 2, before falling again to around $9,000 according to Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.

Bitcoin remains well off its 2019 high of $12,920 reached in June, though prices are still more than double where they started the year.

Other major cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, litecoin, Ripple’s XRP, and bitcoin cash rallied between 7% and 23%, adding billions to the value of the combined cryptocurrency market.

The number one cryptocurrency by market value jumped to $10,350 on Friday the highest level since Sept. 24 according to Bitstamp data.

The rise from lows below $7,400 to highs above $10,300 is reportedly the third-largest 24-hour price gain in bitcoin’s history.

Many bitcoin and cryptocurrency market analysts pointed to comments made by China’s president President Xi Jinping that the country should “seize the opportunity” of bitcoin’s blockchain technology as the reason behind bitcoin’s sudden rally, according to Coindesk citing China’s Xinhua news agency.

China banned bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges in 2017 and some took Xi’s blockchain comments on Friday as a sign the country could ease bitcoin and crypto restrictions.

“We must take the blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies,” Xi reportedly said, speaking at the 18th collective study of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in Beijing.

“We must clarify the main direction, increase investment, focus on a number of key core technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain technology and industrial innovation,” Xi said.

The Standing Committee of the 13th National People’s Congress in China has passed a new law regulating cryptography on Oct. 26 that will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020, China’s CCTV reported.

The new regulatory framework aims to set standards for the application of cryptography and the management of passwords and establishes the role of a central cryptographic agency meant to lead public cryptographic work, creating guidelines and policies for the industry.

Since a 2017 decision by the People’s Bank of China, cryptocurrencies are banned in the country, although a digital renminbi is being developed by the central bank and likely to launch soon.

China was one of the biggest sources of demand for cryptocurrencies during the 2017 bull run.

Some bitcoin analysts see the Chinese president’s public support of the blockchain technology forcing the U.S. and other major nations to embrace the technology, perhaps boosting bitcoin prices.

“It’s bullish for the entire crypto industry, in general, when you have the leader of one of the world’s largest economies coming to embrace blockchain technology like this,” eToro senior market analyst Mati Greenspan said.

However, bitcoin volumes have been struggling recently, leaving the market especially vulnerable to so-called “whales” placing large orders or liquidating short positions and the expiry of the CME bitcoin futures contract US:BTCV19 may have exaggerated Friday’s move, according to Gabor Gurbacs of VanEck Associates.

Bitcoin trading volume among the top ten biggest bitcoin and crypto exchanges has fallen to under $200 million a day, according to bitcoin and crypto data company Messari, down 20-fold from a peak of $4 billion per day just a few months ago.

Meanwhile, last week, Facebook FB, +3.45% CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned that Chinese superiority in the digital currency space could put the U.S. dollar at risk in an attempt to sell lawmakers his plans for the Libra stablecoin.

“China is moving quickly to launch a similar idea in the coming months. We can’t sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don’t innovate,” he argued.

It garnered so much attention that lawmakers in the United States are holding hearings to review the project. Walmart has been flirting with crypto and blockchain for years. At the time of writing, the top crypto exchange handles a volume of around $50 billion, and Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady around $8,000.

This is clearly a new “mainstreaming” of crypto to the masses, but a growing number of major banks, hedge funds and family offices are also turning to digital assets to build out their traditional investment portfolios.

Academic endowments — including the Harvard Management Company (the largest in the world), the University of Michigan, MIT and others — are diversifying their holdings with cryptocurrency. In February, JPMorgan Chase launched its own JPM Coin. While its token is in the prototype phase and is being tested solely with JPMorgan institutional investment clients, it is the first U.S. bank to create a digital version of fiat currency.

According to a Fidelity survey in May, 47% of institutional investors have an “overwhelmingly favorable” opinion of digital assets. The firm surveyed hundreds of institutional investors including pensions, hedge funds and endowments. The Fidelity study showed that “institutional investors are finding appeal in digital assets and many are looking to invest more in digital assets over the next five years,” but institutional investment into cryptocurrency can be tricky — especially when it comes to security.

Proper custody of digital assets isn’t as easy as locking up gold or paper currency in a bank vault. Since cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) exist completely digitally on a blockchain, and are by nature maintained in a decentralized environment, they present an enticing target for hackers. Moreover, institutions dealing with public and private keys (more on that later) on such a large scale isn’t easy. Secure storage of large digital asset funds is complex, and institutions need safe, comprehensive and integrated storage solutions.

Industry reports have shown that some $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency was stolen in 2018. The threat landscape faced by investors is similar to those facing security professionals in all tech spaces and will only become broader as the industry grows. From social engineering to traditional cyberattack methods like site clones, phishing and SMS hacks to basic hardware tampering, there are many entry points in this new frontier.

Tight security is crucial to anyone involved with digital assets, whether you’re dabbling in altcoins or an insitutitional investor overseeing fortunes in Bitcoin. In the cryptocurrency world, there are several ways to store your holdings, but they all generally involve some form of wallet. Basically, a “crypto wallet” is a device on which your private keys are stored. Your private keys are a critical piece of information used to authorize spending and selling crypto on the blockchain. The wallets in which you hold them can be physical devices, software- or solution- based, or simply the online exchange from which you’ve purchased your currency.

Of these wallets, there are two forms: hot and cold. The distinction between the two of these is that hot wallets are connected to the internet while cold wallets are not. Leaving your crypto on an exchange is an example of hot wallet storage. Naturally, cold wallets are considered safer than hot wallets, as they spend little (or no) time connected to the internet.

Hardware wallets of the cold variety are generally considered the best and safest option for storing cryptocurrency. These are typically in USB format and can be temporarily “hot” in that they can be connected to the internet to facilitate a crypto exchange, but primarily remain offline and disconnected with assets fully isolated and inaccessible to hackers.

While USB-based hardware wallets are undeniably the best way for individuals holding cryptocurrency to protect their investment, they’re not practically viable for enterprises handling millions of dollars’ worth of crypto. In the early stages of institutional investing, asset managers would find themselves securing massive amounts of wealth on hardware wallets with no convenient and efficient way to implement a meaningful segregation of duty. The financial industry needs custody solutions that are more holistic in their approach, combining both hot and cold approaches, and encompassing both hardware and software technology solutions.

The most secure way to manage crypto assets is through an end-to-end, multi-authorization governance infrastructure. Secure storage of large digital asset funds is complex, and exchanges and institutions need safe, comprehensive and integrated solutions. An effective approach employs a multi-authorization, self-custody system of management and gives financial institutions security, control and speed of execution. A reliable governance framework provides instant access to funds without compromising security whether data is at rest or in transit.

Effective cryptocurrency custody solutions should ensure there are no single points of failure within an organization. Think about the QuadrigaCX case in which $163 million disappeared. While that’s now developing into a matter of extreme fraudulence and one bad actor, it showed — on a tremendous scale — the danger that lies in trusting single points of failure.

For the cryptocurrency industry to truly mature, institutional investors are going to have to get involved. Exchanges, brokers, asset managers, over-the-count traders, custodians and others must enforce institutional-grade controls on all transactions. It’s the only way to bring about a new era of stability and trust to this new era of digital asset management.

There’s a lot of unrest in Chile right now as the country has seen massive protests against government manipulation and an escalation of financial problems. Local reports detail a few banking establishments have been burned after customers started having issues withdrawing cash from ATMs. Issues with the bank machines that don’t work coupled with rising inflation, pension cuts, and austerity measures have invoked Chileans to rise up and take to the streets in protest against their government.

State of Unrest in Chile Sees Government Violence and People Unable to Access Cash at ATMs

Chile has been getting a lot of attention lately because the region’s citizens have clashed against the authorities, shaking the country to the core. More than half of Chile’s 16 state regions are locked down under “emergency orders” and must obey a military-backed curfew. It all started when the government-run subway operation Metro de Santiago increased the price of metro tickets to roughly $1.15. To make matters worse, public pensions are unsustainable even though its creator José Piñera calls Chile’s pension framework the “Mercedes-Benz” of infrastructure.

Pensions are being cut or not being paid and to top it off Chile’s bureaucracy increased electrical costs in the country by 10%. After the hike in metro ticket fares, students started hopping the station’s turnstile every day in protest. Marta Lagos, an executive from the polling company Latinobarometro says the last few decades of politicians have sparked the unrest.

“The students jumped the turnstiles, and as it happens in revolutions, the elements that trigger a social phenomenon are not very rational,” Lagos said. “It’s not just this government — This has been accumulating in the last four governments.”

Chileans Have Access to Tools That Can Strengthen Financial Inclusion

During the last two weeks, the situation in Chile has escalated and according to various regional reports, the military has been extremely violent toward protesters. One person who has a friend from Chile writes: “The Chilean government is murdering innocent people on the streets, I have a friend in Chile — She said she has no access to money and they’ve closed all of the supermarkets, ATMs are locked. This is who we are up against — People are getting mass murdered by the government.”

Just wow. This is Chile today. But one million people marching in the street isn’t newsworthy to the Western media when they’re protesting against a corrupt, US-backed regime I guess. 🤗 #ChileProtests pic.twitter.com/vDZ4fiLzsR — Sarah Abdallah (@sahouraxo) October 26, 2019

There are various reports throughout the weekend backing up the claim that ATMs are not operational and people are having issues accessing their funds. Supermarkets are also running out of food and the Chilean people have seen food shortages in certain districts.

Without being able to access cash, Chilean residents have resorted to barter and the use of cryptocurrencies. There are traders in Chile who are buying and selling bitcoin cash (BCH) using bank transfers and gift cards via local.Bitcoin.com. The platform is a peer-to-peer marketplace that allows users from around the world to buy and sell bitcoin cash in a noncustodial fashion. Governments have been committing crimes against peaceful citizens worldwide and with massive protests in Argentina, Venezuela, Hong Kong, France, and Lebanon, people are finding the benefits of borderless and permissionless electronic cash.

Cryptocurrencies allow people to access their hard-earned funds when they want to without a state-run financial institution stopping them. The path toward freedom in Chile will not be found solely in cryptocurrencies, but Chileans can use them as a tool to bypass ridiculous restrictions. Platforms and marketplaces like local.Bitcoin.com will be there to help spread the effort for economic freedom, not only in Chile but on a global level.

Designed usually as peer-to-peer payment platforms, cryptocurrencies seek to improve trust, security and privacy by significantly reducing or eliminating third parties. However, by connecting users directly, cryptocurrencies make regulatory oversight far more complex.

The regulatory control that most governments seek is generally related to money laundering and illegal activity. While cryptocurrency creators have no desire to foster such practices, many nevertheless hope to move away from the sorts of regulatory controls that are seen as centralized, less cost-efficient and often domineering.

To Libra or not to Libra?

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s newest offering to the tech world is a proprietary cryptocurrency called Libra. Designed as a means of P2P payments on the Facebook platform, Zuckerberg had hoped that his creation would mimic Bitcoin to a degree.

Initially the response from insiders was a sense of profound excitement. A host of tech giants signed on financial partners. The news was all about how Libra could change the world, particularly the 1.7 billion adults who remain unbanked across the globe.

However, as government agencies have begun offering feedback, the fires have cooled substantially. Most recently, Lael Brainard, one of the governors of the United States Federal Reserve, has stated unequivocally that Libra cannot see the light of day until a number of regulatory standards have been met. What’s more, other analysts have made even stronger statements about the dangers of Libra, and the potential it has to damage society.

The result has been a massive exodus from the system. Seven of the largest funding partners — including PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and eBay — have all made a hasty retreat from the company. And others are threatening to do the same, as U.S. and international regulators, like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) continue to clamp down on the new system by offering stricter guidelines on how digital transactions should be managed. One major concern of regulators is that Libra could heavily disrupt the global financial system and potentially be subverted for money laundering or terrorist financing.

While not immediately impactful for Bitcoin, this new guidance from the Federal Reserve suggests that coins that do not offer good regulatory control may come under fire. For example, privacy coins like Monero and Dash are under serious scrutiny. These coins offer users complete anonymity in transactions through the use of blockchain technology — a particularly odious feature for regulators.

If not Libra, then…?

However, while this gap between privacy-based cryptocurrencies and regulators appears to be growing increasingly wide, other coins and platforms have moved into the space, hoping to provide solutions that are meaningful and helpful for regulators.

Related: What Role Should Central Banks Have Launching Stablecoins Like Libra?

For that reason, platforms such as Particl and Verge, for example, are coming online that allow exchanges to offer some level of regulatory oversight, but still maintain the desired privacy and P2P transactions that cryptocurrency users are pursuing.

As a community governance example, Particl is designed with internal regulation, in that it allows for private transactions but also a secondary level of internal governance through user voting. By allowing users to vote against listings that don't conform to the community guidelines, the system is internally regulating. This type of solution offers a middle road between regulators seeking some level of control and the complete anonymity of coins like Zcash and Monero.

Other platforms are also seeking solutions that mix private and public transactions. For example, Dash offers private internal transactions between users but requires the coins to be “mixed” with other coins to provide the desired privacy. The founders believe the network should be able to meet the necessary compliance suggestions from FATF.

According to Dash CEO Ryan Taylor, “Dash is identical to Bitcoin and is 100% capable of meeting the requirements.”

Others, like DeepOnion, are moving in the opposite direction, building on The Onion Router, or TOE, darknet and moving away from any oversight whatsoever. These platforms assume that government will never allow private-style transactions, and are therefore moving underground.

Working together for change

While the potential to hide from government will always be there, it seems clear that digital coins that seek a middle ground with regulators pose the greatest hope for mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. New systems that offer a certain level of control (even if only through users) but remain private, allow for a hybrid option that may well represent the future of digital money.

Related: What Does Skepticism for Libra Say About Bitcoin?

Such systems bring regulators and cryptophiles together. Facebook has promised to work tirelessly with regulators to help bridge the gaps that currently exist. But the departure of its key funding and supportive partners may tell a different story. What’s more, while the coin may offer some benefits for users, other decentralized platforms adhere more carefully to Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of a peer-to-peer, digital payment system that is fully decentralized but also highly scalable, safe and secure.

While companies have executed permutations of Satoshi’s original vision, most would not deny that clear, consistent and reasonable regulation is required for mass adoption of cryptocurrencies. But ultimately, the cryptocurrencies and systems that do the best job of finding a middle ground between their benefits and regulatory oversight will be the ones that survive and thrive.

There are many pitfalls one can easily get caught in when using, storing, investing or trading cryptocurrencies. While some mistakes could cost you a fortune, most of the common ones can easily be avoided. Bitcoin.com has produced a video featuring the top seven deadly mistakes crypto owners should avoid.

Common Mistakes for All Crypto Owners

Bitcoin.com has released its latest installment of the “top lists” video series. The video, entitled “7 Deadly Crypto Sins You’ll Want to Avoid,” highlights seven of the most common mistakes crypto owners could fall for with explanations of how they can be avoided. Some are aimed at all crypto owners and uses while others are more for investors and traders.

One of the top mistakes featured in the video is not backing up your wallet. “If you lose access to your private keys due to loss, theft, or damage, you lose access to your money, and it’s lost forever,” the video describes. A device holding your wallet can be broken, lost, stolen, and the backup is the only way to retrieve your funds. News.Bitcoin.com has written several guides on the subject. For example, we have an explainer on how to restore a bitcoin mobile phone wallet onto a fresh device using a mnemonic seed phrase, a guide on how to restore a hardware wallet using a seed phrase, and a list of ways you might go about storing your wallet recovery phrase.

The video also explains the mishaps that can occur when mixing up different forks and how they can be prevented. For example, when BCH forked from BTC, some users claimed to have lost their BCH by sending their coins to BTC addresses.

Some common mistakes concern how to store your coins. While it is easy and convenient to store them in hot wallets, there have been many instances where security breaches have wiped out all the coins kept in them. Similarly, keeping your coins at crypto exchanges is also risky, as they are often targets of hackers and many of them do not have adequate security measures. When they are hacked, you may not get all your funds back. Mt. Gox’s creditors, for example, are still struggling to get their money back to this day.

Other recent exchange hack examples include Binance which was hacked in May and lost about 7,000 BTC; Bitpoint Japan which lost about $32 million worth of cryptocurrency when it was hacked in July; Coincheck which lost about $534 million worth of XEM when it was hacked in January last year; and South Korean exchange Bithumb which was hacked several times over the years.

Some Mistakes When Trading Crypto

The video also features some common mistakes when investing or trading cryptocurrencies. Two very common ones are market timing and investing more than you can afford to lose. When the price is rising, it is very tempting to do both. Similarly, when the market is down, there is a strong tendency among some traders to sell and cut their losses.

“Of course, we often hear the success stories in the media, however, the many losses that have been incurred by participants seeking to time the market have been swept under the carpet,” explained Kyle Cox, a senior investment analyst at Invictus Capital. Here are some examples of how crypto traders are handling bear markets, and one Chinese trader told his story of how he lost 9,000 BTC.

The video below explores the above mistakes in more detail, how to avoid them, and the rest of the top seven deadly sins.

The 200-day moving average (MA) is often regarded as a marker for bullish long-term health when prices are above and bearish long-term market health when prices reside below.



Bitcoin’s (BTC) 30 percent jump to 5-week highs from $7,393 to $10,350 over a 2-day period pulled prices back above the long-term moving average, marking a change in both momentum and sentiment for the world’s premiere crypto.

Bitcoin SV (BSV) already led the charge a day earlier, closing above the 200-day MA on Oct. 25.

Still, those moves are yet to be reflected in the remaining top 10 cryptos as the bulls struggle for supremacy from the consistent 4-month downward slide that began towards the end of June, 2019.

BTC and BSV – Daily chart

As seen above, BTC and BSV both managed to rise above the 200-day MA with conviction, leading to expectations for further appreciation in price as it heads toward the monthly close for October.

Still, significant leg work for the remaining eight cryptos out of the top 10 is required to convince traders of a major change in trend for altcoins, which could encourage further investment in projects such as Ether and XRP as optimism begins to build off China’s positive pivot towards crypto.

Altcoins – Daily chart

XRP, Ether, Litecoin, bitcoin cash, EOS, Binance coin and Stellar still reside beneath the 200-day MA despite gaining between 11.45 and 22 percent in a single period on Oct. 26.

The weekend move caught many traders off-guard as BTC broke out on its third-best single-day price gain in its history, as noted by Yassine Elmandjra.

Still, more is required from buyers looking to drive alternative crypto’s performances higher, which is currently mired by BTC’s near 70 percent market dominance.

Should the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies follow suit by rising above their respective 200-day moving averages, that would add credence to further price gains as the markets head toward the BTC halving event in May 2020.

Confidence in BTC has been restored for now, but how long that will last and to what effect it has on the rest of the top 10 remains to be seen.

In a dramatic price surge of around $50 billion in market capitalization, Bitcoin rocketed from below $7,500 USD to a high briefly exceeding $10,000 in less than 24 hours on October 25th.

Since this time, BTC prices have remained relatively buoyant, now pushing back to $9500 after flirting with $9,000.

(CoinGecko)

Numerous narratives and responses have since emerged.

The surge was among the greatest single-day climbs in Bitcoin’s history, exceeding 40% at one point in time, before settling back into the lower $9K range.

Nic Carter, co-founder of CoinMetrics, noted on Twitter that, had the price closed above the $10k mark, it would have made for the third highest single-day return in Bitcoin’s history, surpassed only by two occasions early in Bitcoin’s rise to popularity.

These two previous climbs saw Bitcoin rise in price by 54% and 48% within 24 hours, but they also occurred when the price of one bitcoin was at a significantly lower valuation.

Yassine Elmandjra tweeted that the previous two times Bitcoin experienced such positive price swings, it was only trading at $0.40 in 2010, and $5.65 in 2011.

Many on Twitter took the opportunity to take a few jabs at the always Bitcoin-bearish gold bug Peter Schiff, who theorized on October 23rd that BTC was due for a severe drop.

Schiff suggested the recent “head-and-shoulder” formation confirmed a bearish move toward $6K, and pointed to a likely plunge toward a disastrous $1K. In fact, Schiff’s predictions are so often the exact opposite of what actually happens, the SEC might want to check his Bitcoin trades…

Not only has #Bitcoin broken out of its bear flag pattern, projecting a move to $6K, but the head and shoulders pattern that I mention was forming over the weekend has now been confirmed as well. If this pattern completes it projects a much larger decline, perhaps as low as $1K! — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 23, 2019

Even CIA-agent-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden joined in the fun, posting an image referring to the famed 4Chan wizard, who correctly predicted previous BTC price marks.

The bold predictions correctly stated April’s $5,300 and the even bolder $9,200 July price — both gutsy calls considering the market sentiment at the time was extremely bearish during a brutal crypto winter.

Of course, this only gives the market a few days for a run to $16K, according to this person, leaving one to wonder at the near-term possibilities.

While many theorized that the price movement was associated with excitement due to Chinese Presidential declarations of a major push in blockchain-research and investment, the reality is likely far simpler.

With potential profits on leveraged action via markets like BitMEX, traders were stopped out or liquidated in heavy action that caused a severe short squeeze. An all-time high volume boost to 1183 contracts in physically-settled BTC futures on Bakkt would have further added to the greedy sentiment.

This followed the exact opposite pattern last week, when cover for the long squeeze was provided by Libra’s Congressional hearing. Volatility is what draws traders to Bitcoin: and what worries legislators about its manipulation.

Where To Now?

Market sentiment and volume have remained relatively uncertain, according to data provided by TheTIE.io. Yet, volumes on BTC trading are matching the highest observed levels in more than a year — around $45 billion in 24 hours — with the previous high-mark hitting the same volume in July, when BTC was selling for $13,000 USD.

Prices are hovering in the highly-unpredictable range, with room for significant movement in either direction. With another volume crunch on Bakkt, paired with some excitement on leveraged BitMEX trades and a little self-fulfilling 4Chan Wizard prophecy trading behavior, $16K might just be in reach for October’s end.

Unfortunately, so might $6K. Such is the nature of trading Bitcoin. We wouldn’t have it any other way.",2019-10-27 14:03:01+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/where-to-spend-bitcoin-a-global-overview-from-ljubljana-to-zurich,"There’s no easy way to buy, send or spend cryptocurrency in person — not even for a slice of pizza or a cup of coffee, or so it’s been said. Meanwhile, the number of physical merchant locations that accept crypto payments keeps growing.

As of late October 2019, 15,558 business venues worldwide were accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a method of payment, up 18% from a year earlier, according to Coinmap.org. The crowdsourced heatmap, devised by Satoshi Labs in 2013, draws on input from consumers and merchants.

It also offers up some surprises. While Europe remains the hottest continent for in-person Bitcoin transactions, the most torrid city is now Ljubljana in Slovenia, with 314 venues. Last year, Prague held that distinction. As reported by Cointelegraph, more than 530 locations across Slovenia and Croatia are now accepting crypto on a daily basis, including hotels, shops and restaurants — a big increase from the 240 locations reported in January 2019. The list includes Tus, one of Slovenia’s biggest grocery chains. Ljubljana even has a shopping mall called “BTC City.”

The extent to which the Republic of Slovenia, with only 2 million citizens, is becoming a hub for crypto can be seen in the table below, which ranks Bitcoin-accepting businesses by city on a per capita basis. That is, the size of the population is being controlled, since it would be expected for a city like London with 8.2 million residents to have more Bitcoin-accepting venues than Ljubljana with only 275,000 residents, even though it doesn’t, London has a mere 103 businesses.

The table shows that Ljubljana has more than 10 times the number of Bitcoin-accepting locations as does San Francisco after controlling for population. St. Petersburg, Florida has more than 11 times as many places to spend crypto as New York per capita. Here are the top 10 cities in gross terms (i.e., not adjusted for population):

This table is dominated by European, North American and South American cities. Switzerland’s businesses have long been (relatively) receptive to crypto, and this is reflected in the larger size of its Bitcoin-accepting businesses. Zurich’s Dolder Grand, a luxury hotel, takes Bitcoin, as does the Kessel car dealership in Zug.

By comparison, a walk through midtown Manhattan in New York City, home to some of the most storied names in retailing, finds mostly smaller enterprises willing to be paid in BTC: Forefront Law Group, Gotham Cookies, Toggle Web Media Design, etc. Paris’ famous high-end Rue de Rivoli has virtually no businesses accepting Bitcoin.

In Prague, one can reportedly rent apartments and attend films paying in crypto. The Valmont, a party bar in the city center, invites visitors to ""drink champagne and dance on the table"" — and accepts Bitcoin. In economically distressed Venezuela, Traki, a big department store, is now taking crypto — at least according to one user who purchased clothing and school supplies with BTC.

Bitcoin-friendly businesses are to be found in Australia’s two largest cities, Sydney (55) and Melbourne (66), but there are relatively few in Asia given its size apart from Seoul (71), Hong Kong (39), Bangkok (52) and Tokyo (81), the continent’s leader. Africa remains almost “heat-free” on Coinmap’s heatmap. Cape Town, South Africa, the continental leader, has 31 businesses accepting Bitcoin.

Why so disinterested?

There have been many reasons offered why crypto doesn’t work for everyday transactions. When online payments company Stripe, one of the first major infrastructure networks to support Bitcoin payments in 2014, exited that business last year, it cited among other reasons the transaction clearance times, which were averaging 60 minutes in mid-2018, and had sometimes dragged on for days. “By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it’s for the ‘wrong’ amount,” the company said.

Some of the newer payment platforms, however, claim that crypto payments made in BTC and Ethereum (ETH), or other cryptos, can be almost immediately converted into a merchant’s local currency, eliminating exposure to sudden price movements.

Hupayx, a South Korean startup, for instance, offers a cryptocurrency point of sale payment solution through a partnership with KIS Information Technologies. It will soon be implemented at more than 400,000 locations in Seoul area alone, according to Aibek Amandanov, the head of global marketing. He told Cointelegraph that duty free shops will be among the first businesses, adding:

“HUPAYX members can transfer crypto instantly among members; when transferring outside our ecosystem it takes longer. When paying at the counter at HPOS supported merchants, we only charge a 0.5% fee and it takes less than 6 seconds to transact.”

Changing scene?

Bitcoin transaction costs have dropped dramatically over the past two years — high fees were another reason cited by Stripe for leaving the business. The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached a high of $54.90 on Dec. 21, 2017, but on Oct. 22, 2019, it was less than one hundredth that amount: $0.53 per transaction.

There are other impediments, though, before in-person crypto payments become part of everyday life. In South Korea, it is prohibited to directly pay in crypto at any store or business location, Amandanov told Cointelegraph: “In response, we made our wallet so that the crypto (BTC, ETH, ETH-20 tokens) can be converted into points and can be paid with those.”

In the U.S., there can be tax issues because the IRS considers Bitcoin and other cryptos an asset, not a currency. Every time a sale takes place, it can be considered a tax event. How to deal with this? Casual Bitcoin users should consider using a reputable crypto wallet provider to help document all transactions, according to tax expert William Perez. Wild variations in crypto prices haven’t helped either. As a spokesperson for Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis firm, explained to Cointelegraph:

“One significant impediment is price volatility. That's likely behind the rise in popularity of stablecoins, and trust in stablecoins could lead the way to increased commercial use… We think a lot of the benefits of using cryptocurrencies versus traditional payment methods are still to come because cryptocurrencies are more programmable.”

“There’s been definite technical progress in the past year, but no massive adoption on the retail level,” Nick Saponaro, co-founder and chief information officer of The Divi Project, a blockchain startup, told Cointelegraph. “People just aren’t willing to spend an asset with such upside potential.”

There is more in-person crypto spending in places like South America and Africa, Saponaro added. In Venezuela, ravaged by hyperinflation, the local currency is useless, and people are turning to cryptocurrencies to purchase groceries. In economically distressed parts of Africa, people use BTC to purchase vehicles, he said.

All told, a different popular psychology may have to take hold before people begin to spend cryptocurrencies on goods and services more substantial than a pizza slice or a cup of coffee, Saponaro suggested.

Consumers will have to see others purchasing durable goods like automobiles and home appliances with Bitcoin or Ether or other cryptos. When they do, some price stability may be achieved, and then more consumers might jump in and spend crypto, in a kind of virtuous cycle.",,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-big-lie-perpetuated-by-central-banks/,"The Big Lie Perpetuated by Central Banks

The central banking system controls monetary policy within a given jurisdiction, including the creation of money itself. The system is a lie and a denial of reality. The lie is political in motivation and content, and the denial of reality is rooted in culture and philosophy.

Ethical Relativism and Central Banking

The political lie: Central banks are said to facilitate commerce and to benefit customers by connecting them globally. They purport to guarantee money and the safety of transactions. In fact, central banks are a chokepoint for commerce, which benefits the elite at the expense of ordinary people. Their mandated fiat constitutes the largest, longest, and farthest-reaching financial scam ever perpetuated. The fiat-money scam is committed by the political class upon productive people. The central banks’ transactions are the opposite of what is claimed; they betray customers in order to enrich the state with access to the wealth and personal information of average people.

The philosophical lie: To sustain a massive falsehood over time, facts must be constantly denied. Otherwise, people will hold the scam up to reality and check it against evidence. The falsehood needs to blur the truth, or destroy it, so that facts become discredited. If the lie is successful over time, people come to believe that the way things are right now—what they are told is “true”—is the way things have always been and must always be. Nothing but the lie is practical or possible.

How Things Used to Be

It wasn’t always this way, and history is the greatest reality check of all. The depravity of paper money was once common political knowledge, for example. Consider America’s Founding Fathers.

“Paper money has had the effect in your state that it will ever have, to ruin commerce, oppress the honest, and open the door to every species of fraud and injustice.” George Washington, the first U.S. President.

“Paper money is unjust; to creditors, if a legal tender; to debtors, if not legal tender, by increasing the difficulty of getting specie. It is unconstitutional, for it affects the rights of property as much as taking away equal value in land. It is pernicious, destroying confidence between individuals; discouraging commerce…” James Madison, “Father of the Constitution.”

“To emit an unfunded paper as the sign of value ought not to continue a formal part of the Constitution, nor ever hereafter to be employed; being, in its nature, pregnant with abuses, and liable to be made the engine of imposition and fraud; holding out temptations equally pernicious to the integrity of government and to the morals of the people.” Alexander Hamilton, first Treasury Secretary.

In a May 1788 letter, Thomas Jefferson—author of the Declaration of Independence—used an interesting word to describe paper money: “ghost.”

“There is no saying where this fire [bankruptcies in London] will end. Perhaps in the general conflagration of all their paper. If not now, it must ere long. With only 20 millions of coin, and three or four hundred million of circulating paper, public and private, nothing is necessary but a general panic, produced either by failures, invasion or any other cause, and the whole visionary fabric vanishes into air and shews that paper is poverty, that it is only the ghost of money, and not money itself.” In 1817, Jefferson added that paper money’s “abuses also are inevitable and, by breaking up the measure of value, make a lottery of all private property.”

The Ghost of Money

As accurate as the other Founding Fathers were, Jefferson pointed to a more fundamental issue. Paper currency was “the ghost of money”; coins were the reality. They were opposites of each other, like lies and truth, with one being a phantom and the other being the substance of life. Paper money is not merely an expression of and a pathway to corruption, it is also an existential parallel to free-market money. (“Existential” here means that fiat affirms the existence of money by being a “ghost” of it, even while contradicting money’s substance.)

The challenge for central banks is to make the phantom seem real and the reality seem fraudulent. One way to do so is to question the validity of objective reality itself. After all, if there is no objective reality—if reality is dictated by authorities, the narrative, the majority, or other subjective forces—then there is nothing factual against which to assess anything. When nothing is objectively false or true, a lie is as valid as the truth.

Ethical Relativism

We live in a culture of relativism, which supports the denial of reality—a denial that sustains the pervasive lie of central banking. Ethical relativism argues that there is no absolute truth; no objective standard or empirical evidence underlies ethics and personal judgment. Ethical relativism can be divided into different categories:

Descriptive ethical relativism studies people’s beliefs about morality, often focusing upon the beliefs of collectives such as tribes or specific societies. It is sometimes called “comparative” because it contrasts different approaches.

Meta-ethical relativism claims that moral judgments are not true or false in any provable or objective sense; they are relative to a perspective or circumstances—that is, they are subjective. This idea underlies all relativism.

Normative moral relativism, a subset of normative ethics, asks how people should act. Relativism answers that no moral standards bind all men at all times because right and wrong are not universal. Killing an innocent man is not always wrong, for example.

(The opposite of Ethical Relativism is Absolutism—the doctrine that actions are intrinsically right or wrong. Killing an innocent person is inherently wrong, even if it is done for the greater good or some other perceived benefit.)

A venue in which many people encounter ethical relativism in a pure form is in introductory college courses in philosophy. The professor poses a hypothetical in order to make students re-examine their ethical codes. The scenario usually runs, “The entire nation of France will drop dead tomorrow morning unless you kill your neighbor who is an innocent man. What do you do?” Or:“You can eliminate cancer by pressing a button that will also kill one healthy person who is an innocent man. Do you push the button?”

Such questions are illusions of a moral dilemma; they are ghosts. They are supposed to pit the moral horror of participating in mass murder against the moral horror of killing an innocent person in order to make a student conclude that there is no correct choice. Morality is relative, not absolute. But the questions are ghosts because they cannot be honestly answered. They postulate a parallel world in which the rules of reality, like cause and effect, have been so dramatically changed that pushing a button cures cancer. This world operates on magic, not objective reality.

The Truthful Response to a False Dichotomy

Actually, there is one honest answer: “Because my ethics and actions are based on the facts and physical rules of the world around me, I don’t know what I would do if those facts and rules no longer existed. If I were in a totally different reality, I’m sure my ethics and actions would be different, but I don’t know how.” This answer is the opposite of what the faux dilemmas are intended to elicit, of course, because it asserts reality rather than blurring it.

And, yet, this sort of question is commonly viewed as a “tough” moral issue. After all, how can the life of one person outweigh that of millions? This query is another intellectual sleight of hand. Morality is being reduced to a numbers game, a cost-benefit analysis, rather than a matter of principle. The subject is now utilitarianism, not ethics, as the professor claims. This is the destruction of objective morality. Into the resulting vacuum, utilitarianism rushes, usually in the company of expert opinion and authoritative pronouncements.

Right and Wrong Are Not All Relative

What is right or wrong is one of the most fundamental decisions a person can make. If the person is persuaded to abdicate his ethical judgment to an authority or a gray zone—if there is no objective morality or reality—then all decisions and judgments are based on relativism.

The implications of this for central banking are twofold: a moral and a metaphysical relativism that benefits lies.

Central banking is immoral. Fiat money and its inevitable inflation are theft; the banking monopoly robs people of opportunity and prosperity; the punishment of financial dissenters, such as black marketeers, negates freedom by denying individuals the use of their own property. This is a problem for central banking because it is an oppressive double standard, and people rebel against blatant injustice. The problem of backlash against a double standard can be eliminated, however, by removing morality itself from the picture. Without objective morality, there is no objective justice. Everything is a matter of authority, expert opinion, circumstance, and utility.

Three-Pronged Propaganda

Central banking is a metaphysical lie that requires the discrediting of fact. Lies are used to establish the superiority of state-controlled finances over a privately-controlled system and so gin up people’s compliance. The propaganda is basically three-pronged.

1) Private alternatives are depicted as either criminal or fraught with danger – or both. The criminal accusations against cryptocurrency, for example, include human trafficking, tax evasion, drug dealing, and money laundering; the accusations are incredibly exaggerated and equally valid against fiat currency. The dangers include fraud, ransom attacks (blackmail), and the free market. Fraud and blackmail are not unique to crypto, of course, and the free-market cure for both is the exercise of due diligence and protective technology.

The demonization of the free market is a different matter; it is political and philosophical. Self-interest and voluntary exchange are vilified for the sole reason that they are antithetical to the state. The free market is the state’s main competition because it actually provides what the state promises but cannot deliver: freedom, prosperity, peace, and a civil society. Competition is not permitted, especially when it is effective.

2) The state argues that its financial institutions are public goods while private alternatives are ruthless, chaotic, and incompetent systems that offer no recourse to exploited individuals. The smear campaign is backed up by a horde of authorities who are a mixture of the scholarly, the bureaucratic, and the heavily armed. Above all, people must be discouraged from comparing the current financial system with alternatives from the past or possibilities in the future that would call the lie into question. As in the philosophy class, the rules of reality must be altered; in this case, the rules of the marketplace must be discredited.

3) Some people always see through the propaganda. These people are targeted and punished for acting on their disagreement in order to discourage others from doing so. This is the point at which propaganda becomes a gun.

Mendacious Money-Printers

The central banks know truth from lies; they know what they are doing. “Dutch National Bank Says Gold Can Re-Start Economy in Case of Total Collapse.” The De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) or Dutch Central Bank recently acknowledged that its system of lies was faltering. DNB stated, “if the [central banking] system collapses, the gold stock can serve as a basis to build it up again. Gold bolsters confidence in the stability of the central bank’s balance sheet and creates a sense of security.”

The statement is a rare admission of reality. Central banking’s structure has become so transparently unstable and fraudulent that people have lost their confidence and sense of security in it. Central banks now pin their hopes on a store of value that is supported by five centuries of history and private choice – gold. Many hedge even this relatively safe bet by forging or incorporating digital currencies, often backed by gold or other hard commodities. Central bankers realize that the smoke they have been blowing into mirrors needs to be rescued by a form of wealth that people trust.

As central banking crumbles, so does the lie. The truth can’t come soon enough.

Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Baudriallard used to say: There’s only one way to go from here!

Bitcoin Price

We closed the day, October 26 2019, at a price of $9,244. That’s a decent 6.66 percent increase in 24 hours, or $577. It was the highest closing price in thirty-two days.

We’re still 53 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).

Bitcoin market cap

Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $166,547,360,782. It now commands 68 percent of the total crypto market.

Bitcoin volume

Yesterday’s volume of $44,496,255,609 was the highest in one hundred and twenty-one days, 186 percent above the year’s average, and 1 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transactions

A total of 305,582 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 8 percent below the year’s average and 32 percent below the year’s high.

Bitcoin transaction fee

Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.59. That’s $3.12 below the year’s high of $3.71.

Bitcoin distribution by address

As of now, there are 13,241 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 5.6 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.5 percent, and the top 1000 34.5 percent.

Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin

With a market capitalization of $168 billion, China Mobile has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.

Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million

On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee predicted that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.

He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 92.5 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $124,152 by now, according to dickline.info.

Bitcoin Energy Consumption

Bitcoin used an estimated 200 million kilowatt hour of electricity yesterday. On a yearly basis that would amount to 73 terawatt hour. That’s the equivalent of Austria’s energy consumption or 6,770,506 US households. Bitcoin’s energy consumption now represents 0.3% of the whole world’s electricity use.

Bitcoin on Twitter

Yesterday 25,470 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 36.4 percent above the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.

Most popular posts about Bitcoin

This was yesterday’s most engaged tweet about Bitcoin:

But it’s not working out in practice. The cryptocurrency has generated far more hype and wild investment speculation than practical use.

The energy consumption required to continue this speculative bubble is tremendous. Maintaining the Bitcoin network currently consumes more electricity than entire nations like Switzerland. This is due to the proof-of-work requirement to secure the blockchain: huge amounts of computer hardware, endlessly churning away at cracking an essentially pointless mathematical problem. And it’s happening at a time when we need to conserve energy and reduce CO2 emissions to avert climate change, not to mention when 1.1 billion people have no access to electricity at all.

What’s truly perverse is that this vast computational effort is intentionally wasted: as Emin Gun Sirer pointed out, if the proof-of-work was used on something useful, such as running computational models for science, it might set some expectation for the value of Bitcoin based on how much people value the work it can do.

Byzantine Reliable Broadcast

It doesn’t have to be this way. Indeed, a new paper from Swiss researchers titled Scalable Byzantine Reliable Broadcast is one of many that show the way towards more efficient, scalable, and effective cryptocurrencies.

Blockchain aims to create a secure, unhackable record of transactions by essentially distributing its ledger of all transactions to everyone who uses it. Adding new data to the blockchain requires proof of work—cracking those cryptographic algorithms. This is intended to make it impossible for anyone to disrupt the blockchain by adding incorrect data. Essentially, this requirement does away with the need for a trusted third party like Visa, Paypal, or the banking system which keeps a single, indisputable record of transactions.

The problem of ensuring that a distributed system of information remains invulnerable to some malicious users who aim to disrupt it is called the Byzantine General’s problem, from which the paper takes its name, using the analogy of army generals attempting to coordinate an attack while a traitor in their midst sends out misleading information.

But the new paper argues that you can prevent anyone from cheating in the distributed system without needing total consensus on behalf of everyone using the blockchain for every transaction.

Trust Goes Viral

Instead of using one ledger maintained by every user, the new algorithm essentially works like a virus (or a viral meme). When a user makes a transaction, a small group of additional users is passed information about that transaction. They then pass this information to another small group of users. The information spreads out exponentially, quickly reaching billions of users.

Then, instead of consulting a single ledger, transactions are verified by a random sample of users. If the random sample is large enough, you can ensure that malicious hacks which disrupt the system will be unlikely enough so as to occur less than once in 13.6 billion years, approximately the age of the universe, according to the researchers.

The classic concern is that a bad actor might try to spend the same bitcoin twice by altering the ledger to remove evidence of earlier transactions.

Professor Rachid Guerraoui, who co-authored the paper, explained this alternative approach to Innovation Toronto:

“If a malicious player wants to make a payment, for example, this system would not allow anyone to accept money from that player until a randomly chosen sample has confirmed the player has not sent money to anyone else; otherwise, the payment will not be accepted,” he explains. “Basically, we’re saying that you only need to exchange information with a sample of players to implement a cryptocurrency.”

Embedded in this is an “innocent-until-proven-guilty” assumption: users are trusted unless the transactions they’re attempting contradict the random sample of information that’s spread through the group. As soon as any malicious behavior is detected from a user, the rest are instructed to ignore any information that originated with that user.

Scaling Up the Rumor-Mill

The work has been well-received, obtaining best paper award from the International Symposium on Distributed Computing, one of the prominent conferences in the field. Highly theoretical, the paper is filled with mathematical proofs that detail how the system will work. This gives hope that the team may have cracked the Byzantine General’s problem in a way that doesn’t require costly number-crunching or consensus, but the approach will need to be thoroughly tested and implemented to ensure that it does work in practice.

Talking to IEEE Spectrum, Guerraoui said, “We now have major sponsorship from the EU to try and implement this on a large scale. We want to make it open source for anyone to download and use [so they can see for themselves] that it is robust.”

Time will also tell if the new system is adopted widely. Bitcoin has received attention principally for its fluctuating price and the speculative bubble surrounding cryptocurrencies; few practical transactions are carried out today using Bitcoin. Yet it has its defenders—many of whom are highly invested in its continued use and value—and new technologies may well be drowned out in the mix, even when they are arguably superior. For all the hype, Bitcoin can still only process a tiny fraction of the transactions that Visa does per second.

Solving the energy consumption and scaling problems will be crucial if Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter, is ever to fulfill its dream of replacing existing payment methods. There are currently only 300,000 Bitcoin transactions a day, compared to 150 million processed by Visa. But each Bitcoin transaction currently accounts for 213 megawatt hours of electricity consumption.

If this continued to scale, then Bitcoin would use more electricity than the entire world does today if it replaced Visa, with all the environmental and energy availability impacts this would entail. Defenders of Bitcoin would argue that it is growing more efficient over time, and could be powered renewably. But if Professor Guerraoui is correct that transactions under the new system would consume as much energy as sending an email, then it will be hard for the laborious, proof-of-work-based blockchain to compete.

We can’t afford to embed any more inefficient technologies in our global system. The blockchain may yet be a transformative force for good—but it needs to get smarter.

Making money, spending money, holding money, or just generally being around money, comes with a significant side effect, namely – taxes. The term itself evokes a desire to procrastinate, imagining hours and days of manual calculations and headache. Especially for newbies, it may seem like a gigantic bite to take. Like that's not enough, even professionals have trouble doing taxes for themselves and their clients when it comes to crypto, particularly due to lack of regulations.

So should you do your taxes? Well, yes. First of all, it’s the law to pay them and not following that law may get you in trouble. But secondly, you also want to know exactly, to the last sat, where you stand with your finances at any point in time – your gains, and your losses. You want to know how much you spend, where, how much you get, from whom, and how much money in fiat should you have ready for the tax time. And it’s far better to do this on a constant basis, than two days before you need it.

Luckily, the times are changing, and this change is the best seen by those connected to digital assets. With the general transfer of numerous businesses to the digital world, new tools are being created to accommodate the individual’s and business’s every need, and make the job at hand easier, in this case producing a tax report. Hence, a professional route is probably the best way to go, given that they will be familiarized with the tax law of your specific country/city. Additionally, contemporary tools and platforms are not only tax software, but portfolio trackers too, as they need the info to produce your report. They will help you import your data, calculate your taxes, and prepare your filing for you, delivering a full set of necessary documents. Additionally, you can often pay for a plan in crypto without giving out your real name anywhere in the signing-up process, which helps protect your identity and privacy.

Let us and your fellow readers know in the comments.",,https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/27/china-roundup-oct-26-2019/,"Welcome back to TechCrunch’s China roundup, a digest of the latest events that happened at major Chinese tech companies and what they mean to tech founders and executives around the world.

Alibaba’s nemesis

Alibaba’s new rival is shaking up China’s internet landscape.

This week, four-year-old e-commerce upstart Pinduoduo displaced JD.com to be the fourth-most valuable internet company in the country. Its market capitalization of $47.6 billion on Friday put it just behind e-commerce leader Alibaba, social networking behemoth Tencent and food delivery titan Meituan in China. Baidu, the search equivalent of Google in China, has fallen off the top-three club, ending a decade of unshakable dominance of Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (the “BAT”) on the Chinese internet.

The story of Pinduoduo comes down to growing internet penetration and the rise of social commerce. Pinduoduo, which is known for selling ultra-cheap products, is particularly popular with price-sensitive residents in small towns and rural regions, a market relatively underserved by online retail pioneers Alibaba and JD.com . However, Pinduoduo has set about targeting more urban consumers by heavily subsidizing big-ticket items such as iPhones.

Its seamless integration with WeChat, the ubiquitous messaging app owned by Pinduoduo investor Tencent, contributes to adaptability among a less tech-savvy population. WeChat users can access Pinduoduo via the messenger’s built-in lite app, skipping app downloads; they also get deals from group-buying, thus the name Pinduoduo, which means “shop more together” in Chinese.

Earlier this month, Pinduoduo founder and chief executive Colin Huang, a 39-year-old former Google engineer of few words, gave a 45-minute speech at the company’s anniversary, according to a summary published by local tech media Late News. He announced that Pinduoduo has surpassed JD.com in gross merchandise volume, or the total dollar value of goods sold. It’s unclear whether the companies use the same set of metrics for GMV, for instance, whether the figure includes refunded items.

While its rivalry with JD.com is nuanced as both companies are backed by Tencent, Pinduoduo’s competition against Alibaba is more blatant. In his missive to staff, Huang acknowledged that Pinduoduo is “standing on a giant’s shoulders,” hinting at Alibaba’s sheer size. When it comes to fighting the impending battle during the upcoming Single’s Day shopping festival (11/11), the founder sounded poised. “Pinduoduo should not feel pressured. The one who should is our peer.”

82% of Chinese adults used digital payments in 2018, up about 5%; among those living in rural China, 72% made transactions via online banking, telephone banking, the point-of-sale system, ATM or other digital channels, said a new report released by the People’s Bank of China. Beijing’s push for rural areas to go cash-free is in part what gives rise to such flourishing e-commerce businesses as Pinduoduo.

Few things move the bitcoin market like President Xi Jinping’s endorsement of blockchain. Speaking at a politburo meeting on Thursday, Xi called for China to “take blockchain as an important breakthrough to achieve independence of core technologies” (in Chinese). Bitcoin price soared more than 10% in response. But as industry experts cautioned, when China, where crypto exchanges are banned, speaks of “blockchain” it usually means the encrypted technology that not only undergirds cryptocurrencies but can revolutionize a whole range of sectors like finance, manufacturing and agriculture. Expect all corners of Chinese society to capitalize on the blockchain concept with even greater force.",2019-10-27,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-capital-principal-indicted-on-fraud-confirming-bitfinex-allegations,"Crypto Capital principal Oz Yosef was indicted on three criminal counts by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York Wednesday, Oct. 23, confirming statements made by Bitfinex’s general counsel Stuart Hoegner Friday.

According to court documents, Yosef, aka Oz Joseph, has been indicted on conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.

In an overt act cited by court documents, Yosef sent a text to an unnamed source “regarding the need to transfer $10,000,000 to a bank located in the Bahamas, knowing that the funds would be transferred from a bank account maintained with a bank located in Manhattan, New York.”

Following criminal investigations by multiple international bodies, including U.S. authorities, this past Spring, Crypto Capital’s funds were frozen. Of the funds seized from the banking solution platform, $880 million belonged to crypto exchange Bitfinex which maintained a relationship with the company. The lost funds triggered an investigation by the New York Attorney’s Office into the relationship between Bitfinex and sister firm Tether.

On Thursday, Crypto Capital president Ivan Manuel Molina Lee was extradited to Poland by Polish authorities on charges of money laundering. Lee is charged with laundering 1.5 billion zloty, or about $390 million.

Upon Lee’s arrest, Hoegner released a statement on behalf of the exchange which claimed Bitfinex to be the victim of fraud. Hoegner stated Yosef had been indicted by the Southern District of New York, although court documents had not yet been released to support that.

As a result of the indictment, Yosef will forfeit listed assets “representing the number of proceeds traceable to the commission of said offenses.”

Court documents name a list of specific assets including those of Crypto Capital principal Reginal Fowler, charged with running a shadow banking service by the U.S. Attorney’s Office this past Spring and Global Trade Solutions LLC, the parent firm of Crypto Capital. Eligibility Criterion, Eurocontrol, and Spiral Global Development are also listed by the court.

Bitcoin's price rose sharply over the weekend, recovering from a plunge just days earlier, after Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech embracing blockchain technology and calling on his country to advance development in the field. The value of the world's best-known cryptocurrency jumped as high as $10,332 on Saturday, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. The price has since eased to around $9,370 as of Monday morning, up about 1% on the day. The virtual currency's jump came as China's leader sang the praises of blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. According to state media, Xi said Friday that China has a strong foundation and should look to take a leading position in the sector.

He reportedly said China should ""seize the opportunity"" offered by blockchain, adding the technology could benefit a range of industries including finance, education and health care. A blockchain is a digital ledger that maintains a record of transactions or other data across a network of computers. Beijing has taken a tough stance on cryptocurrencies, banning a fundraising exercise known as an initial coin offering and forcing local trading platforms to shut down in 2017. China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has been working on its own digital currency. It has accelerated its development in recent months as Facebook and a handful of other companies look to shake up the global financial services industry with a cryptocurrency called libra. The PBOC set up a research team back in 2014 to explore the use of virtual currencies to reduce the costs involved in circulating traditional paper-based money. A senior official at the bank said last month that the planned digital token would bear some similarities to libra. Libra has come under intense scrutiny from regulators around the world, who worry Facebook's proposed digital asset would disrupt the financial system and could be open to risks like money laundering and terrorist financing. Lawmakers last week grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the project. Zuckerberg at one point said the social network would not take part in launching libra ""until U.S. regulators approve.""",2019-10-28,https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/chinese-btc-rally-national-coins-wont-be-gateways-to-crypto/,"This past Friday, Chinese Presiden Xi Jinping came out in support of blockchain technology during a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist party’s Central Committee. Specifically, Jinping called for his country to adopt blockchain technology “as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies.”

Local news media source Xinhua Net said that Xi specifically called for the adoption of blockchain technology in “digital finance, Internet of Things, intelligent manufacturing, supply chain management, digital asset trading, and other fields.” (Translated quote.)

He also said that China would be investing in the development of blockchain technology.

So, when Bitcoin began to rally over the weekend–briefly peaking over $10,000–a number of analysts were quick to connect the dots: after all, the Chinese president’s support of blockchain is certainly a good sign for Bitcoin, right?

Perhaps–but, as a data scientist and creator of UsefulTulips.com Matt Ahlborg said several weeks ago regarding connections between Hong Kong protests and a BTC price bump, “be mindful of narrative pushers on every side of Bitcoin, including myself.”

[5/6] So there you have it. As most people with a brain know, a single week of volume from a single source isn’t enough to conclude anything. Be mindful of narrative pushers on every side of Bitcoin, including myself… — Matt Ahlborg [UsefulTulips.org] (@MattAhlborg) October 4, 2019

Indeed, saying that Xi Jinping’s comments on blockchain were the cause of Bitcoin’s rise is certainly an easy connection to make–but what are the facts?

Here’s what we know: a look at the data

There certainly does seem to be a strong correlation between the timing of the reporting on Xi’s comments and Bitcoin’s upward journey.

Indeed, when reports of Xi’s speech hit the web at 06:14 AM EST, the price of Bitcoin began to move up within several minutes. Within the first hour that the news was live, BTC rose from roughly $7500 to $7600. Within six hours, the price had spiked to $8400; just after the clock struck 1:00 PM in New York City, BTC had reached $8800.

Additionally, well-known industry analyst and Primitive Crypto founder Dovey Wan tweeted that on search engine Baidu, “where most newbies actively search for stuff they come to know for the first time,” there was a massive spike in the search terms “Blockchain” and “Bitcoin” following Xi’s speech.

Specifically, Wan said that there was a “whopping over 1300% increase in Blockchain search on 25th, surpass[ing] Bitcoin.”

Wan also pointed out rises in the search terms “blockchain” and “Bitcoin” on WeChat’s search index following the news, noting that “Bitcoin query also dipped/stayed flat on 25th as Wechat, and jumped back up on 26th.”

2/ Wechat, where most industry ppl came to know abt it the first hand (most of white-collar usually don’t watch CCP news) see a significant spike in Blockchain right on 25th, Bitcoin dipped a little (-5%); Bitcoin spiked on 26th, which I suspect a lagging indicator to the price pic.twitter.com/fMtHjdntBx — Dovey 以德服人 Wan 🗝 🦖 (@DoveyWan) October 27, 2019

Do investors know the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain…?

However, as analyst Kyle Torpey wrote in a piece for LongHash that “the connection between Xi’s remarks and the Bitcoin price is somewhat unclear, as the president’s comments don’t have much to do with Bitcoin’s key value proposition as an apolitical, uncontrollable digital money.”

In other words, the fact that Xi is a fan of blockchain is great–but it really doesn’t have anything to do with Bitcoin. In fact, China’s official policy has been famously anti-crypto since the fourth quarter of 2017, when the country instituted a sweeping set of bans that outlawed ICOs, banned domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, and blocked internet access to cryptocurrency exchanges.

Therefore, Torpey pointed out that if Xi’s remarks did indeed cause the spike, that investors may not really know the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain.

President Xi’s comments on blockchain were followed by an 18% jump in Bitcoin’s price. China supports blockchain tech, but doesn’t particularly like Bitcoin. The price jump suggests investors don’t see difference between the two https://t.co/sF1DJ2pBse Analysis by @kyletorpey — LongHash (@longhashdata) October 25, 2019

Indeed, even though “China continues to go down the road of ‘blockchain not Bitcoin’…the price jump shows [that] investors don’t seem able to differentiate between the two,” Torpey wrote.

David Hsiao, CEO of Block Journal, also tweeted that “Xi Jinping says China will put focus on blockchain development. Remember: Keyword [is] ‘blockchain,’ not Bitcoin. Big difference.”

“It’s pretty funny that Bitcoin is up on Xi Jinping saying nice things about blockchain.”

Seeming to come to a similar conclusion regarding the apparent confusion between Bitcoin and blockchain, Gady Epstein, The Economist’s China Affairs Editor, tweeted that “it’s pretty funny that Bitcoin is up on Xi Jinping saying nice things about blockchain.”

And indeed, even though China is currently working on producing a national cryptocurrency of its own, this is not a positive sign for Bitcoin or for the cryptocurrency industry: “this will only increase government’s control of our money. Now it will be easier for them to tax you or track where you move your money, not to mention them keeping their ability to ‘print money,’” said Canadian anarcho-capitalist and entrepreneur Jeff Berwick in an interview with Finance Magnates conducted earlier this year.

If anything, Bitcoin stands in direct opposition to what China may be trying to accomplish with its adoption of blockchain technology: “Bitcoin has changed quite a bit over the last few years and it’s been regulated,” Berwick said. “However, it still is a currency totally outside of the control of central banks or governments. That truly is a libertarian dream.”

Chinese blockchain companies see massive increases in stock prices

However, the fact that practically each and every China-based blockchain firm saw a rise in its stock value following Xi’s speech seems to indicate that there are at least some investors who do seem to know the difference.

“Chinese investors snapped up every blockchain-related stock in sight after President Xi Jinping said Beijing wants to speed up development of the technology,” says a report from Bloomberg published on October 28th.

“The market reaction shows how far an endorsement from Xi can go in China, where high-level officials on Monday began their first major policy meeting since early 2018,” the piece said, also pointing to the fact that “[the] Shenzhen tech index surge[d] 5.3%, the most in eight months.”

cnLedger, a popular Twitter account that shares news about the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry in China, also reported that “Xunlei, a company selling cloud downloading services and claimed heavily invested in blockchain, just doubled its stock marketcap over the night. (sic)”

It’s difficult to “isolate” Bitcoin from blockchain…perhaps especially in China

Additionally, Dovey Wan pointed out that it’s difficult to isolate Bitcoin from the rest of the blockchain industry: “the Blockchain shill from Xi definitely helps Bitcoin awareness as well, the two concepts are interrelated, hard to isolate one from each other,” she wrote on Twitter.

In her opinion, “we can also see that the news didn’t pump Bitcoin instantly (both materially and mentally) on 25th, it’s more as a aftermath. (sic)”

Indeed, “this Xi Shill is definitely bullish for the whole industry, especially as the highest level of recognition from CCP, when previously “blockchain/bitcoin is a scam” is the leading narrative among average Chinese ppl,” she wrote, adding that “’China FUD’ in the west can also shut up to some extent,” referring to western holders’ tendency to blame bad news in China for fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price.

Wan also pointed out that the “China Merchant Bank just announced invested in BitPie, the Bitcoin wallet with [the] longest history and most users back in China.”

“All I can say is this to me it’s a sign of beginning of the nationalization of Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency related infra in mainland, (sic)” she wrote. “Eventually, all things can be state-owned, or at least partially (mining, ASIC, exchanges, wallets, etc etc).”

And the Chinese government has made some nods toward Bitcoin bullishness in the past. Earlier this year, Samson Mow, CEO of Pixelmatic, pointed out on Twitter that the Bank of China posted an educational piece on Bitcoin.

Yesterday the #BankofChina posted up an article about #Bitcoin. They explained how $BTC works, why the price is going up, and why it’s valuable. Never thought I’d see that happen. 😅 #Bullish pic.twitter.com/GKzj7XJjJa — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 27, 2019

A sign of market maturity?

Bitcoin’s reaction to Jinping’s remarks could also be evidence that Bitcoin is becoming further integrated into the cryptocurrency market as a whole.

In a recent interview with Finance Magnates, Zak Selbert, CEO and co-founder of analytics firm Indexica, said that Bitcoin’s price movements are the result of an increasingly dynamic range of factors, including the movements of other currencies, partnerships within the industry, and the way that blockchain and bitcoin are spoken about on the internet.

Other things that could be influencing the price of Bitcoin include “sentiment for Mastercard, futurity for gold, volume for ETFs, and buzz sentiment for blockchain.”

Selbert explained that “this really implies–if you look at the entity [itself]–that Bitcoin is part of a much larger ecosystem, and what moves it could be anything that happens in that ecosystem.”",2019-10-28 10:49:48+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-chart-now-looks-ridiculous-after-record-gains-analyst,"Bitcoin (BTC) held above $9,000 on Oct. 28 as a weekend of bullish madness continued to captivate markets.

Bitcoin price mulls next move amid $8.8K warning

Data from Coin360 showed volatility remaining elevated for Bitcoin on Monday, with swings between $9,100 and $9,900 characterizing the past 24 hours.

On Friday, news that China was officially embracing blockchain technology appeared to reawaken enthusiasm across cryptocurrency markets. After trailing at $7,400 for several days, BTC/USD suddenly exploded, hitting local highs of nearly $10,500 early Saturday morning.

Those levels have since consolidated, with the press time price of $9,400 nonetheless corresponding to 3-day gains of 25%.

China fuelled the mood once more as the week began, Cointelegraph reporting on the news a major national bank had sealed an investment deal in a Bitcoin wallet provider.

Despite the excitement being tangible among market participants, however, not everyone was convinced the new highs would endure.

“The chart obviously looks completely ridiculous now and CME are going to open with a gap to the upside if prices remain like this,” Cointelegraph contributor filbfilb told subscribers of his dedicated Telegram channel over the weekend.

Filbfilb added he expected BTC/USD to return to levels around $8,800.

Altcoin markets show a clear divide

Altcoins likewise maintained higher levels after rising precipitously in line with Bitcoin. However, it was Chinese projects which showed a clear advantage for traders.

Both Tron (TRX) and NEO (NEO) delivered considerably stronger performances than the average top twenty cryptocurrency, both rising around 23% in the past 24 hours. Tezos (XTZ) and Zcash (ZEC) also showed progress with 8% gains.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, meanwhile saw sideways movements on Monday, with daily gains of just 1.5% to $182.

In roughly 17 days, the Bitcoin Cash network will upgrade by adding two new features to the protocol. Meanwhile, prior to the forthcoming changes, a large percentage of the BCH hashrate is being processed by unknown miners. Crypto proponents have been very focused on the hashrate and BCH pool distribution as speculators believe a few stealth miners have been gaming the difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA).

Theories of Unknown Miners and Gaming the DAA

Every six months the BCH chain upgrades in order to continue scaling the network. On November 15, the BCH network will see two new features added that aim to bolster the Bitcoin Cash roadmap. Engineers have disclosed that the upgrade will finalize the BIP62 malleability vector by enforcing Minimaldata in script and it will also implement Schnorr support for OP_Checkmultisig. While node operators upgrade their full nodes and participants prepare for the upcoming changes, there’s been some oddities taking place with the BCH hashrate. On October 25, observers noticed unknown miners had captured a lot of blocks in a two-day span. One particular block had a three-hour gap and speculators started assuming that large BTC or BSV miners had been gaming the difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA). One theory says that large pools have been jumping back and forth from one network to another, moving large percentages of hashpower periodically. The assumption is that some nefarious pools have been trying to push ideological BCH miners out of the equation.

However, some individuals believe the three-hour gap was perfectly normal as the 14% change in difficulty at that point in time was quite massive. One person wrote a blog post explaining why they thought the BCH attack theories have been significantly hyped. “There is nothing in the current data that even remotely resembles a 50% attack — The hashrate rose barely by 10%,” the author wrote. “The 3-hour gap was most likely caused by a large (around 10% of the total hashrate) miner leaving the network — In the period after that we had 149 blocks in 22 hours, which works out to 6.7 per hour with a target of 6,” the blog post highlighted. The individual added:

This is pretty normal, a change in the difficulty of this magnitude is bound to cause oscillations of over and under adjustments. As I’m writing this, the hashrate is rising again by about 10%, this can easily be explained by people switching on their miners in response to those events.

The Halvening Effect

In fact, looking at the data site Fork.lol shows there wasn’t that much variance over the last week, despite the significant difficulty change which caused the lengthy three-hour interval. The BCH hashrate has been between 2-3 exahash per second (EH/s) and BTC’s hashrate has been between 80-105 EH/s. The daily BCH hashrate by mining pool has been increasing slightly since the first week of October. It is also between 1-4% more profitable to mine on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain at the time of writing.

Coin Dance statistics also show that the unknown miners have captured 49% over the course of seven days and 44% for today’s hashrate distribution data. There are those that believe the stealth miners could be about 2-4 pools because there are different coinbase addresses used for blocks found by unknown miners. Others have speculated that the miners are proponents of BCH and are merely stockpiling coins before the halvening. “I think they might be stacking BCH before the halvening,” a user on the Reddit forum r/btc opined.

“I think this is a sign of the approaching halvening — We will likely see more miners experimenting and playing with their otherwise useless BTC hashpower by pointing it at BCH,” redditor ‘Bitmeister’ remarked. “Succinctly, any shift in hashpower from BTC to BCH will look like this initially, whether the motivation is good or evil.”

At press time, there have been no oddities associated with the intervals of time in between blocks found on the BCH chain. Despite a large amount of hashrate being consumed by stealth miners and the price changes making BCH more profitable at times, the stories seem blown out of proportion. The influx of unknown miners has been taking place since mid-2018 and these pools can be seen on both networks. A touch above 20% of the BTC hashrate is also processed by stealth miners. With the upgrade advancing, people could be on edge and trolls are quick to cause fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) whenever there’s an opportunity.

On Oct. 16, Cointelegraph reported on how authorities in the United States successfully shut down an international child pornography site. To identify the criminals, the investigators used tools developed by analytic company Chainalysis, which helped to track the Bitcoin (BTC) wallets, used by the criminals to receive payments from customers.

As authorities find more and more ways to track cryptocurrencies, criminals use new techniques, and many sites remain beyond government control. Who will win this battle and can the fight against financial crimes grow into total control over users?

Cryptocurrencies are not anonymous

Before cryptocurrencies gained worldwide popularity, they attracted the attention of criminals who accepted Bitcoin payments in exchnage for drugs and weapons, while others used it to financing terrorism and launder money. As a result, for some time, most had been under the impression that cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous.

In reality, digital currency is far from anonymous. Every transaction carried out in a decentralized network is forever recorded on a public blockchain. Indeed, in order to become the owner of a crypto wallet, users are required to provide personal data.

This is where anonymity ends, though. Any movement of the cryptocurrency — whether it is payment for goods or services, exchange or transfer — becomes visible to all users, and the history of these transactions is tied to each coin, even if it changes its owner later.

According to cybersecurity firm Ciphertrace, its software can track 87% of the global cryptocurrency transaction volume, which may mean that authorities can use monitoring methods not only against criminals but also against ordinary people.

Largest illegal cryptocurrency transactions detected

Cryptocurrencies’ anonymity and their use for criminal purposes no longer seems to be a difficult task for law enforcement agencies. The largest operations to dismantle criminal structures and the confiscation of illegally obtained cryptocurrencies are indicative in this regard. One particular report for 2013–2018 shows, for instance, that global authorities have confiscated over 453,000 BTC, with the U.S. alone accounting for 200,000 BTC.

Sale of illegal goods

The leader in facilitating illegal cryptocurrency transactions is the infamous darknet, a shadow marketplace where hundreds of thousands of illegal goods are sold, including drugs, weapons and crypto malware.

The first such marketplace called Silk Road was liquidated in July 2013. The FBI initially managed to seize about 26,000 BTC, but by the end of that October, the figure had reached 144,000 BTC. As of today, this amount is equivalent of about $5 billion. Four years later, in July 2017, the FBI detected and shut down the AlphaBay platform, confiscating 1,605 BTC, 8,309 Ethereum (ETH), 3,692 ZCash and some Monero (XMR).

Shortly after the AlphaBay arrest, the owners of another marketplace — Hansa Market — were apprehended by U.S. authorities and the platform was shut down. During the operation, the police confiscated more than 1,200 BTC and transferred data about the buyers and sellers to authorities throughout Europe.

Theft and money laundering

In February 2019, U.S. law enforcement agencies not only detected and confiscated but also returned 119,756 BTC (about $65 million at the time) to the Bitfinex exchange, which had been hacked in 2016.

Notably, the FBI demonstrated the highest efficiency in terms of the number of cryptocurrency crimes investigations. During one of them, the founder of the Bitcoin Savings and Trust exchange was identified and accused of organizing a Ponzi scheme in 2016. The fraudster earned more than 720,000 BTC by illegally selling securities. Later, in 2017, investigators dismantled the Coin.mx crypto exchange, the owners of which managed to illegally exchange more than $10 million in cryptocurrency.

The biggest crime that has been investigated by tracking cryptocurrency transactions is probably the laundering of 530,000 BTC stolen from the Mt. Gox exchange. For more than three years, U.S. authorities, together with a group of independent Bitcoin security experts called WizSec, carried out an investigation, which resulted in the case against Alexander Vinnik in 2016.

Related: BTC-e’s Vinnik Case Drags on as New Accusations Continue Emerging

Vinnik allegedly used various exchanges to sell Bitcoins, thus leaving a lot of tracks that supported the case against him. Therefore, as soon as the police discovered where the Bitcoins stolen from Mt. Gox were deposited to, the investigators said that it became much easier to link Vinnik to the case — and over time, experts were able to piece together a timeline of events. However, the question still remains, who were the people behind the attack?

How they track

In most cases, authorities use traditional methods for tracking cryptocurrency transactions that are no different from those used to monitor any other suspicious financial operations. This is the identification of the user through the data obtained during Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, the mapping of IP servers, withdrawal data comparison, and other methods.

Therefore, crypto exchanges and platforms that have user data of cryptocurrency holders play an important role in the timely detection of suspicious transactions. In fact, it was a cryptocurrency exchanges that helped the Japanese national police agency disclose data on 5,944 suspicious crypto transactions in 2018.

On Aug. 30 this year, the agency announced its plans to introduce a system that can track cryptocurrency transactions in the country. The system is supposed to detect suspicious transactions by comparing them, and then accurately determine the source and destination of illegal money. In China, according to reports released in March, the Public Information Network Security Supervision has been monitoring foreign crypto exchanges that serve Chinese citizens.

Meanwhile in the U.S., authorities have been working with exchanges for several years now. In particular, in November 2016, the police demanded that Coinbase provide the Internal Revenue Service with information about users who have cryptocurrency wallets.

Bitcoin Big Bang

Recently, innovative solutions have appeared that can track suspicious cryptocurrency transactions and identify their initiators using decryption algorithms, software and blockchain.

For example, the company Elliptic Enterprises has created an algorithm for recognizing illegal Bitcoin payments. The software detects suspicious transactions based on patterns previously used by financial criminals. At the same time, according to the developers, the solution is able to correlate digital identities with real-world profiles.

In particular, the company developed the Bitcoin Big Bang visualization map that summarizes all BTC payments over the past six years, which allows for the rapid detection of suspicious transaction chains and organizations involved in them.

Suspicious transactions alert

Chainalysis, a blockchain analytic firm, has developed a real-time alert system called Chainalysis KYT, which informs users about suspicious transactions. According to the developers, the solution is primarily designed for cryptocurrency companies and financial institutions and allows them to reduce regulatory and reputation risks.

Chainalysis KYT analyzes 15 cryptocurrencies and is used by large exchanges. In particular, on Sept. 26, Bittrex announced the introduction of the Chainalysis KYT solution to track suspicious transactions and other activity on the platform. The forensic investigation tools created by the Chainalysis developers also helped to reveal the owners of What to Video, a website that earned about $353,000 in BTC by selling child pornography videos. In total, 1.3 million BTC addresses were involved.

Having found that some users of the site paid for pornographic videos using their crypto exchange accounts, Chainalysis used a tool called Chanalysis Reactor to analyze cryptocurrency transactions. As a result, the investigators identified certain BTC addresses for which it later requested data from the exchanges.

Deanonymization and KYC

The South Korean government has totally banned anonymous trading at the start of 2018. A system of real names has been introduced in the country, with all the traders obliged to have an account with a local bank, and trading platforms prohibited from listing anonymous cryptocurrencies.

Meanwhile, private companies are already declaring that most of the cryptocurrencies are controlled. In particular, on Oct. 15, CipherTrace announced that it can now track more than 87% of the transaction volume. However, anonymous coins such as Monero are not supported at present.

Related: Privacy-Focused Cryptos Hunted Down by Forensics and Exchanges

As such, the CipherTrace Financial Investigations is another solution that can deanonymize players in the crypto market and track criminal transactions, including darknet payments, initial coin offering investments, stolen funds and so on.

According to the company’s website, the platform only needs the user to enter a cryptocurrency address or a transaction ID into the search bar, which auto-completes long addresses, for the system to start working. In the case that illegal actions are detected as related to an address, the system will then automatically identify all other relevant transactions.

In the U.S., the IRS, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs, and other organizations currently use solutions by CipherTrace, Chainalysis and Elliptic.

Well-known mining equipment manufacturer Bitfury has developed a solution called Crystal for blockchain investigations. According to the creators, Crystal not only helps to identify wallet addresses but also connects them with real-world profiles.

Crystal helped the police conduct a thorough investigation of the movement of funds withdrawn from the Zaif exchange during its hack in September 2018. As a result, specialists were able to track that a fourth of the stolen Bitcoins was sent to the Binance exchange in a series of small transactions, and then passed through a mixer to cover the tracks.

Workarounds

Regulators are releasing more and more requirements, obliging banks and operators that carry out cryptocurrency transactions to comply with KYC and AML procedures. Notably, some exchanges ask their users only for a passport, while others request additional documents — for example, a utility bill or a driver’s license. Given that a third-party’s passport and documents are easy to find on the internet, this procedure can be bypassed in some cases.

Related: Cryptocurrency Mixers and Why Governments May Want to Shut Them Down

Another problem that authorities may encounter when trying to track cryptocurrency payments are mixer platforms, which compile crypto transactions of equal value when processing them, thus covering up the tracks. As a result, users receive the same amount of crypto, minus the commission, but in different Bitcoins.

Are cryptocurrencies as dangerous as authorities believe?

Using unregulated websites entails a high risk for criminals, and the liquidity of such services is not always sufficient for laundering large amounts of money. While exchange of $1 million can go unnoticed on Binance, selling the same amount on a small exchange may take days.

No matter how many ways there are to launder money through cryptocurrencies, this is not the most popular tool for a fraudster today. According to Chainalysis, illegal cryptocurrency transactions comprised less than 1% of all Bitcoin activity in 2018, down from 7% in 2012.

Cryptocurrencies have got a long way to go before they become an attractive way to launder money. In particular, the market must grow, and alternative instruments — such as anonymous cryptocurrencies — must reach big trading volumes and liquidity. And yet, according to the analytics platform Diar, $5.7 million was spent on analyzing cryptocurrency transactions in the U.S. alone.

The community is concerned that Bitcoin’s pseudonymity may be used by authorities to tighten control over the personal lives of ordinary citizens. In April 2019, Chainalysis called on the Financial Action Task Force to refrain from excessive tightening of the cryptocurrency industry regulation, as the measures proposed by the organization could lead to the massive closure of exchanges and other infrastructure services, forcing criminals to find new ways to circumvent laws.

Ordinary citizens cannot avoid being affected by the stricter government control, according to Matthew Green, one of the key developers of the Zcash network. It was also reported that the U.S. National Security Agency is developing the “Oakstar” system, which analyzes several cryptocurrencies. The program can allegedly associate particular people with their cryptocurrency wallets, since users download software that sends their internet data.

According to Arnold Spencer, general counsel for Bitcoin ATM producer Coinsource and the former assistant U.S. attorney in Texas, who prosecuted more than 100 federal cases, there is a hypothetical scenario in which compliance becomes such a burden that digital money is no longer convenient. However, in reality, the possible benefits outweigh the negatives. He explained to Cointelegraph:

“Digital currency compliance is convenient for customers. Many BTMs can process Bitcoin transactions for new customers in minutes. [...] On exchanges, it may be inconvenient to register and clear compliance when you first sign up, but individuals can buy or sell or transact with digital money from their home computer in a few clicks. Much more convenient (and less expensive) than using dollar bills or credit cards.”

Spencer added that the issue of cryptocurrency transaction tracking is a debate surrounding the balance between personal privacy and public safety:

“That debate is perpetual. But the technology surrounding compliance is getting better every week, and compliance is becoming more and more convenient. My view is that we are heading in the right direction — we need a modicum of compliance to protect ourselves, but getting that level is getting easier and easier.”

Moreover, according to him, a well-developed regulatory framework would play an important role in helping governments detect criminals and protecting ordinary citizens from illegal actions, saying, “In an age in which businesses collect, analyze and sell our private information, it makes enormous sense to have legislation which protects the privacy of our financial transactions.“",,https://news.bitcoin.com/after-breaking-new-records-bakkt-announces-crypto-consumer-app/,"After Breaking New Records Bakkt Announces Crypto Consumer App

Bakkt Announces a Crypto Consumer App After Its Futures Volume Broke Records

Bakkt’s physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts have been steadily gaining interest as the market has seen a few new records since launching. On October 11, Bakkt revealed it had conducted its first block trade while also seeing a 796% jump in futures trade volume in a one intra-day trading session. A little more than a week later, Bakkt contracts reached another milestone with 640 BTC swapped on October 23.

Both times, the rise in futures interest on Bakkt followed the enormous price drops BTC felt in the last few weeks. Then, after BTC and the rest of the cryptoconomy jumped 20% higher or more the following day, Bakkt again broke records. This time Bakkt volumes saw 1,179 contracts on October 25 and volumes that followed have been much stronger. After Bakkt’s new record, Mike Blandina, Bakkt’s chief product officer, told the public about a new consumer application the firm is releasing in 2020.

“We’ll be launching a consumer app to make it easy for consumers to discover and unlock the value of digital assets, as well as ways in which they can transact or track them. Merchants gain access to a broader set of customers with expanded spending power,” Blandina’s blog post announcement details.

Bakkt’s New App Focuses on Four Key Areas: Infrastructure, Accessibility, Trust, and Ultimate Control for the User

Blandina said that Bakkt wants to strengthen four key areas within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frictionless digital asset infrastructure, marketplace accessibility, a trustworthy brand, and a noncustodial solution “with the concept of a consumer-driven platform that offers the ultimate control over their digital assets.”

∙ Today's volume so far: 376 BTC

∙ Last traded price: $9,487.50

∙ Trading day progress: 39%

∙ If this continues, 100% would equal to: 965 BTC — Bakkt Volume Bot (@BakktBot) October 28, 2019

Derivatives markets in the crypto space are not the only part of the industry Bakkt wants to tackle, and by 2020 the company hopes to launch the new cryptocurrency-centric consumer app. “Over the last year, we’ve assembled a strong team of payments engineers and are nearing completion of our core payments and compliance platform,” Blandina stressed. Bakkt’s chief product officer added:

We’re now focused on the development of the consumer app and merchant portal, as well as testing with our first launch partner, Starbucks, which we expect in the first half of next year.

The news follows Fidelity Investment’s recent announcement when reporters from the Financial Times (FT) disclosed that “Fidelity has rolled out its cryptocurrency custody business.” The firm’s cryptocurrency unit was revealed in 2018 and according to FT: “[Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS)] is now engaged in a full rollout of its custody and trading services for digital assets.” Bakkt executive Blandina underlined that the “core tenet” of Bakkt’s strategy was similar by “unlocking the value of digital assets” through consumer payments. Blandina concluded by explaining interested parties can sign up now for early access to the Bakkt consumer application.

On Oct. 28, Canaan Creative filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise $400 million, while planning to be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker CAN.

Canaan reportedly filed a $200 million IPO draft request with the U.S. regulators in July, but the formal F-1 form was not made public until today.

If successful, Canaan, which is one of the three major Chinese crypto mining companies alongside Bitmain and Yibang International, could become the first China-based mining firm to be publicly traded in the U.S.

Bitmain already filed to list an IPO with the U.S. SEC in June 2019, following the expiration of its IPO listing application with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in March.

According to the SEC filing, Canaan generated $394 million in revenue in 2018, with a net income of $8.3 million. However, the designer and manufacturer of Bitcoin mining machines has experienced a total comprehensive income loss of $45.8 million in 2019.

Canaan competitor opens the “world’s largest” mining farm

Canaan’s biggest competitor Bitmain opened what it claimed to be the world’s largest facility for Bitcoin (BTC) mining in Rockdale, Texas, which was completed thanks to a collaboration with the Rockdale Municipal Development District and Canadian technology firm DMG Blockchain Solutions.

Clinton Brown, Rockdale lead project manager for Bitmain, said that the facility’s launch is “significant to Bitmain's global expansion plans” and that the state’s stable and efficient energy resources will be fundamental to supporting what he believes is set to be the inevitable scale of growth of the mining industry.",,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-price-latest-change-prediction-china-cryptocurrency-market-analysis-a9174496.html,"The price of bitcoin has levelled off following wild market swings over the last few days, though experts predict more volatility for the cryptocurrency.

It is currently trading at around $9,300 (£7,200), having dropped below $7,500 last week amid questions over Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project and reports that quantum computers could pose a threat to bitcoin. This dip was shortly followed by a major price surge that saw bitcoin briefly reach above $10,000 over the weekend.

Despite the price turmoil over the last week bitcoin has managed to avoid the so-called Death Cross – a market pattern that takes place when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.

Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Nigel Green, who is the chief executive of the deVere Group financial advisory firm, believes bitcoin will experience more gains and hit $12,000 before the end of the year – so long as it is able to stay above the key support level of $8,500 this week.

“Bitcoin has registered some impressive gains over the last 48 hours after being in a lull period in recent weeks,” Mr Green told The Independent. “The $8,500 support has previously acted as a crucial support for bitcoin. I believe that if bitcoin traders can keep the price above this over the next week, the world’s dominant cryptocurrency will experience a breakout.”

China has been on a roll with a series of crypto-related announcements. President Xi Jinping’s speech to accelerate the development of blockchain technology in China was followed by the passing of a cryptography bill. Meanwhile, China’s Center for Information and Industry Development has continued to evaluate and rank crypto projects, and the central bank is preparing to launch its own digital currency.

China’s Latest Rankings: 35 Projects

As China embraces blockchain technology and prepares to launch its own digital currency, the country’s Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) has continued to publish crypto project rankings. The CCID is a scientific research institute directly under China’s Ministry of Industry in Information Technology. The first ranking, published in May last year, took the crypto industry by surprise.

The latest set of rankings consists of 35 crypto projects, ranked based on the CCID’s Global Public Blockchain Technology Assessment Index. There are three sub-indices: basic technology, applicability, creativity. Collectively, they make up the overall ranking.

Occupying the number one spot overall is EOS, which has been at the top of the overall rankings since the center started evaluating it back in June last year. The second position has changed from the previous ranking, with TRON replacing Ethereum. NULS remains in the fourth position, while Bitcoin remains in the 11th spot. Bitcoin Cash now ranks 30th, down a few positions from the 26th spot previously.

The institute explained that the average value of the basic technology sub-index is mostly unchanged from the previous period. The average value of the creativity index has marginally increased, while the average value of the applicability index has increased substantially. Two projects, Gxchain and XEM, have been removed for further observation because “a dynamic adjustment mechanism was introduced to adjust the public chain whose code update rate is too low,” the CCID explained.

The indices are compiled by the CCID (Qingdao) blockchain research institute, an entity established by the CCID. The rankings and evaluation work are carried out every two months in collaboration with multiple parties such as the CCID think tank and the China Software Evaluation Center. “The result of this assessment will allow the CCID group to provide better technical consulting services for government agencies, business enterprises, research institutes, and technology developers,” the institute previously explained. The CCID provides professional services to the government including research, consulting, evaluation, certification, and research and development, its website describes.

China’s CBDC and Cryptography Law

While the CCID has been evaluating crypto projects for over a year, China’s central bank has been researching the possibility of issuing its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) for much longer. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set up a research team in 2014 to explore launching its own digital currency, reportedly to reduce the costs of circulating traditional paper money and boost policymakers’ control of money supply.

The project was recently accelerated following the announcement by social media giant Facebook regarding the Libra digital currency project. Having hinted to the media that its CBDC was “almost ready,” the PBOC later stated that more research was needed. Governor Yi Gang clarified earlier this month that there was no timeframe for the launch and more time is needed for further research, testing, trials, assessments, and risk prevention. Nonetheless, some people are more optimistic about the time frame. Huang Qifan, Vice Chairman of China Center for International Economic Exchanges, talked about the country’s digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system in his keynote speech at the Bund Summit, a financial conference in Shanghai, on Monday. He remarked:

The PBOC has been studying DCEP for five or six years, and is likely to be the first central bank in the world to launch a digital currency

While Chinese authorities have indicated that its digital currency would be similar to Libra, some experts have reservations about the DCEP system. Zhang Anyuan, chief economist from China Securities, was quoted by The South China Morning Post as saying: “DCEP anchoring purely on [the yuan] won’t be able to compete with Libra, despite it may draw the participation of internet giants like Alibaba and Tencent.” He elaborated that, based on the details revealed so far, “its internationalization will not succeed without a monetary theory breakthrough or a money creation innovation,” the publication conveyed.

Further, China’s official state-run press agency Xinhua News Agency reported late on Saturday that a cryptography law has been passed and will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020. This law is aimed at “facilitating the development of the cryptography business and ensuring the security of cyberspace and information,” the publication explained, citing parliament.

Xi Jinping Elevates Blockchain in China

Chinese President Xi Jinping, while still silencing protesters in Hong Kong, managed to gain immense popularity within the crypto community last week when he said that China should expedite the development of blockchain technology as the core for innovation.

He emphasized that the integrated application of blockchain technology plays an important role in new technological innovation and industrial transformation, Xinhua reported and quoted Xi as saying:

We must take blockchain as an important breakthrough for independent innovation of core technologies, clarify the main directions, increase investment, focus on a number of key technologies, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.

“Chinese president seldom elaborates on a particular tech,” commented Twitter handle Cnledger. “Previously, only [the] internet and artificial intelligence were specifically elaborated on and collectively studied in the Central Political Bureau. This means blockchain is at least raised to the same level as A.I. in China.” Following Xi’s statements, blockchain-related stocks spiked. Xunlei, a company selling cloud downloading services claiming to be heavily invested in blockchain, for example, doubled its market cap overnight.

The three-day chart MACD’s first bullish turn in over three months could bode well for bitcoin’s price, according to historical data. The cryptocurrency may challenge 2019 high above $13,800 before the year’s end.

The immediate outlook, however, is bearish and prices could drop to $8,800 in the next day or two, with the daily chart reporting buyer exhaustion. Further, China’s state media has asked investors to avoid speculative behavior which could dampen trading.

A pennant breakout on the hourly chart could yield a re-test of recent highs above $10,000, although that looks unlikely.

A widely-tracked bitcoin (BTC) price indicator has turned bullish for the first time in over three months, hinting that a move to yearly highs lies ahead.

The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram – an indicator used to identify trend reversals and trend strength – has crossed above zero on the three-day chart, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. A positive reading was last observed in the first half of July.

Seasoned traders may argue that the MACD’s bullish turn cannot be trusted, as it is based on moving averages (MAs) which are lagging indicators.

While that sounds logical, the histogram has a strong track record of predicting trend changes and big moves, as seen in the chart below.

The MACD crossed above zero in late December 2018, confirming a bottom had been made near $3,100 and remained in the bullish territory throughout the first quarter, even though bitcoin’s recovery rally remained capped above $4,000.

The cryptocurrency broke into a bull market on April 2 with a convincing move above a bearish lower high of $4,236 created on Dec. 24.

The histogram fell below zero on Nov. 14 as prices breached the long-held support of $6,000. What followed was a sell-off to $3,100.

Going further back, the indicator’s bullish turn in Oct. 2017 was followed by a meteoric rise from $7,000 to $20,000. Meanwhile, a drop below zero in early January 2018 fueled a deeper slide in bitcoin’s price from $13,000 to $6,000.

So if history is a guide, the MACD’s latest bullish turn could see bitcoin breaking out of a four-month falling channel and challenging yearly highs above $13,800 before the year’s end.

Supporting the bullish case is another piece of historical data that says BTC picks up a strong bid six months ahead of the mining reward halving due in May 2020.

So far, however, the MACD’s move above zero has failed to be reflected in price gains. BTC is currently changing hands at $9,470 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.6 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, having faced rejection near the 100-day MA resistance at $9,625 during the Asian trading hours.

Notably, bitcoin failed to close above the 100-day MA for the third straight day on Tuesday, having faced rejection above $10,000 over the weekend. as seen below.

Daily chart and hourly charts

The repeated failure to hold onto gains above the 100-day MA indicates buyer exhaustion. A similar sentiment is echoed by Tuesday’s red candle with a long upper shadow.

As a result, the odds of BTC diving out of the contracting triangle, or pennant pattern, on the hourly chart are high. At press time, the lower edge of the pennant is located at $9,260.

A breakdown, if confirmed, could yield a sell-off to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,820 (formerly a bearish lower high).

On the other hand, a high-volume pennant breakout, if confirmed, would imply a resumption of the rally from Friday’s low near $7,400 and will likely yield a quick break above $10,000.

China influence

China’s state media has called investors to stay rational and avoid speculative behavior. The warning has come after Monday’s sharp rise in blockchain-related stocks in China.

Investors poured money into bitcoin and blockchain-focused stocks after President Xi Jinping said last week that the world’s second-largest economy should accelerate its adoption of the blockchain technology.

The comments by China’s state media may force investors to scale back lofty expectations, leading to a price drop. A pennant breakdown, therefore, looks likely.

The overall outlook would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency invalidates the four-month bearish trend, as discussed on Monday.

It’s never far from being in the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. But in the grand scheme of things, it’s not that old. Bitcoin Cash was created in August 2017.

In response to Bitcoin‘s scalability challenges, its blockchain was hard forked to create a new coin, called Bitcoin Cash. Its creators wanted to create a cryptocurrency that acted as close to a digital version of cash as possible. It wanted to reduce the comparatively high transaction fees associated with Bitcoin to make everyday use of cryptocurrency a more achievable reality.

Bitcoin Cash tries to do this with larger block sizes, which means more transactions can be mined per block, in theory reducing confirmation times and increasing the speed of transactions.

However, this didn’t last for that long. Further infighting and disagreements meant Bitcoin Cash itself forked in August 2018, resulting in two different blockchains. Bitcoin ABC (supported by Roger Ver and Bitmain‘s Jihan Wu) and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (from Craig Wright).

Based on the stance most cryptocurrency exchange desks took, Bitcoin ABC continued to be recognized as Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin ABC/Cash continues to use the BCH price ticker while Bitcoin SV uses BSV.

As you might expect, given its close relationship to the OG cryptocurrency, BCH‘s market performance is never too far from Bitcoin. But let’s take a look at how Bitcoin Cash has performed recently.

A recap on Bitcoin Cash

Bitcoin Cash first came to market in late 2017, just in time for the infamous bull run that lasted until February 2018.

As with most cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash is yet to see the highs it saw in 2017 again, and has generally been on a downward trend ever since.

Bitcoin Cash had one up swing in trading price during April 2018, where its price shot up from $643 to $1,683 over the course of the month. A year later, at the end of April 2019, Bitcoin Cash was trading at around $293, a staggering 83-percent drop.

The cryptocurrency’s performance for most of 2019 has been somewhat uneventful. On June 16, Bitcoin Cash reached its 2019 high, when it was trading at $487.

Bitcoin Cash Q3 performance

Bitcoin Cash had a positive end to Q2, but that trend didn’t continue into Q3.

Across the first two weeks of July 2019, Bitcoin Cash’s trading price dropped from around $403 on July 1, to around $283 on July 16.

In the context of cryptocurrency volatility, this 30-percent drop is a somewhat minor price correction. Across the winter of 2017 to 2018, Bitcoin Cash saw its price tumble by over 75 percent.

After this market correction, Bitcoin Cash recovered enough to trade sideways for most of August.

On August 5, Bitcoin Cash reached a monthly high of $333, a notable 18-percent increase on the low it saw just a few weeks earlier.

Credit: eToro Bitcoin Cash mid-Q3 performance

However, that was as good as it would get for the digital coin in Q3. For the rest of the quarter Bitcoin Cash had a few price fluctuations, but it would close a long way down on where it opened.

At the end of August, another albeit minor price correction saw the cryptocurrency’s price drop by 11 percent from $304 on August 27 to $270 on August 31.

Bitcoin Cash did manage to stave off the doom and gloom for a little while longer though. In the first three weeks of September a steady price rally saw the coin’s price rise from its end of August low to a monthly high of $322 on September 18.

Unfortunately, on September 19 Bitcoin, Cash’s price began to tumble as the coin witnessed another sizable market correction.

On September 26, Bitcoin Cash was trading at just over $216, a 33-percent drop on where it was trading just a week earlier.

Bitcoin Cash showed no signs of recovering in the final days of the quarter. On September 30, the coin was trading at $223, 45-percent down on where it opened Q3.

Major events in Q3

Perhaps the most notable news for Bitcoin Cash last quarter came in September, when it was announced that Bitcoin.com was looking to launch a derivative for the cryptocurrency.

The timing of this news actually coincided with the small rally Bitcoin Cash saw in September, however, it wasn’t enough to encourage any kind of sustained growth. A Bitcoin Cash futures contract would be a long way off, and would need to overcome numerous regulatory hurdles before launching. Bakkt has done it for Bitcoin, so it’s not out the question that others will follow.

In early July, Scottish alternative punk-infused brewery Brewdog announced that it would be offering shares in its company, through its long-running “equity for punks scheme,” in exchange for cryptocurrency including Bitcoin Cash.

In the same week, Swiss fintech firm Amun AG announced a Bitcoin Cash exchange traded product, listed on the Switzerland-based stock exchange Six.

Neither of these announcements appear to have had any positive effect on the cryptocurrency’s trading price in the short term.

Looking ahead

It’s been a shaky start to the last quarter of the year for Bitcoin Cash. for most of October it has been trading sideways with no notable price swings.

Credit: eToro Early Q4 performance, Bitcoin Cash

However, this week’s news that cryptocurrency mining mainstay Bitmain had fired one of its co-founders, who was also the largest stakeholder in the business, is likely to garner interest from Bitcoin Cash fans.

The announcement was made internally to Bitmain by the company’s head Jihan Wu, a longtime supporter of Bitcoin Cash. In the hours following the news, Bitcoin Cash’s price increased by 10 percent.

Indeed, while this might be good news in the short term for Bitcoin Cash’s trading price, the long term impact remains uncertain.",2019-10-29,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-trader-bitcoin-price-may-not-break-all-time-high-until-2024/,"Bitcoin price is currently top of mind with most traders and financial analysts after the crypto asset made its third-largest ever one-day gain since its inception this past week.

The powerful move has once again renewed discussion around Bitcoin’s all-time high, in regard to what the price may be, and when it may occur. However, one prominent crypto trader who has made a number of accurate calls in the past believes that Bitcoin will not set a new all-time high for another five years.

Bitcoin All-Time High Coming In October 2024 According To Fibonacci Sequence

Almost two years ago, Bitcoin set its all-time high at the height of the crypto hype bubble, at a price of $20,000 per BTC. Since then, it’s gone through a painful bear market, and fallen to a low of $3,100 – an over 80% retracement from its peak to trough.

This year, Bitcoin made its first real attempt at setting a new record and brought savvy and risk-tolerant investors who bought the bottom as much as 350% gains at the latest local peak. But once Bitcoin reached $14,000, it was violently rejected, putting a damper on any talk of new a new all-time high being set for this year.

Still, crypto investors are holding out hope for Bitcoin’s upcoming halving in May 2020 to bring the asset to a new record high. Even a highly cited Bitcoin stock-to-flow model is suggesting that Bitcoin will be at least $55,000 per BTC around the time the halving takes place early next year.

However, another theory has emerged, and one that is steeped in mathematics. One prominent crypto trader who has made a number of successful calls – even calling for a blow-off top in early June and suggesting NEO would be among the first altcoins to explode in the aftermath – claims that Bitcoin will not set a new all-time high until 2024.

https://twitter.com/888velvet/status/1188992532602118145?s=21

The analyst’s theory is based on Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci numbers form a sequence in which each number is the sum of the preceding number, and the analyst is applying this idea to attempt to determine when Bitcoin will set its next all-time high.

According to the trader, it took Bitcoin 625 days to break above the all-time high of the 2011 bull market peak. Then it took another 1250 days to break above the all-time high set during the 2013 bull run.

Interestingly, the sum of 625 plus 625 is 1250, adding credence to the trader’s theory that each new all-time high is set at double the length of time from the previous high. Fibonacci sequence would then suggest that the current all-time high of $20,000 will not be broken until 2500 days have passed, or not until October 24, 2024.

While it may seem like an eternity ago at this point, Bitcoin reached $20,000 only 680 days ago, meaning there is still roughly 70% left to go before Bitcoin sets a new record price per BTC if the theory is correct.",2019-10-29 19:00:30+00:00,https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-future-of-cryptocurrencies-in-the-uk-hangs-on-fcas-decision,"Since the days of the British Empire, the United Kingdom has been one of the world’s largest and most influential economic powerhouses. Even though its financial control over the world has substantially decreased, the country is still one of the most culturally relevant regions in the world, especially when it comes to the adoption of a trend.

A survey by London-based law firm Michelmores LLP revealed that 20% of affluent millennials in the United Kingdom have invested in Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies. Keeping this in mind, when the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposed a crypto ban, it caught the attention of the entire crypto ecosystem.

Crypto regulations in the U.K.

Up until now, the U.K. hasn’t made any specific crypto-focused law, and its regulators have had a fairly lenient approach to cryptos. Although the country has no explicit cryptocurrency legislation, cryptocurrencies are not deemed legal tender, while exchanges have registration requirements and need to be registered with the FCA, whose guidance stresses that entities engaging in crypto-related activities falling under the existing financial regulations for derivatives (like futures and options) require authorization.

Related: U.K. Crypto Regulation Is Changing, Recognition Looming at Long Last

The gains and losses from cryptos are subject to capital gains tax and income tax. The U.K. tax authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), has specified that buying and selling cryptos will be considered the same as gambling, and the individual will be subject to capital gains tax. However, if an individual is engaged in trading of these assets, income tax would take priority over capital gains tax.

HMRC even requested that cryptocurrency exchanges hand over the names of their customers and transactions, aiming to identify cases of tax evasion, but the U.K.’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws doesn’t mention crypto specifically.

However, this will change by Jan. 10, 2020 with the impending implementation of the U.K.’s Fifth Money Laundering Directive. Talking to Cointelegrpah about the current regulatory situation in the U.K., Eric Benz, CEO of the exchange Changelly, said that the regulatory framework is attempting to keep up with the emerging market, adding:

“I do think regulation is a good thing but only if done in a way, which suits this new market. Applying traditional archaic regulation to crypto simply will not work as it’s been designed in its nature to avoid regulation. There has to be a much better understanding of the market and technology on behalf of Governments not just in the U.K. but globally.”

On Aug. 24, the National Liberal Party wrote a post on its website asserting that the U.K.’s current cryptocurrency strategy is nonexistent and affirmed the government has declined to take a position on regulation.

The FCA’s proposed ban

Back in July 2018, the FCA warned that cryptos pose a huge risk to consumers who are generally misinformed about them, and recommended that products such as derivatives and exchange-traded notes that reference crypto-assets were “ill-suited” to small investors. Sukhi Jutla, co-founder of the U.K.-based blockchain platform MarketOrders, said:

“The proposed ban will be seen as a major blow and backward step for innovation in the crypto-asset space. It will also signal that despite the U.K. being the leaders in the Fintech scene, they will have effectively be compromising on this position.”

This move by the FCA follows on from a public commitment to abide by the Cryptoasset Taskforce Final Report. Even though the report recognizes that cryptos can facilitate cheaper and more efficient transactions through the elimination of intermediaries, the majority of the report portrays cryptos in a negative light. In the report, the FCA mentions that it wants to “mitigate the risks to consumers and market integrity, and prevent the use of cryptoassets for illicit activity.”

Following the report, U.K. regulators ramped up their investigations on cryptos. As a matter of fact, crypto investigations in 2019 have surged 74% in comparison to 2018, and the FCA reported that crypto investors in the U.K. lost over $34 million due to cryptocurrency and forex scams from 2018 to 2019. Many, including Changelly’s Benz, believe that the consequences of the proposed ban would clearly make the situation even worse, since crypto will always find a way around the regulations:

“The decision to not have crypto investment products I feel is not the right decision but instead, the FCA should be looking to see how best to create a regulatory framework for these businesses.”

In an open letter on their website on Sept. 23, U.K.-based digital asset management firm Coinshare claimed the FCA has not provided enough evidence to justify the proposed ban on exchange-traded notes. It urged its customers to support them in “fighting these proposals by submitting a response.”

Government brushes aside inquiries on FCA’s proposed ban

On Oct. 21, the U.K. government made it clear that deciding whether to press ahead with the proposed ban is up to the FCA. This shows that the government is not keen to take part in the ban, or at least wants to distance itself from it. Talking about the apparent disconnect between the FCA and the government, Jutla of MarketOrders said:

“I very much doubt there is transparency of communication between the Government and the FCA.”

Jutla believes that governments are not comfortable dealing with the crypto industry and therefore, the government and the FCA may not want to move in the same direction. She said:

“Both parties have opposing agendas and viewpoints. Even if the FCA is not ready to embrace crypto assets, it has a duty of care to ensure that if these products are available, protection is in place for consumers and investors.”

Considering how the U.K. has already been failing to maintain its global leadership in finance, giving up on crypto innovation will be a major blow. It seems the country should draw some inspiration from the UAE government, which recently released guidelines on how crypto assets will be treated.

Mining rig manufacturer Canaan has filed for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $400 million on the Nasdaq Global Market. Prior to this filing, the company had also attempted to go public in Hong Kong and China. Credit Suisse and Citigroup are among its underwriters.

Canaan Files for US IPO

Canaan Inc., a holding company that owns China-based Canaan Creative, filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Oct. 28 for an initial public offering (IPO). “We are offering American depositary shares, or ADSs. Each ADS represents Class A ordinary shares, par value US$0.00000005 per share,” the filing details. The company hopes to raise $400 million.

The underwriters named in the filing for the IPO are Credit Suisse, Citigroup, China Renaissance, CMBI, Galaxy Digital Advisors, Huatai Securities, and Tiger Brokers. The company plans to apply to list its ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CAN. Canaan also told the SEC that, based on a report by independent research firm Frost & Sullivan which it paid for:

We were the second largest designer and manufacturer of bitcoin mining machines globally in terms of computing power sold in the six months ended June 30, 2019.

The company plans to use the proceeds to research and develop ASICs related to AI and blockchain algorithms and applications, expand its AI and blockchain business globally, optimize supply chains, and repay debts.

Canaan attempted an IPO in Hong Kong last year but let the application lapse in November. The South China Morning Post reported that Hong Kong regulators said IPOs by cryptocurrency businesses are “premature.” The company also attempted to go public in China three years ago through a reverse merger by buying a Shandong-based electric equipment maker, but that plan also fell through.

Canaan’s Nasdaq IPO filing comes only days after Chinese President Xi Jinping commented on the development of blockchain technology in China which sent shares of blockchain and digital currency-related firms soaring. Some even speculated that Xi’s speech caused the recent hike in prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

About Canaan and Avalonminers

Founded in 2013, Canaan provides “supercomputing solutions through our proprietary high-performance computing ASICs,” its registration statement reads. The company currently sells bitcoin mining machines under the Avalonminer brand and mining machine parts. In July, the company started leasing its mining machines.

The company’s total revenue was $394.1 million in 2018, a 106.8% increase year-on-year, but its net income fell 67.4% last year to $17.8 million. For the six months period ending June 30, the total revenue fell 85.2% compared to the same period last year to $42.1 million. The company also recorded a net loss of $48.2 million during that time period.

According to the filing, since the company has less than $1.07 million in revenue for the last fiscal year, it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). “An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise not applicable generally to public companies,” the filing details.

The company recently introduced two new lines of Avalonminers: the A1146 and the A1166. The former rig processes bitcoins’ hashes at speeds of 46-56TH/s, with a power efficiency rated at around 57J/T, and a price tag of $1,204. The latter costs $1,978 and performs at 66-68TH/s with a power efficiency of around 47J/T. Both are expected to ship in February, according to the company’s website.

That’s because President Xi Jinping called for his country to “take the leading position in the emerging field of blockchain.”



In doing so, Xi launched what the well-known podcaster and Bitcoin uber-bull Anthony Pompliano quickly called “the space race of our generation” on Twitter. “America has to embrace the technology, including Bitcoin, or we risk being left behind,” he warned.

Anthony Pompliano, is that you front and center? (via Wiki commons).

Given Xi’s near-complete hold on power and the flurry of pronouncements and exhortations of support that quasi-official Chinese sources released over the next few days, the Morgan Creek Digital index fund co-founder’s comment doesn’t sound unreasonable.

Later that day, however, the Bitcoin $100,000 proponent was back on Twitter, warning President Donald Trump that there was a Chinese plot to dominate Bitcoin. It’s especially interesting because Pompliano often touts Bitcoin as being out of the reach of any government. But that’s for another time.

“Someone tell President @realDonaldTrump that there are only 21 million Bitcoin and China is planning to buy them all,” Pompliano tweeted late on October 25. “This is going to be the real US-China competition.”

If that seems more than a little overblown, keep in mind that within 24 hours of Xi’s speech, the price of Bitcoin had spiked, rising from below $7,500 to more than $10,000. The cause, according to much of the Twitterverse, was Chinese investors pouring into Bitcoin because if the speech.

To be fair, the timing of the rally—it began just after Xi’s speech—makes it easy to see a connection, at least at first glance.

The problem is, Xi didn’t say anything about Bitcoin. And his regime banned all mainland trading in the leading cryptocurrency in 2017, although a great deal of it still goes on as does a huge part of its mining.

Which raises the question: who misunderstood him? Chinese buyers jumping blindly into a cryptocurrency the regime has been pretty clear it dislikes? Or cryptocurrency pundits and tweeters who saw a pro-Bitcoin attitude in Xi’s statement?

Maybe both.

China itself has been pretty clear about Bitcoin in the days since the speech and it hasn’t at all been positive. On October 28, a prominent think tank leader and former politician had called using Bitcoin to challenge sovereign currencies “delusional.”

And, the Chinese leadership did seem to buy into the theory that the price spike happened as a result of Xi’s speech. The People’s Daily, a newspaper run by the Chinese Communist Party, chimed in a day after that comment. It warned investors that “[t]he rise of blockchain technology was accompanied by that of cryptocurrencies, but innovation in blockchain technology does not mean we should speculate in virtual currencies,” according to Reuters.

Dovey Wan, a founding partner at Primitive Ventures, didn’t see a Chinese buying frenzy causing the rally. She tweeted out an interesting response to that theory, describing what she called, “the ACTUAL reaction on the ground to the Xi Blockchain shill in China.”

Wan pointed out that searches on WeChat for “blockchain” were up nearly 340% on October 25, while “bitcoin” queries were actually down about 5%. On Baidu, where she said more Bitcoin “newbies” tend to search, “blockchain” searches skyrocketed nearly 1,400%. Yet, “bitcoin” was also down about 5%. The next day, both search terms rose 250% to 300% on both platforms.

Her conclusion was that Xi’s “Blockchain shill definitely help[ed] Bitcoin awareness” but the bump didn’t come during the October 25 Bitcoin price spike. It was “more of a[n] aftermath,” she said.



Others suggested it was coincidental timing, pointing to the record volume on the underperforming Bakkt Bitcoin futures market. On October 25, 1,183 monthly Bitcoin futures contracts worth some $10.3 million were added. That’s double what the struggling exchange saw two days earlier and more than five times any previous day’s high, according to the Bakkt Volume Bot’s Twitter account. This added volatility, the theory goes.

Then there’s the tinfoil-hat brigade. (Of course, given the Bitwise SEC report claiming 95% of Bitcoin trades are fake, it’s worth noting that even paranoid people have enemies.)

Hyper gold bug and perennial Bitcoin basher Peter Schiff jumped in here.

“Bitcoin’s recent sharp rally likely had nothing to do with China, or any fundamental factor,” he tweeted. “It clearly looks like market manipulation by whales looking to sucker in momentum buyers… [so] they are able to dump more #Bitcoin at higher prices.”

Demand for crypto sharply increases in S.A.

Paxful announced the growth of its South African user base in a blog post published on Oct. 28. In the post, the company also notes that Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town are the three cities that see the highest numbers of users.

Paxful adds that the overall number of trades in the African continent also increased by 64% when comparing the current month with October last year. Furthermore, the platform reportedly now counts 3 million wallets and processes over 50,000 trades a day globally.

South Africa a hotspot for Bitcoin trading

In January, Paxful also announced that the volume of transactions it has processed from Africa has risen by more than 130% — recording an average of 17,351 trades per day at the time.

As Cointelegraph illustrated in a dedicated analysis published last month, Africa — mainly South Africa — is poised to be the next big market for cryptocurrency exchanges.

In June, popular Finnish P2P Bitcoin (BTC) trading platform LocalBitcoins quietly removed in-person cash trading from its service because of regulatory pressure. Meanwhile, volumes on the platform decreased to the benefit of competitors Paxful and HodlHodl who are reportedly seeing an increase in demand for cash trading.

The news came just days after Crypto Capital’s president, Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, was arrested by Polish authorities on suspicion of laundering roughly $350 million worth of funds from illegal proceeds and having ties to a transnational drug cartel. According to local reports, the arrested was tied to $350 million worth of funds previously seized by the Polish Ministry of Justice from Crypto Capital’s Polish subsidiary, Crypto Sp. z. oo.

Crypto Capital is a Panama-based firm that the U.S. Department of Justice claims provided shadow banking services to several cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitfinex, Binance, Cex.io, Coinapult and QuadrigaCX.

On Oct. 25, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex, issued a statement responding to Lee’s arrest asserting that Bitfinex was the victim of fraud perpetrated by Crypto Capital. The statement also rejected accusations that proceeds from narcotics allegedly laundered by Crypto Capital were associated with the exchange.

Relations deteriorate between Bitfinex and Crypto Capital

Crypto Capital’s partnership with Bitfinex has garnered significant scrutiny in recent months, with the exchange claiming that the liquidity issues had been triggered by an inability to access $880 million worth of its funds that were being held by Crypto Capital.

Last week, Bitfinex filed with a California court to subpoena the former vice president of TCA Bancorp, Rondell Clyde Monroe, with the exchange asserting that Monroe held information relating to its funds held by Crypto Capital.

Bitfinex claims that its partnership with Crypto Capital began to deteriorate in April of last year, following reports indicating that Polish authorities had seized roughly $350 million from an account belonging to Crypto Capital subsidiary Crypto Sp. z. oo. with Bank Spółdzielczy w Skierniewicach.

Bitfinex subpoenas Crypto Capital representative

In the subpoena, Bitfinex alleged that TCA Bancorp provided banking services to Crypto Capital, asserting that the firm had “used one or more accounts held at TCA Bancorp to facilitate the transfer of funds.”

Bitfinex holds that in August 2018, Crypto Capital informed the exchange that approximately $500 million of Bitfinex’s funds were being “held up” by authorities in Poland and Portugal. When pressed to provide evidence of the frozen funds, Bitfinex was issued a reference letter signed by Monroe stating that more than $300 million worth of Bitfinex’s funds were being held with TCA Bancorp by Global Trade Solutions AG, operating as Crypto Capital.

The filing requested the court for permission to accept Monroe’s deposition testimony. Bitfinex believes that Monroe possesses key information relating to the funds that were in the custody of Crypto Capital, with the exchange also seeking to obtain communications between Monroe and Crypto Capital.

Additionally, Bitfinex sought documentation of Monroe’s communications with Yosef and his sister Ravid Yosef, as well as Global Trade Solutions shareholder Reginald Fowler and his son Trent Fowler. Both Reginald Fowler and Ravid Yosef have been indicted by the Department of Justice for alleged bank fraud relating to a cryptocurrency exchange intermediary.

Bitfinex is also the subject of an ongoing investigation by the New York State Office of the Attorney General for failing to disclose that it was unable to access the $880 million in funds and that it had used a loan from sister company Tether to both continue operating and conceal the losses.

Crypto Capital’s past

Crypto Capital has been in operation since 2013, with Braveno’s Mathias Grønnebæk claiming that Reddit user u/bitfan2013 was the firm’s founder. In May 2013, u/bitfan2013 posted to the r/Bitcoin subreddit, probing the community sentiment regarding a proposed bank that would comprise a means to convert between BTC and fiat currency, in addition to providing services to companies operating in the crypto sector.

The poster asserted that his family and he sat on the board of directors for four “small – medium sized private banks” in Panama. The following week, u/bitfan2013 announced that they had decided to “offer private international banking to bitcoin customers, merchants and traders.”

In June 2013, Crypto Capital (then operating under the name Crypto Financial) launched, and then conducted what it called an initial public offering to raise 30,000 BTC through Panama-based Havelock Investments in August 2013. By 2015, Crypto Capital had attracted several notable exchanges as clients, providing services to Bitfinex and Coinapult, among others.

Bitfinex depended on Crypto Capital amid banking difficulties

Bitfinex’s affiliation with Crypto Capital became the subject of scrutiny in 2017, with the exchange directing its customers to deposit funds to accounts held by Crypto Capital subsidiaries following the Wells Fargo termination of banking services to Bitfinex via its Taiwanese partners in March 2017.

Stuart Hoegner, general counsel for Bitfinex and Tether, stated that the exchange expanded the number of accounts held with Crypto Capital throughout 2017 and 2018, as the platform became increasingly reliant on Crypto Capital for the processing of fiat services.

During November 2017, Bitfinex began directing customers to deposit funds into Crypto Sp. z. oo.’s account with Bank Spółdzielczy w Skierniewicach in Poland. The director of both Crypto Capital and Crypto Sp. z. oo. is Ivan Manuel Molina Lee, a Panamanian who appears to have acted as a nominee director for many Panama-based companies.

Crypto Capital accounts seized in April 2018

In April 2018, Polish authorities seized $371 million from an account held by Crypto Sp. z. oo. with Bank Spółdzielczy w Skierniewicach in Poland for alleged ties to Colombian cartel operations.

At the time, an individual posting on the Bitcoin.pl forum claimed to have been questioned by Polish police “regarding the case of Crypto Sp. z. oo.” as a result of having previously received funds from Bitfinex via the intermediary.

Bitfinex denied the alleged ties to the accounts seized and claimed that its operations were “unaffected” by the events. Crypto Capital accounts that had been operated on behalf of the now-defunct website Backpage were also seized in a sex-trafficing bust by authorities in April 2018.

Crypto Capital rebrands to Global Trade Solutions

After partnering with ING, Bitfinex recommenced directing customers to deposit fiat using accounts held by Crypto Capital subsidiaries, including the Swiss-based Global Trade Solutions via Portuguese bank Caixa Geral de Depositos in February 2018.

By the third quarter of 2018, accounts held by Global Trade Solutions were used to facilitate fiat transactions for Bitfinex via multiple U.S. banks, including Citibank, HSBC and Enterprise Bank & Trust.

In June 2018, Crypto Capital dissolved and liquidated itself, and has since been operated by Global Trade Solutions. Amid the restructuring, it became apparent that Crypto Capital had purchased a software engineering firm that was founded in 2001, which is presumed to be the basis for the “2001” branded on Global Trade Solutions’ logo featured on its website.

Tensions rise between Bitfinex and Crypto Capital

In chat logs documenting communications between Bitfinex executive “Merlin” and Crypto Capital’s “Oz” that were provided to the New York State Office of the Attorney General for its investigations, Bitfinex appears to have desperately sought to access its funds held by Crypto Capital from August 2018 onward.

On Aug. 15, 2018, Merlin stated: “Hey Oz, sorry to bother you every day, is there any way to move at least 100M [...] ? We are seeing massive withdrawals and we are not able to face them anymore unless we can transfer some money out of Cryptocapital.”

On Oct. 15, 2018, Merlin pleaded with Crypto Capital to provide Bitfinex with funds, warning that “too many withdrawals” were “waiting for a long time,” and that a failure to respond “could be extremely dangerous for [...] the entire crypto community,” adding, “BTC could tank to below 1k if we don’t act quickly.”

On Oct. 17, Merlin stated that Bitfinex “urgently” needed $100 million in “either Tethers or USD” within one week. The next day, Merlin told Crypto Capital: “Too much money is trapped with you and we are currently walking on a very thin crust of ice.”

Bitfinex among several parties affected

Crypto Capital’s fallout affected a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. In December 2018, Crypto Capital customer Coinapult announced that it was “experiencing issues” and that “withdrawals may take longer than usual.” The statement was the last made by the company, and it is currently unclear whether or not the exchange is still operational.

The now-defunct QuadrigaCX was also a client of Crypto Capital, with the exchange losing access to $190 million of its customers’ funds. Before the exchange’s collapse, Hanin asserted that the platform’s transactions were not being processed by Crypto Capital due to issues with its Taiwanese banking partner.

In May of this year, Minnesota Vikings’ investor and football entrepreneur Reginald Fowler was charged alongside Global Trade Solutions shareholder Ravid Yosef for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business on behalf of cryptocurrency exchanges.

According to the indictment, Fowler and Yosef have access to $345 million held in various international bank accounts, including accounts owned by Global Trade Solutions. Crypto Capital had also processed transfers on behalf of Bitfinex using Portuguese companies co-owned by Fowler in February 2018.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/30/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-backs-cryptocurrency-startup-after-turning-down-facebooks-libra/,"Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who recently said his company would never get involved with Facebook‘s Libra, has backed a cryptocurrency startup.

Dorsey, a longtime Bitcoin advocate, participated in CoinList’s $10 million funding round, alongside several other investors.

CoinList, which helps startups raise money through token sales, will use the cash to build CoinList Trade, a new exchange platform, and a cryptocurrency wallet, the Wall Street Journal reports.

This is the first time Dorsey invests in CoinList, which closed a Series B in 2018 from backers including Digital Currency Group and Polychain Capital.

Several months ago, Dorsey said he would pay developers to work full-time on Bitcoin Core and other “cryptocurrency ecosystem” projects.

Dorsey became Bitcoin’s unlikely hero after he was featured in Joe Rogan‘s podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, earlier this year.

Speaking to Rogan at the time, he said: “I believe the internet will have a native currency […] I don’t know if it’s Bitcoin, [but] I think it will be given all the tests it’s been through, the principles behind it, and how it was created.”

“[Bitcoin] is something that was born on the internet, that was developed on the internet, that was tested on the internet,” he continued, “it is of the internet.”

And just like that, Dorsey became the talk of blockchain town — something unsurprising in itself given that staunch cryptocurrency supporters are desperate for the technology to gain recognition as it continues its quest to mainstream adoption.

In an Oct. 30 press release, 3iQ announced that it had received a favorable ruling from the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) in regard to its closed-end Bitcoin fund, which is expected to be available on a major Canadian stock exchange by the end of the year.

In February, Canada’s markets regulator ruled negatively on 3iQ’s proposal to launch its regulated Bitcoin fund. However, the Toronto-based 3iQ appealed the decision and ultimately won approval from the OCS to launch its BTC fund. 3iQ chief executive Fred Pye said:

“Over the past three years, we have worked actively with the OSC’s Investment Funds and Structured Products Branch to create an investment fund that we hope will allow retail investors the benefits of investing in Bitcoin through a regulated, listed fund.”

Pye, who previously worked as senior VP at Fidelity Investments Canada, told the Financial Post that retail investors will be able to buy and sell the Bitcoin fund through traditional and discount brokers. The investments will also be eligible for Canadian registered retirement savings plans and tax-free savings accounts.

Gold recent tumble

Schiff’s comments come after a week of dazzling market gains for the top cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin (BTC) posting its highest intraday gain — at 42% — since 2011.

Against gold, Bitcoin was up by over 30% on Oct. 26, prior to Schiff’s remarks.

Twitter respondents retorted that the pattern was hardly unique to digital asset classes; those less generous sarcastically quipped that for Schiff, only gold is immune to such trading gambits.

On Oct. 29, gold notably fell to a one-week low amid buoyant investor sentiment in the wider markets, with many hopeful of a United States-China trade deal.

A hawkish interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve could, however, be bullish for the precious metal, with lower rates reducing opportunity costs for holders.

A store of value for the digital era

As reported, Schiff has been resoundingly and consistently bearish in his forecasts for Bitcoin.

Mounting recognition of the latter as a safe-haven asset has contributed to its moniker as “digital gold” and the cryptocurrency has more frequently fallen into close-step correlation with physical gold at several points in recent market cycles.

While some see it as helpful validation, others worry that crypto is diverging further from its anti-authoritarian roots.

Authorities in China have long discouraged investment in grassroots cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But the world’s most populous country is making significant progress with plans for a national cryptocurrency that could increase the government’s surveillance powers over the economy.

CoinDesk spoke with one anonymous bitcoiner who grew up in China and has since moved elsewhere in East Asia. Far from seeing blockchain “adoption” as a march toward liberation, he expects the government to use such technologies to increase its control over the population. After all, the propaganda office for China’s Communist Party announced a blockchain-based application over the weekend that allows members to pledge their allegiance to the party.

Given China’s mass detention centers currently being used to “re-educate” over a million Chinese Muslims, this bitcoiner feared local minorities will face even harsher conditions under a fully integrated financial system controlled by the government.

What follows is a condensed transcript of the interview with this greybeard bitcoiner, a programmer who started following the project in 2014.

The text has been edited for clarity. We agreed to keep the identity of this person secret because he feared repercussions for his family.

Q: What do you think about the recent “pro-blockchain” announcements coming out of China?

It terrifies the crap out of me.

Crypto is technology is just like nuclear fusion is just technology: You can use it to create nuclear generators that might benefit a lot of humanity, or you can use it to create atomic bombs. We do need to think about ethics when it comes to these things.

If the value is something a totalitarian state can take hold of and use to track every single person and what they’re doing, enforcing the strictest currency controls, then this is what they are going to do.

Q: Why do you think there are so many people celebrating such news this as a positive indicator for “adoption” in the crypto community?

People in East Asia are very comfortable with the idea that the government is like our parents, that they’ll take care of us.

Even if they read novels like Brave New World or 1984, the world to them is OK for the most part. But the few people who want to act in a way that the government does not agree with will be persecuted.

My parents have been [Christian] missionaries for about 18 years now, and being a missionary is outlawed in China. Our phones were getting tapped, our computer was getting hacked. My parents’ names were on the Chinese police blacklist. People like my parents are called terrorists or Tibetan freedom fighters.

In China, there’s very strict capital controls. So when I read about bitcoin, it was like, “This is a great way to store money with real censorship resistance.”

Q: How did you guys live under such constant surveillance?

We had very specific protocols for operational security. For example, when we’re talking over the phone or email, we switch out all sensitive words and make sure our servers are not located in China.

My parents once had their WePay and AliPay accounts cut off. But luckily they had cash, fiat currency and physical cash so they could live. If China had been 100 percent digital, there would have been no way for them to survive.

Q: How does your family use (relatively) decentralized blockchain technology today?

I don’t send my parents money in crypto. But my biggest fear growing up was that my parents would be deported. In China, after they tell you that you need to leave the country, you need to liquidate all your assets in 48 hours. We used to practice this thing where we’d pack everything we have in less than 48 hours. It was kind of like our drill.

Right now, all my parents’ assets are in crypto. As long as there’s one of us, somewhere in the world with access to our private key, our wealth is OK. It’s still very difficult for my parents to access their crypto, though. They can’t do it by themselves. They definitely need my help. That’s why I hold most of their stuff. In that way, accessibility [with crypto] is still lacking, even if it provides a store of value. And my parents don’t really understand crypto the way they understand banking services.

At the end of the day, censorship resistance is not enough. We need a private way of transacting and a way to make it accessible, understandable to everyone. We’re not there yet.

China surveillance image via Shutterstock",2019-10-31 10:20:11+00:00,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-may-see-november-price-boost-with-halving-due-in-six-months,"View

Bitcoin tends to pick up a strong bid six months ahead of the reward halving, according to historical data.

With the halving event due in May 2020, BTC may rise above the recent high of $10,350 in November and could challenge the 2019 high of $13,880 over the next couple of months.

Shorter term, a contracting triangle breakdown on the hourly chart suggests scope for a drop to $8,820 in the next 24 hours. The bear case would be invalidated if prices rise above the hourly chart resistance of $9,245.

A quick move above $9,245 and a rally to the 100-day average at $9,606 shouldn’t be ruled out, as the recent pullback from $10,350 lacks volume support.

Bitcoin will likely put on a good show in November with a price-positive event due in six months.

The number one cryptocurrency by market value is leaving October on a positive note, having recovered sharply from five-month lows below $7,500 seen a week ago.

The rally could be extended further next month, as the cryptocurrency is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May 2020. The process is aimed at curbing inflation by reducing the bitcoin reward per block mined on the blockchain by 50 percent every four years.

Currently, miners get 12.5 BTC for every block mined. That will drop to 6.25 BTC after the halving, meaning 50 percent fewer bitcoins will be generated every 10 minutes. To put it another way, the supply of new coins will drop by half after May.

In the past, the cryptocurrency has picked up a strong bid six months ahead of the reward halving.

Bitcoin’s block reward was cut from 50 BTC to 25 BTC in November 2012. BTC rallied from $5 to $16 in the three months to mid-August and built a new base around $10.00 in November.

On similar lines, BTC jumped from $360 to $780 in the four months to mid-June 2016, before trimming gains and falling back to $465 in August, when the block reward was cut from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.

The data indicates the market begins pricing in an impending supply cut six months in advance.

So, if history is a guide, BTC may rise well above the recent high of $10,350 in November and could challenge the 2019 high of $13,880 over the next couple of months.

Positive Seasonality

Adding to the likelihood of a rally, bitcoin has scored gains in November in six out of the last eight years.

Notably, November was a green month for six straight years from 2012 to 2017. The winning run ended last year with a 37 percent drop – the biggest November loss on record. Back then, however, BTC was in a bear market. The cryptocurrency had already dropped 70 percent from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.

This time, the overall trend is bullish, as indicated by the triple-digit year-to-date gains. BTC, therefore, is likely to revive the November winning tend.

Currently, bitcoin is changing hands around $9,100 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.2 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The cryptocurrency is trapped between key moving averages (MAs), as seen in the chart below.

Daily and hourly charts

Bitcoin has come under pressure in the last 24 hours, as expected, but the downside is being restricted around the 200-day MA, currently at $9,025.

The contracting triangle breakdown seen on the hourly chart indicates that bitcoin could drop further to the former resistance-turned-support of $8,820. A violation there would expose next support lined up at $8,474.

The outlook, as per the hourly chart, would turn bullish above the lower high of $9,245. A quick move above $9,245 cannot be ruled out as the recent pullback from $10,350 is accompanied by a drop in trading volumes. A low-volume correction is often short-lived.

A break above $9,245 would likely yield a retest of the 100-day MA at $9,606. Note that BTC has failed three times in the last five days to hold on to gains above the long-term average. As a result, a UTC close above the 100-day MA could embolden bulls, leading to a sustained move above $10,000.

No, it isn’t John McAfee’s call that BTC will hit $1 million, or $2 million (haha), by the end of 2020.

The prediction in question is one made by a user of 4Chan, who used an image of a Japanese anime’s main character, Asuka. As such, the prediction has been dubbed “Asuka’s Bitcoin prediction.”

The poster of this prediction predicted in January 2019 that the move to $3,200 on December 15th, 2018 was the final bottom for Bitcoin, that the cryptocurrency would hit $5,300 in April, that BTC would top $9,200 in July, and so on and so forth. The first three facets of his predictions came to fruition (surprisingly enough), and due to this, many believed that the seeming time traveler or market soothsayer had accurately foreseen Bitcoin’s price action into November 2020.

So at the start of this month, you had some investors buying into the theory that the prediction would play out, meaning that Bitcoin would top $16,000 in October. But right now, on the evening of October 31st, Bitcoin is trading at a mere $9,350 — dozens of percent shy from the $16,000 predicted by the anonymous 4Chan poster.

Unless Bitcoin’s price can surge by $7,000 (or some 80%) within the six hours, the prediction is dead. Sure, Bitcoin just saw a 42% day last week, but 80% is stretching it if I’m being honest.

This may leave you wondering — do bulls have anything to look forward to. According to a number of analyses, for sure. 100%.

Filb Filb argued in a recent Twitter thread that by the end of November or start of December, the 50-week and 100-week moving averages will see a “golden cross,” which he claims is far more significant” for the Bitcoin market that other technical crosses. As Filb’s chart below depicts, the last time the 50-week crossed above the 100-week, Bitcoin rallied for months straight, surging to fresh highs month in, month out. Historical precedence would suggest the same is about to happen… again.

Also, as reported by Ethereum World News earlier this month, Mitoshi Kaku noted that the one-month Ichimoku Cloud’s first lead line has crossed above its second, flipping green for the first time in months.

He wrote in a response to the inquiry about the indicator that this “could be the start of something beautiful”, referencing the idea that the Ichimoku Cloud is currently predicting that Bitcoin is soon to enter a long-term bull market.

Data gathered by analytics firm Coin Metrics revealed that over 200,000 bitcoin have now been paid in transaction fees since it launched in 2009 – three months after its creator Satoshi Nakamotoa, a pseudonym, published the white paper unveiling it to the world for the first time.

Nakamoto laid out the details of a “new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer” that negated the need for banks and other third parties, on 31 October 2008.

Its popularity has soared in recent years but despite transaction volume increasing considerably, the actual cost of transactions has fallen over the last year. This is thanks to the implementation of solutions like the Lightning Network, which helps speed up and simplify blockchain transactions.

“Bitcoin users transacted consistently on the network throughout the year, and solutions like the Lightning Network grew in size,” Galen Danziger, co-founder of blockchain accelerator MouseBelt,” told The Independent.

2019 has been relatively positive for bitcoin, especially when compared to the seemingly terminal decline the cryptocurrency market experienced in 2018.

After peaking at close to $20,000 in December 2017, bitcoin fell to below $4,000 before finally making a recovery earlier this year.

It still faces a number of challenges before it can ever be considered as a legitimate and mainstream form of payment, including regulatory hurdles, price volatility and security issues that make wallets and exchanges vulnerable to hacking.

It is estimated that around $4.2bn worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen by hackers so far this year, surpassing the record total from last year.

“As we celebrate the eleventh anniversary of bitcoin, it’s important to reflect on just how far we’ve come as an industry,” Pascal Gauthier, chief executive of blockchain security firm Ledger, told The Independent.

In fact, taking the plunge and entering the cryptocurrency sphere is a risk for anyone, with or without investment experience. This is because the crypto space has no centralized authority to guide investors. Rumors, hype and horror stories dominate the internet, and separating fact from hearsay can be difficult at times.

Like any other business venture, you should never get your feet wet until you have all the facts straight. Many Bitcoin investors who have taken losses will agree that they didn’t do their own research. Riding on rumors and hearsay is setting yourself up for failure.

However, the cryptocurrency community does come in handy for inquiries. You’re better off talking to people who are already in the crypto space. As a college student, you’ve got all the time and resources to find out all there is to know about investing in Bitcoin. As you find ways to invest, don’t forget to keep an eye on your academic performance, but if it does begin to suffer, online writing services help ensure you maintain above-average performance.

Research

The crypto space has existed for quite a number of years now, which means that so much has changed since its advent. If you’re just getting wind of Bitcoin now, you need to do your homework. You’ll make better investment choices when you understand what you’re getting yourself into. Even though cryptocurrencies offer a unique investment opportunity, that doesn’t mean they come without risks.

Treading accordingly ensures you miss all the potholes along the way. Dive into Bitcoin’s underlying technology and figure out how the whole system works. A strong grasp of how the blockchain stores secure data will help you understand everything pertaining to Bitcoin investments.

Don’t go through a few articles on the internet and conclude that you know enough about Bitcoin, because knowing it like you know the back of your hand takes time. Find a mentor in the crypto space who is resourceful and trustworthy. Ask as many questions you can, so that by the time you’re investing, you are doing so in a safe environment.

Ignore the hype and dig deeper to find out the truth. Otherwise, if you rely on the success stories as your guide, you’ll end up risking money you cannot afford to lose. Even though Bitcoin opens up an exciting world, the horror stories are proof enough that it can be complex and confusing, as well.

Baby steps

Knowing everything about the crypto world doesn’t mean you should dive into the deep end. Risk is inherent in every investment, and the crypto space is no exception. You need to proceed with caution, because digital currency is still in its early stages of development. There are extremely high risks involved, which means you can either win big or lose everything you have.

Start small and see how it goes before putting in more money. Instead of chasing Bitcoin prices, let the prices come to you. Timing is key when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency. Once you decide on an entry point, don’t change your mind just because someone told you otherwise.

Once the price gets to where you want it to be, don’t use all your capital to buy the coins. Buy in small quantities, investing a little at a time. The right way to invest in Bitcoins is synonymous with summoning a genie — one wrong move and you lose it all.

Broaden your horizons

Ideally, no investor should put all their eggs in one basket. When investing in the crypto space, you need to diversify effectively. This way, a decline in one component can easily be offset by an equal gain in another.

Aside from Bitcoin, you can also invest in Ripple (XRP), Ether, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Litecoin (LTC). Investing equally across different components maintains a balance, as all these components are within the crypto space, and if one drops by a given percentage, another is bound to rise by the same amount.

Be aware of all active cryptocurrencies and invest in them with caution. A cryptocurrency can easily fall because they’re like startups within the crypto space. Researching and keeping up with the crypto market is crucial because a currency can crash to the ground overnight.

Keep your coin in wallets

Since you’re investing within a digital space, you should keep an eye out for cybersecurity. Cybercriminals are all over the crypto space. Use exchanges to buy currencies and move your coins back to your wallets as soon as you’re done. Holding your assets in exchanges exposes you to cyberattacks.

Many exchanges have been hacked before, and this trend is not likely to change. Consider investing in cold wallets, which is another name for offline wallets. These are much more secure than hot wallets (online wallets).

Buckle up, it’s going to be a wild ride

There is nothing as volatile as the digital currency market. As a new investor, you need strategies to help you manage price fluctuations. Aside from diversifying, you should buy and hold Bitcoin — this means resisting any temptation to get into short-term bets. In the crypto space, passive investment has a better chance of succeeding than an active one.

Now that you know the best way to go about investing in Bitcoin, you can enter the crypto space armored with information. When it comes to investing, making informed decisions is key.

After sending a recent enforcement letter, the IRS has released two new pieces of guidance for taxpayers who engage in transactions involving digital currency.

The new guidance includes Revenue Ruling 2019–24 and FAQs, including guidance for using the specific identification method. Additionally, the IRS has published a new draft for form 1040 Schedule 1, including a broad declaration regarding crypto holdings or trade.

Here is a breakdown of these publications.

Revenue Ruling 2019–24: airdrops and hard forks

So, what are airdrops and hard forks, and what do they mean for the tax obligations of crypto holders?

In short, an airdrop occurs when a company distributes its tokens to a user’s wallet, free of charge, in order to raise funds, and in certain other cases, such as after hard forks. A hard fork is when nodes of the newest version of a blockchain creates a permanent separation from the previous version, creating a “fork” in which one path follows the new and upgraded blockchain, while the other follows the old path.

In Bitcoin (BTC), a hard fork is the result of changes in the blockchain rules, sharing a transaction history with Bitcoin up to a certain time and date. The most famous hard fork occurred in August 2017, when some Bitcoin developers and users decided to initiate a hard fork known as Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

The new IRS guidelines distinguish between hard forks and airdrops, stating that not every hard fork should be treated as an airdrop. Those who received new currencies in a hard fork are considered as having received them through airdrop and should report it to the IRS as gross income.

The new ruling also acknowledges the possibility that a taxpayer did not receive an airdrop, detailing that if a taxpayer receives new currency from an airdrop into a wallet managed by an exchange that does not support the airdropped currency, the taxpayer is off the hook. But, if the exchange later ends up supporting that airdropped crypto, the taxpayer is considered to have received the new currency at that time and is therefore liable to taxation.

While the IRS has made significant steps in regulating crypto, the new guidance raises questions about the request to tax airdrops when the crypto holder receives them as gross income, unlike regular crypto which it’s taxable events occur only on selling or exchanging.

Frequently asked questions

Back in 2014, the IRS issued Notice 2014–21, which describes how existing general tax principles apply to transactions using digital currency. This notice contained 16 Q&As, which have now been amended and added to the 2019 ruling, resulting in a whopping 43 questions and answers that cover the entirety of crypto taxation issues.

These are the main issues you should know:

1. Understand what Fair Market Value is:

Fair Market Value (FMV) is typically defined as the selling price for an item to which a buyer and seller can agree.

Cryptocurrency value is determined by the cryptocurrency exchange and recorded in U.S. dollars. However, when it comes to peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions or other transactions not facilitated by an exchange, the FMV is determined according to the date and time at which the transaction was recorded on the blockchain.

2. Determine the cost basis:

Cost basis is the original value of an asset for tax purposes. For digital currencies, the cost basis is the amount you spent to acquire the digital currency, including fees, brokerage commissions from exchanges, and other acquisition costs in U.S. dollars.

Your adjusted basis is your basis increased by certain expenditures and decreased by certain deductions or credits based on marital status, income, etc. To calculate an accurate cost basis, you must first determine which units of currency were sold, exchanged, or disposed of and match the buying cost for every unit sold.

3. Choose the calculation method carefully:

Here is the big news: For the first time, the IRS has clarified the preferable method of calculation for cryptocurrency, advising to use the “specific identification” method. This means identifying the exact unspent output Bitcoin transaction (UTXO) you have sold out of all the Bitcoin you had in your wallets, and then calculating your tax liability based on the sale of the actual Bitcoin UTXO.

If you are not using it already, you should use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. This method does not take real-time user activity into consideration. Basically, to calculate in the FIFO method, you need to make a list of all purchases and another list of all sales. Then, to do the matching, take the first item in the purchase list and calculate the tax results as if you sold it at the same price and on the same date as the first sale in the sales list. FIFO results can cause overtaxation, especially if you bought your first Bitcoins in the early years.

To get a complete and accurate report, taxpayers are encouraged to use the specific identification method. This method is used to track individual units of virtual currency. It is applicable only when individual units can be clearly identified to provide a complete report of crypto-asset movements, including addresses, wallets, exchanges, etc.

Taxpayers can identify specific units by unique digital identifiers such as private and public keys and addresses, or with records showing the transaction information for all units of a specific digital currency (such as Bitcoin) held in a particular account, wallet or address. Specific identification must exhibit the date and time each unit was acquired, the cost basis and FMV of each unit at the time of acquisition, as well as the date, time, FMV and sale value or price of each unit when it was sold, exchanged or disposed of.

4. Save all your documentation:

When compiling a report and filling out the appropriate documentation, taxpayers must report all income, gains and losses incurred by all taxable transactions, regardless of the amount. IRS codes and requirements are to maintain thorough documentation on receipts, sales and exchanges in order to establish validity on their tax returns.

On October 31, 2008, on the eve of Halloween, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper. Since then the revolutionary design of the network has changed the lives of many and has transformed how we look at money today.

The 11th Anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper

11 years ago today, at 2:10 p.m. Eastern Standard, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper to the Cryptography Mailing List. The service used was a pipermail message service hosted on metzdowd.com run by a group of cypherpunks. The mailing list message title was called “Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper” and Nakamoto explained that he had been “working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” The anonymous creator also revealed that the paper was hosted on the website bitcoin.org.

Nakamoto emphasized in his email that the main property of the protocol was that “double-spending is prevented with a peer-to-peer network.” He highlighted that there was no mint or trusted third parties and “participants can be anonymous” if they choose to be. The first email detailed that “new coins are made from Hashcash style proof-of-work and the proof-of-work for new coin generation also powers the network to prevent double-spending.”

The Bitcoin whitepaper announcement wasn’t a huge deal at the time and really only a small number of people witnessed the message and replied. So three days later on November 3, 2008, he decided to write the mailing list again pitching the newly published paper. The Bitcoin inventor mentioned some of the same things that were said in the previous message published on Halloween. A few people had replied to Satoshi at the time and one individual seemed to like the idea, but he didn’t think Bitcoin could scale. Nakamoto dismissed the scaling issue casually and said: “Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.” Nakamoto continued:

At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.

‘P2P Networks Seem to Be Holding Their Own’

Nakamoto also mentioned concepts like Moore’s Law and told the person that it would take several years for the network to grow extremely massive and “by then, sending 2 HD movies over the internet would probably not seem like a big deal.” The same day, Nakamoto replied again in regard to a few attack theories that could be associated with dishonest nodes. Again being the master of his craft, Nakamoto quickly replied and explained that if a “bad guy does overpower the network” the miner would have to outpace the system and it would be much like “bouncing a check.” “To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back. I don’t think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins,” Nakamoto stressed.

More than a decade later, the Bitcoin network and the cryptocurrency ecosystem have grown massive. There are more than 3,000 digital currencies listed on market capitalization websites and there’s roughly a quarter of a trillion dollars in digital currency value being held by people worldwide. Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper and the network that went online the following January created a system of wealth that transcends borders, governments, and corporate control. Nakamoto highlighted two days after his third email that Bitcoin was merely an efficient tool and it wasn’t the cure-all against the monopolistic system of force that still exists in society today.

“You will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,” Nakamoto remarked on November 6. “But we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.”

So far his forecast has been true and Bitcoin has ushered in a new form of money and a taste of true laissez-faire. People have been able to use bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to bypass state laws, sanctions, capital controls, and help people who need funds without restrictions. Since the birth of cryptographic currency, many other ideas have stemmed from the technological innovation and people are focused on building platforms like decentralized exchanges and concepts that utilize zero-knowledge proofs. The 11th anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper reminds people how powerful Nakamoto’s invention still is to this day and how it continues to transform the world of finance as we know it.

Deribit will reimburse over $1.3 million in losses from the BTC index calculation data issue around 21:00:00 UTC on October 31, 2019. The Deribit Insurance fund will not be used to cover these losses, but compensation will be covered by Deribit. — Deribit (@DeribitExchange) October 31, 2019

Exchanges such as Binance have already advised their users to modify email addresses if they were also linked to Bitmex. The blunder is a stark reminder to traders to use a unique email address and password for each platform, utilizing a password manager if needed.

The PR disaster was compounded when Bitmex’s official Twitter handle was briefly compromised, with tweets reading “Hacked” and “Take your BTC and run. Last day for withdrawals.”

In a statement, Bitmex cited a software error as the cause of the email breach, and stressed that, beyond email addresses, “no other personal data or account information have been disclosed and no further emails have been sent.” The statement also urged users to add official Bitmex email addresses to their contact lists and ensure Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all their accounts.

Tens of Thousands of Addresses Exposed

Bitmex deputy COO Vivien Khoo said that while the email was sent to the majority of Bitmex users, not all were affected. According to skew.com, the exchange – which operates out of Seychelles – has 22,000 average daily users. Larry Cermak said on Twitter that “30,000 unique emails in total” were jeopardized.

In the aftermath of the leak, Twitter was aflame with panicked users, some enquiring how to delete their Bitmex account and others claiming to have already received crypto spam emails. There was further anger when it emerged that Bitmex requires users to undergo full KYC, including a selfie with their ID and the word “Bitmex,” in order to change their email address.

The email breach does not come at a good time for Bitmex, which is reportedly being probed by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over whether it permits U.S. traders to use its platform. Armed with thousands of user email addresses, the CFTC may well step up its investigation.

The reputational and regulatory cost of the blunder is still to be counted. In the interim, neglecting to use blind copy on a mass email has given Bitmex and its normally ebullient CEO Arthur Hayes pause for thought.

According to Skew Markets, Bitcoin has been more volatile than other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum in the past week, which does not tend to happen due to the discrepancy in liquidity between BTC and alternative cryptocurrencies. The volatility of Bitcoin’s marked increase following a six-month low indicates that investors remain divided on the potential short-term trend of Bitcoin.

Given the stability of Bitcoin subsequent to achieving $10,600 in late October, some technical analysts favor a bullish scenario in which the Bitcoin price avoids a re-entry into the mid-$8,000 support level and looks to break out above $10,000. However, other traders still anticipate a deeper pullback, considering the entire run up to $10,600 to be a stop hunt, trapping long contracts across margin trading platforms and futures markets.

The bull scenario: clean recovery over $10,000 for Bitcoin

On Nov. 1, the highly anticipated monthly candle of Bitcoin is set to open at previous monthly candle openings, as the Bitcoin price has tended to record a large spike in value. After the opening of the monthly candle of August, the Bitcoin price went on to increase by more than $1,000, going from $10,000 to just over $12,200 over the following seven days. A similar trend also took place in September.

Based on historical data that shows a significant spike in volatility before and after the closure of a monthly candle, traders are anticipating that the Bitcoin price might test the $10,000 resistance level once again in the short term, TurtouseTraiding said on twitter:

“BTC Tomorrow is the day where the relative time period to the 2018 bottom ends. We already had a massive rise in price but bulls aren't out of the woods yet. Tomorrow is also the monthly close. Expecting a big move on BTC.”

Josh Rager, cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, similarly said that if the Bitcoin price is able to reclaim the mid-$9,000 region, it will likely lead the dominant cryptocurrency back above the $10,000 mark, an area considered as an important psychological level by investors, “Daily support below, while overhead is the weekly and monthly open (resistance) with a break and close above these areas on higher time frames will likely be a signal to move up in the $10ks.”

Scott Melker, a trader at Texas West Capital, described the current price action of Bitcoin as a largely bullish trend, based on its rebound from sub-$9,000, “This looks massively bullish to me. Price has broken out of the descending channel and is consolidating with the former resistance as support. Still long from $8.985.”

One potential positive factor for Bitcoin that could contribute to a short-term trend reversal to the upside is the increase in the daily volume of BTC on BitMEX, the most widely utilized cryptocurrency margin trading platform. BitMEX liquidations for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies in the past year reached $21 billion:

Throughout October, when the Bitcoin price portrayed signs of stagnation with a low level of volatility, the asset’s trading volume on BitMEX was hovering at around $1 billion to $1.5 billion, near to the levels seen in March 2019. The daily trading volume of Bitcoin then dropped below $1 billion on Oct. 12, down substantially since June when Bitcoin price hit a yearly high at $13,920.

Bitcoin’s trading volume on BitMEX is an important indicator for trading sentiment, as the exchange tends to see a mass cascade of long or short liquidations that trigger a big price movement to either the upside or downside.

The bear scenario: a bigger pullback based on fractal

A technical analyst and trader known to the cryptocurrency community as “Dave the Wave” has long emphasized the bear trend of Bitcoin since mid-2019, ever since the asset started to fall off from its spike to $13,920.

If the Bitcoin price is following a fractal, the analyst said that a drop to the $6,000–$7,000 range is likely in the short to medium term, adding that BTC has fallen back into the downside trend after its rise to $10,600. The analyst also noted that it is difficult for a two-day spike to dismantle months of BTC’s price action, suggesting that the abrupt surge to over $10,000 on Oct. 26 has not changed the course of the asset, adding:

“Was always unlikely for a multi-month trend to be broken on the basis of a two day spike. Has retraced near 50% already.”

Rager also explained that for the bullish structure of Bitcoin to hold, it will need to defend the $9,000 support level with strength and avoid a drop below $8,800. A bearish trend for Bitcoin could materialize if the asset falls in spite of the monthly candle close, which has historically been a period controlled by bulls.

Some other factors

Social media and search engine engagement for cryptocurrency-related keywords as a direct result of Chinese President Xi Jinping endorsing blockchain technology has increased, especially on Chinese platforms like Baidu.

Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has begun to support the Russian ruble on the platform, as the company is now targeting the Russian market. This is happening on the backdrop of Russia and China — with ambiguous regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrencies — beginning to see progress in developing regulations that may later play as macro factors for the price trend of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

However, cryptocurrency trading still remains prohibited in China, and the People’s Bank of China — the nation’s central bank — has no intention to publicly allow digital asset trading in the near future. Despite this, Bitcoin in China has good local liquidity, according to Primitive Crypto founder Dovey Wanshe:

“For fiat buyers, all the Chinese exchanges operate big OTC, Huobi OTC volume is around a few hundred millions of $ every day on a conservative side Local liquidity of Bitcoin in China is EXTREMELY good.”

With Bitcoin showing a high level of volatility — which it normally does not demonstrate — and potentially large markets for the asset opening up to blockchain technology, macro factors could add to the upside movement of BTC if it breaks out upon its monthly open.",,https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/19/11/14708931/crypto-industry-celebrates-bitcoin-whitepaper-11th-anniversary,"The world’s first cryptocurrency Bitcoin celebrated its 11th birthday on Oct. 31.

This is the day when an anonymous actor(s) publicly introduced the digital currency in a whitepaper entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

The Bitcoin genesis block was later mined by Nakamoto in January 2009 — creating the first 50 Bitcoins, and bringing the currency into real action.

Regulatory Hurdles and Critics

Through these 11 years, many prominent individuals and organizations, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and Jamie Dimon, have predicted Bitcoin’s “impending doom,” calling it a “bubble,” an “exit scam,” or even “rat poison squared,” among other things.

Many governments across the globe have also come around the idea of a decentralized currency.

Pizza For $91M, Anyone?

On May 22, 2010, Bitcoin programmer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 BTC to a fellow Bitcoin advocate for a couple of Papa John’s (NASDAQ: PZZA) pizzas.

Those pizzas sold for approximately $41 at the time, are now worth $91.3 million, as of today’s market price for Bitcoin at $9,137.4.

May 22 is celebrated as “Bitcoin Pizza Day” in the community and used to highlight the success of Bitcoin as a financial instrument over the years.

Bitcoin shortly crossed over $20,000 in December 2017, hitting its highest value ever before falling down again.

Increased Competition, But Bitcoin Still King

Digital currency tracking platform CoinMarketCap lists more than 2300 coins on its website. Yet, Bitcoin makes up for more than 67% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, while the other coins share the rest.

Bitcoin also faces competition from traditional companies and banks, who want to launch their own versions of blockchain-based currencies. But the most ardent supporters stick with Bitcoin’s decentralized model.",,https://gizmodo.com/french-students-will-now-have-to-learn-about-bitcoin-1839547502,"Photo : Amanda C ( Flickr

High school students in France may be among the first people in the world to actually understand how cryptocurrency works.

The Next Web reports that the French education ministry, Le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, will integrate cryptocurrency into its curriculum and teach students the influence that bitcoin has on the economy. An outline of the curriculum notes that under this new module, high school teachers will provide a basic overview of cryptocurrency so students can understand the framework of decentralized financial systems.

France announced the decision in June, but cryptocurrency reporters in the U.S. and France have learned of the new curriculum this week.

The education ministry recommends teachers use four educational videos that address questions like “Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?” and “Can Bitcoin replace the Euro?”

According to the cryptocurrency outlet Decrypt, the curriculum outline advises that students should watch the videos and discuss the differences between fiat money (like the dollars in your pocket) and bitcoin.

This is far from the first time academic institutions will be encouraged to teach students about cryptocurrency. A recent Coinbase report found that 42 percent of top universities feature blockchain and cryptocurrency course. But France’s new suggested curriculum is likely the first nationwide program that encourages blockchain studies.

No matter how you feel about cryptocurrency, encouraging young students to understand financial systems can only benefit them and the future economy. If recent generations of students had a healthy balance of STEM and economics in their curriculum, we wouldn’t be as screwed as we are now.",,https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/01/french-kids-will-now-learn-about-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-at-school-cest-woke/,"French high school children will soon learn about Bitcoin, after the cryptocurrency was added to the syllabus for Economics and Social Sciences.

Le Ministère de l’Éducation Nationale, the French education ministry, has outlined Bitcoin‘s inclusion in the curriculum, noting how it will use the cryptocurrency to help students think about the characteristics of money.

Given the pupils’ youth, Bitcoin will not be explored in great depth, rather it’s more of an introductory overview to help students understand the notion of decentralization in the context of mainstream financial systems.

As part of the course, the ministry has also created four explainer videos, which include “Can Bitcoin replace the Euro?” and “Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?,” to help students get a better understanding of how the cryptocurrency works and how it compares to fiat.

The news comes after a France‘s Financia Business School began accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment in October last year.

It’s also worth noting that several other universities across the world accept the cryptocurrency as payment and offer courses about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology to their students.

French President Emmanuel Macron has long pushed for advancements in technology and innovation, hoping to make France into an international superpower in both arenas — and his efforts have seemingly paid off as Paris recently overtook Berlin in terms of capital raised by technology startups.

Earlier this year, he commented on blockchain’s potential to make the agricultural industry more transparent, during a speech at the International Agricultural Fair, held in Paris.

A firm called Vault12 launched its new passkey security solution for cryptocurrency assets. Vault12 is an application that allows people to enlist their trusted friends and family members to help safeguard their assets. According to the project’s creators, the new application leverages the cryptographic algorithm Shamir’s Secret Sharing which allows keys to be split in a distributed fashion.

Distributing Digital Asset Seeds Using Vault12 and Shamir’s Secret Sharing

Vault12 believes there’s a dire need to safeguard crypto assets as the onset of blockchain-powered innovation continues to grow exponentially. Since the birth of Bitcoin and a slew of other digital currencies, various applications and devices like hardware wallets have been created to protect cryptos. Vault12’s new product allows individuals to take advantage of trusted family members and friends who are willing to help them secure digital currencies. Moreover, guardians are rewarded with ethereum (ETH) to protect the assets as well, giving the trusted network of friends incentive to be a safe keeper. The project officially launched at the San Francisco Blockchain Week and the company is backed by investors like Naval Ravikant, True Ventures, Data Collective, and Winklevoss Capital.

The Vault12 white paper explains when it comes to precious digital assets, there is an “unprecedented threat level” looming for people in need of a strong security solution. “To protect these assets, we need a new cryptographic security platform – one that does not leave security centralized in a single place, with a single person, on a single device or in a single organization,” the research paper details. In order to bolster the security of digital currencies even more, the firm created a decentralized storage system for digital assets via a hierarchical Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) system. The SSS infrastructure is a well known algorithm in cryptography designed by the cryptographer and mathematician Adi Shamir. Essentially the secret (passkey) is shared in the distributed Vault12 system between 3-5 trusted contacts giving each participant its own unique part.

Vault12 Hopes to Fill the Gap Between the Digital Currency Economy and Unresolved Security Challenges

Vault12 allows any owner to set up a vault with friends and family. Custodians can always be recruited from the owner’s personal network at any time. But high-net-worth individuals who need added security can opt for a professional custodian service (PCS). However, the registration for this service requires far more effort and additional safeguards like verifying the owners’ identity with a government-issued ID. “One of the unresolved challenges for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and the blockchain economy is the continued challenge and burden associated with securing crypto assets,” said Max Skibinksy, cofounder and CEO of Vault12. Skibinksy further added:

Previously, to keep our digital money safe, we had to keep our extremely valuable cryptographic backups on pieces of paper and store them in traditional banks. It was ironic. We built Vault12 to be an innovative, convenient solution that replaced this cumbersome process.

Vault12 Setup

Setting up the Vault12 application is a fairly simple process, but you need to decide on 3-5 trusted individuals to help secure your assets. That part of the process may take longer, but setting up the vault after this decision is made doesn’t take too long. The app works for Android and iOS devices and when opened, it immediately asks you if you want to set up a vault and then asks permission to access your phone’s contacts. The company claims the information is not held on the company’s server and you can skip this part and manually add each contact individually as well. After deciding on sharing your contacts with the application, the platform asks you for your name so you can be identified by your guardians helping you protect your vault.

The platform then requires you to choose the number of guardians between 3-5 contacts and the more custodians you use, the more secure the vault will be. Once you save the security level (number of guardians), you cannot change it unless you start a whole new vault. If you opted to manually add contacts, you can send them an invitation or scan their device if they already have Vault12 installed. To add digital assets to the vault you simply upload a picture of the seed phrase or use a file containing the seed. The application will inform you of how many people are guarding the seed held within the Vault12 system.

Overall the Vault12 method is an interesting, novel method of safekeeping digital assets but people may have a hard time with a few requirements such as sharing their name, phone number, and contacts. People also may not trust the upload part where the user is required to upload a file or an image that contains a seed phrase protecting digital assets. However, the project’s key elements are open source and Vault12 users can take a look at the ZAX relay network infrastructure and the distribution of how the shards work. “In the future, other elements of the platform will be released as open-source libraries,” Vault12’s website notes.

A global economic slowdown has already begun as central banks scramble to prop up their economies by printing more money. The last financial crisis was caused by banks and it is highly likely they’ll be responsible for the next one.

Keep On Printing

Just over a decade ago the world was plunged into the largest financial crisis since the 1920s. The US banking system single-handedly collapsed the world economy by over lending to cover derivatives trading. It took years to recover but it seems like the economic skies are darkening again.

Last week the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates for the third time this year. The move is largely to encourage spending and borrowing while discouraging saving. For President Trump, however, this is not enough as he wants negative interest rates.

In another typical Trump tirade the POTUS blasted the FED again late last week stating that the central bank is a bigger economic threat than China, which is having its own banking problems.

“The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar & Rates are hurting…”

People are VERY disappointed in Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. The Fed has called it wrong from the beginning, too fast, too slow. They even tightened in the beginning. Others are running circles around them and laughing all the way to the bank. Dollar & Rates are hurting… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2019

Most economists are in agreement that Trump’s war on trade with China has caused more damage to the US economy than high interest rates.

With the FED creating more money the dollar value deflates even further. Since 1913 the greenback has plummeted in value. According to research, back then a person with $100 could buy the same amount of food, clothing, and other necessities as $2,529 would buy today.

Former congressman and Bitcoin bull Ron Paul also took a swipe at the current banking system adding;

“The dollars that you work hard for are always buying less and less, yet the government tells you there’s ‘not enough inflation’. The Fed is a government-created monopoly that counterfeits dollars by the trillions, and you’re supposed to believe that this is “capitalism.””

The dollars that you work hard for are always buying less and less, yet the government tells you there's 'not enough inflation'. The Fed is a government-created monopoly that counterfeits dollars by the trillions, and you're supposed to believe that this is ""capitalism."" — Ron Paul (@RonPaul) November 1, 2019

Bitcoin Solves This

Bitcoin, with a predetermined supply, immunity from central bank meddling, and decentralization from any state or nation makes it the perfect solution for this problem. In theory Bitcoin would become the world’s currency giving the control back to the people, not the banks. A massively flawed banking system was the catalyst that spawned Bitcoin in the first place. As Satoshi Nakamoto wrote himself;

“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”

The banks of the world are starting to take measures to prevent another 2008, but the writing could already be on the wall. Bitcoin does solve this as it was designed to.

TNABC Returns to the Sunshine State

The longest-running and one of the largest crypto and blockchain conferences worldwide is coming back to Miami in 2020. The North American Bitcoin Conference has been a huge success since it started in 2013 and has seen crowds upwards of 20,000 attend the two-day event. The conference will return for its seventh year to Miami on January 16-17 to kick off the new year in 2020. The conference organizer and Keynote founder, Moe Levin, told news.Bitcoin.com that the Miami event will host a lineup of more than 60 world-class presenters that are deeply immersed in the Bitcoin, blockchain and cryptocurrency economy. Levin stressed that the speakers will be well-seasoned technology veterans who produce transformative blockchain software and work with these innovative concepts and ideas every day.

The first set of 2020 speakers announced for TNABC 2020 include crypto pioneer Nick Spanos, Shapeshift.io’s Veronica McGregor, Blockchain Tax Lead at Deloitte Alexia Hefti, Bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem, Bloq cofounder Matthew Roszak, and Marco Santori, President of Blockchain.com. TNABC has partnered with well known industry firms that are sponsoring the conference in Miami such as Bitcoin.com, Tradestation, and The Bitcoin Center.

A Pivotal Time for Crypto and Blockchain

The two-day conference will also showcase Q&A sessions, networking, investment themes, discussions about crypto regulation, taxation, and how blockchain is revolutionizing not only the financial industry, but a large swathe of public and private sectors worldwide. In the last seven years since the first TNABC, the ecosystem has seen crypto and blockchain infrastructure mushroom into a robust industry. TNABC is meant to keep everyone attending up to date in regards to the latest technologies being developed today.

Additionally, the Keynote founder detailed that the TNABC event will have a variety of satellite events like after parties, networking events, and hackathons.

“This conference comes at a pivotal time as innovation forces us all to make wise investing decisions,” Levin said during the TNABC announcement. “With an influx of new opportunities and new applications of the blockchain, Keynote wants to give our attendees the opportunity to meet the people and product they’ll be investing in and get a better understanding of the fast-expanding blockchain ecosystem.” Levin added:

We’re also excited for our attendees to meet and interact with our sponsors and exhibitors, who are the greatest blockchain companies active at the moment.

The conference plans to be another premiere event that melds the biggest names in traditional finance, banking, and multinational corporations with developers, executives, and influencers from the blockchain space.

The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.

The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a weekly newsletter focused on institutional investment in crypto assets. Sign up for free here.

Earlier this month, Heath Tarbert – the new chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – declared that ether, the token of the ethereum blockchain, was a commodity.

This is significant, coming from the regulator of one of the largest derivatives markets in the world. Why? Because it opens the door to the possibility of regulated ether derivatives in the near future. The chairman was even more specific: “I’d say it is likely that you would see a futures contract in the next six months to a year.”

The market got excited because this would enhance the token’s appeal to institutional investors. Derivatives enable hedging, which is a significant part of portfolio management and a solid support for long positions. A lively derivatives market, the reasoning goes, will encourage more investment, which will boost the price, which will encourage more investment, and so on.

Yet, with respect, I believe the chairman is mistaken. We will not see ether futures in significant volume on a regulated U.S. exchange any time soon. If ever.

Reputation risk

Although it’s not just about the lack of demand, let’s look at that first.

Ether futures currently trade on exchanges based outside the U.S., but volumes have been thin relative to the spot market. On BitMEX, Huobi and Deribit, three of the largest crypto platforms that offer ether futures, the average 24-hour volume is less than 10% that of bitcoin, while the equivalent ratio in the spot market is almost 25%.

The difference could be due to ethereum’s relative youth, and the gap could close as the network matures. Or it could be that bitcoin will always be the institutional-grade asset of choice, rendering ether derivative demand too insignificant for major markets to profitably develop.

Either way, demand can be flexible. The real barriers to a successful launch of ether derivatives go much deeper.

Underlying risk

Last week ethereum developers announced the target date for the next system-wide upgrade: December 4. This will be executed via a hard fork, in which the entire ecosystem needs to change – blocks processed on the old version will not be valid on the new. There are several of these coming up.

This introduces an additional element of risk into the market. Earlier this year, an upgrade was delayed just 48 hours before it was due to launch, due to a “critical vulnerability.” And while it is extremely likely that bugs will be found and fixed in time, there is always the “what if?” that risk-takers have to focus on.

Even more worrying for ether derivative watchers is the upcoming consensus algorithm shift. Ethereum currently runs on a proof-of-work consensus algorithm similar to that of bitcoin. It has long been working on a migration to a different system, called proof-of-stake, in which the amount of ether you “stake” gives you the credentials to validate transactions and append new blocks on the blockchain.

This is like changing the motor of your car while it is speeding along the highway. No matter how much testing is done and no matter how many parallel systems are in operation, it’s risky.

True, risk is precisely what derivatives were invented to mitigate – but the creators of derivative products like to have that risk reasonably quantifiable. While derivatives can help investors control risk, they don’t eliminate it; they redistribute it. The extra risk for exchanges will need to be compensated, and uncertainty of this magnitude could make ether derivatives prohibitively expensive.

What’s more, when ethereum hard forks over to its new algorithm, there is always a risk that not all miners will switch. The current ethereum network could continue to exist and perhaps even thrive if enough participants wish it. Which token would derivative contracts track?

Existential risk

Another risk looming over ethereum is that of a network rewind. In 2016, in response to a ~$60 million hack of an ethereum-based application, ethereum’s core participants decided to rewind the blockchain to its pre-hack state, restoring the stolen funds and creating a split in the ecosystem that persists to this day.

This was a few years ago, when ethereum was still young and many believed that such a large hack would stunt its growth prospects – few expect it to be able to successfully execute something similar today. But last weekend, ethereum’s creator Vitalik Buterin posted the following poll on Twitter:

Thankfully, the “never rewind” majority should reassure the market of the blockchain’s integrity and stability. But almost 40% of voters think ethereum should be able to, and the fact that Vitalik is even asking the question is a reminder that it is possible.

Ether may be a “commodity” in the eyes of the CFTC – but, traditionally, commodities can’t change their history or their characteristics. Has the regulator ever approved derivatives based on such a malleable asset? How would you even start ensuring that there is no information asymmetry and the risk is fairly priced in?

But there’s an even more existential question.

Regulatory risk

Ethereum’s proposed algorithm change could lead to a bigger adjustment: ether could stop being a commodity and become a security.

Under proof-of-stake, ether holders can “stake” their tokens in order to influence transaction validation and block creation. In exchange for doing so, they earn an income.

This exchange isn’t dissimilar to how miners earn rewards on a proof-of-work blockchain such as bitcoin. In proof-of-stake, however, the rewards are distributed as annualized interest as opposed to randomized payout making for more regular and predictable returns on ether.

Is this enough to make ether a security rather than a commodity? Maybe.

This would not invalidate any outstanding ether derivatives. It would, however, move them into the joint jurisdiction of the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

This becomes significant when you compare the two securities regulators’ views towards crypto assets. The CFTC has long championed the innovation behind cryptocurrencies – former chairman Chris Giancarlo is affectionately known in the blockchain sector as “Crypto Dad” – and the new chairman’s recent comments referenced earlier show that he seems to feel the same.

The SEC, on the other hand, has repeatedly blocked the issuance of ETFs based on bitcoin, on the grounds that it is too immature a market. If it thinks bitcoin is not ready, it’s a stretch to conclude it will think differently about ethereum.

This is likely to give any regulated derivative platform pause.

Investment risk

So, given ethereum’s development stage and outlook, as well as little evidence of unsatisfied demand, ether derivatives on a U.S.-based regulated exchange are unlikely any time soon. There are a lot of issues to work out, in a sector that is already giving regulators and infrastructure providers more than enough to worry about.

This shouldn’t affect the phenomenal amount of work underway on the platform. It is, however, likely to affect broad institutional acceptance of ether as an investment asset. Large investors rarely take unidirectional bets.

Does that matter? Not necessarily – development will continue, and ethereum could still end up being a new operating system for the economy. Ether was not created as an investment asset.

Then again, nor was bitcoin. Markets have a way of latching on to and commoditizing ideas, and ethereum may one day become the darling of the alternative investment world. It’s still very young, though, has many teething pains ahead of it, and a while to go before traditional financial infrastructure supports its entrance into the mainstream.

During a recent Congress hearing regarding Facebook’s digital currency project Libra, US Congressman Brad Sherman warned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have the potential to threaten the US dollar’s dominance over the global financial system.

“Cryptocurrency either doesn’t work, in which case investors lose a lot of money, or it does achieve its objectives perhaps and displaces the US dollar or interferes with the US dollar being virtually the sole reserve currency in the world,” he said.

Sherman claimed the US dollar’s dominance over other currencies brings multiple benefits for Americans, such as profits generated by the Federal Reserve for the US Treasury and the ability to influence other countries’ policies and actions through the use of economic sanctions.

“We stand to lose all that because cryptocurrency is the currency of the crypto-patriot,” Sherman argued.

Beating the dollar’s monopoly

This isn’t the first time politicians have expressed concerns about the impact of Bitcoin on the US dollar. In a May 2018 interview with CNBC, St Louis Fed President James Bullard said while Bitcoin is not a threat at this point, “we don’t know how the future’s going to unfold”.

He added: “The dollar has been the winner historically because it’s backed by the largest economy and a relatively stable policy in terms of low inflation, and that’s going to be tough to beat. But a lot of people here want to beat it.”

Meanwhile, a Congressional report released at the end of 2013 warned that if greater use of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies leads to multiple monetary units, the stability offered by a single, incumbent currency (the US dollar) could be threatened, particularly if new currencies continue to exhibit high volatility.

The authors said that if Bitcoins are substituted for dollars on a systematic, long-term basis, it would decrease the need to hold dollars and increase the supply of fiat money. This could reduce the demand for dollars, which would affect the rate of circulation.

Story continues

“In this case, for the Fed to maintain the same degree of monetary accommodation, it would need to undertake a compensating tightening of monetary policy,” the report said.

“At a minimum, a substantial use of Bitcoins could make the measurement of velocity more uncertain, and judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy uncertain.”

Crypto appeal grows

Although any potential threat to the US dollar looks a long way off, the substantial rise in Bitcoin’s value relative to the US dollar is likely to cause heightened concerns. Some analysts reckon the BTC/USD price could reach $100,000 by the end of 2021.

Several countries around the world have also made moves to shift away from the US dollar’s influence. Iran, for instance, recently launched its own cryptocurrency, and a group of several West African states plan to adopt a single fiat currency called the eco by 2020.

The biggest disruption to the US dollar’s influence, however, could be the issuance of a digital currency by a major central bank. If national digital currencies enable faster and cheaper international money transfers, they could be seen as realistic alternatives to the US dollar.

Viable alternative

Whether it is Bitcoin, a national digital currency, or another type of cryptocurrency, there is certainly a growing movement to replace a fiat-based, single-issuer global reserve currency with a sovereign-free, algorithm-based alternative. Many argue it would be more stable and trustworthy than the US dollar.

The main arguments against Bitcoin as an alternative are, firstly, a global currency needs to have a flexible supply and, secondly, Bitcoin is too volatile to become a universal settlement token for trading contracts. Some experts, however, argue Bitcoin’s volatility can be overcome by hedging exposure – and not necessarily against the US dollar, but against currency issued by a central bank directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.

At the moment, it seems unlikely that major businesses and governments will give up their preference for fiat, which gives them a degree of control. But as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies start to mature and gain wider acceptance, it’s easy to imagine a future in which the US dollar isn’t the world’s sole reserve currency.

The post Why Bitcoin is a perceived threat to the US dollar appeared first on Coin Rivet.",,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-huobi-to-ban-us-users-mid-november/,"Bitcoin Exchange Crypto Exchange Huobi to Freeze US User Accounts by Mid-November

Singapore based crypto exchange Huobi is set to freeze accounts controlled by US residents in an effort to crack down on those individuals violating the User Agreement, according to a post on their website. This announcement comes after a gradual depreciation of US resident accounts over the past few months and will end with a total freeze of all US accounts on November 13th

The Gray Area of US Crypto regulations

Exchanges have long had issues operating within the United States. Many countries in Europe and Asia have provided concrete legislation outlining how to operate a business in the cryptocurrency space.

However, the US has heavily lagged behind on that front. There is no real framework when it comes down to tax payments, running your business, not even the slight assurance by the government to pass laws regarding the same.

Huobi has long been one of the largest crypto exchanges in Asia. At points, they had the highest trading volume than any other exchange in the region. However when China and other large east Asian countries began cracking down on and regulating crypto-currencies, the company began looking towards global expansion by opening offices in Korea and later Japan.

Removing US User Accounts

Huobi has always had language in their Terms of Service banning US users, but there were many cases where US users were able to make accounts and perform trades on the platform. However, Huobi isn’t just running away with their American client’s money.

The exchange is providing a grace period for any remaining Americans on the platform. Until the 13th of November, users will be able to refund Huobi Point Cards and withdraw any remaining crypto funds from their accounts. For more information on the withdraw, check out Huobi’s blog post.

Is there any other kind though? Tron became a part of Samsung Blockchain Keystore; China's already looking at applying blockchain technology to cross-border trade finance, and China-based coins pumped hard; as BCH network security was in question, BCH rallied too, and then rallied some more on Bitmain drama. Meanwhile, only 10 out of the top 50 coins are green in a year, and when Ethereum introduces staking, the volume of staking activity will more than double.

As South Korea decided to invest more in blockchain, a group of blockchain advocates is trying to change the government’s stance on crypto, and Ripple invested millions in one of the country’s top university blockchain research units. Speaking of Ripple, Japanese giant SBI praised it, while also making millions with crypto. That’s not all, as it turns out that the U.S. still dominates in a several security token-related areas, Sberbank introduced a new low-cost, cross-border remittance solution to rival crypto, Dash responded to the confusion that followed the closing of its Latin America affiliate, Bakkt plans to test a new crypto product with Starbucks, tZERO won a multimillion real estate tokenization project. Also, as Alec Baldwin has been hired by eToro, we learned that Baldwins have been residents of the Cryptoworld for a while now. And a crypto deepfake sent a worrying message.
